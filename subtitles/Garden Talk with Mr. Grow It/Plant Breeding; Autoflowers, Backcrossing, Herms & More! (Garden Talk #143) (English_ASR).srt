Zaza from Zaza genetics he was on the

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,320
podcast once before back in 2021 episode

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,118
number 31 where he talked about breeding

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,238
on an intermediate level this time

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,039
around we're going to continue the

16

conversation I have a whole bunch of

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,640
good breeding questions for him this

18
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,119
time around and somewhere submitted by

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,000
viewers like you he talks about Herms

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,558
back Crossing breeding autof flowers and

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,679

58
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,038
brother good to see you man it's been a

podcast this is your second time on here

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,440
first time was on episode 31 September

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,400
12th 2021 so several years ago and that

63
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,639
one has over 52,000 views on YouTube

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
alone and I think it's got uh I don't

65
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,479
know another 10,000 Plus on audio

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,400
platforms so it did really really well

67
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,000
we talked about intermediate plant

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,719
breeding we're going to continue that

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,360
conversation today although I mentioned

70
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,000
intermediate there are going to be some

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,840
beginner things in here as well I'm sure

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
we'll touch upon so don't want to scare

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,400
away any of the beginners you know

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,440
you'll definitely be able to um grasp

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
onto some things on here that we talk

76
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,800
about today but first can you introduce

77
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,878
yourself for those folks that didn't

absolutely my name is Salam Salam Sims

80
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,719
uh better known as Zaza owner of Zaza

81
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,080
genetics uh I've been a breeder here uh

82
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,439
for many years um started out with

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,280
animals many many years ago um and

84
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,878
eventually transitioned into PL so

85
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,280
um uh New Jersey is where I'm from and

86
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,399
um I'm so happy to be here once again

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,919
awesome short and sweet and I highly

88
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,519
recommend after this episode you guys

89
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,559
seek out the first episode I'll

90
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,599
definitely have that Linked In the

91
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,759
description lots of good information on

92
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,079
that one and yeah let's continue on the

93
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,759
conversation here I want to start with

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,519
inex traits so first of all you hear the

95
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,798
word hermaphrodite a lot or Herm and

96
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,879
somebody in the comment section said

97
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,920
that's an offensive word is that

98
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,639
actually offensive should it just be

99
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,438
interex trait should we are we changing

100
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:51,318
things or or what um hermaphroditism is

101
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:52,598
is a scientific term so um you know and

102
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:54,560
when we when we think in terms of the

103
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,598
vocabulary and language is super

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,479
important especially being able to tie

105
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,639
those uh those certain words to other

106
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,639
words words and definitions and actually

107
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,958
being able to get that hands-on

108
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,318
experience so you want to practice with

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,640
um the actual scientific word as close

110
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:14,119
as possible so I recommend

111
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,000
Hite definitely no need to change it

112
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,879
okay and then I want to get a little bit

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
deeper on you know what a hermaphrodite

114
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,040
is so there are a couple different ones

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,919
right there's a female plant that shows

116
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,520
pollen sax and then there's a female

117
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,240
plant that shows nanners two different

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,439
ones can you explain the differences

119
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,038
between the two

120
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:37,038
absolutely uh so a natural Herm which

121
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:40,000
which is genetically coded um it's it's

122
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:43,599
there in a natural state um it it is in

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,360
the gene pool it can't be uh removed the

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,160
code per se cannot be removed it can be

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,680
um bred to a recessive state where where

126
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,800
it doesn't expose itself uh through

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
through selective breeding but a natural

128
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,879
Herm uh shows its characteristics by the

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,840
actual sack that we're familiar with the

130
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,038
ball sack um it it the pollen sack

131
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,638
stores and collects pollen and then its

132
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,478
objective is to once it's full open up

133
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,918
and release pollen to pollinate any

134
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,439
female uh you know within 3 mile radius

135
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:20,639
or whatever it may be uh so ultimately

136
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,439
it has a certain look the the balls

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,879
which are separate from the female parts

138
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,240
you you won't see them together you'll

139
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,120
see female parts in one place and balls

140
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,720
on another and um the the have the

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,800
agenda to basically pollinate a female

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,240
using that pollen sack um inside of that

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,280
pollen sack are staming um Stam which we

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,079
know as nanners so basically nanners on

145
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,719
on the other hermaphrodite uh which we

146
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,959
we tend to refer to as uh stress induced

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,039
a stress induced hermaphrodite will show

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:57,359
naners or or Expos naners and typically

149
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,639
its agenda is much different because

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,319
it's hidden it doesn't necess

151
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,600
necessarily want to be out and about and

152
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,199
show everybody what what it has going on

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,240
right like like the the male pollen sack

154
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,400
wants to just open up right there out

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,000
and about for you to see uh this is more

156
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:17,079
of hidden um because the agenda uh and

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,279
the reason why she's pollinating herself

158
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,680
using these

159
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,519
staming is because she feels stressed

160
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,759
enough to feel like she needs to

161
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,719
reproduce and possibly preserve her

162
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,639
genetics in case of an emergency

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,120
situation basically okay and you

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
actually have a video on your YouTube

165
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,519
channel the title is why your plants

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,919
should never Herm can you answer that

167
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,359
question here for us uh because it's a

168
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:42,680
sign of weakness um it's it's what we

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,439
know as an undesirable trait uh and any

170
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,400
any undesirable traits should be removed

171
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,000
to selective breeding uh by the breeder

172
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,159
uh you don't ever want to uh release a

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,240
product or or put a product out um and

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,199
and it shows any undesirable traits

175
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,800
similar to um the dog world if you're

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,879
buying or selling a puppy you don't you

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,639
don't want to have an aggressive litter

178
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,000
of puppies and you just you know selling

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,079
them that's that's a super undesirable

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,680
trait and that needs to be removed

181
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,639
before any you know anybody else can can

182
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,639
be in contact with it so same thing with

183
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,000
Herms so a breeder are they able to

184
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:28,918
quote breed out the hermaphrodite trait

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,800
or is it just go from a dominant to a

186
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,918
recessive and it will stay as a

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,360
recessive and there's no way of actually

188
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,598
breeding it out getting it out of there

189
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,400
completely that's a that's a really good

190
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,878
question so um it that is the case for

191
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,359
the natural Herm where like I said

192
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,960
genetically it's still going to maintain

193
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,919
um its cating within the gene pool but

194
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,318
you can breed it to recessive where it

195
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,038
doesn't expose itself nanners on on the

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,280
other hand they will be able to be made

197
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,639
recessive because it's due to weakness

198
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,679
it's due to um and and and it's that

199
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,840
that that that's more so closely related

200
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,120
to Darwin's theory of evolution in in

201
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,000
natural selection when we think in terms

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,478
of Only the Strong Survive um all

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,959
weakness can be removed um and it's not

204
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,959
coated it's a it's a what we know is an

205
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,638
inheritable treat uh weakness or Stam or

206
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,758
nanners inheritable treat so it could be

207
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,918
removed completely but one of the things

208
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,960
to kind of keep in mind is like when the

209
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,399
plant gets all the way towards Harvest

210
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,399
right and you push it even further it

211
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,199
could show nanners would you consider

212
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,038
still consider those weakness or like

213
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
all plants are going to pop out nanners

214
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,639
at the very very end if you push it too

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,399
far right well that's still that same

216
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,080
mechanism of stress that wants to you

217
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,839
know saying hey man I'm way past Harvest

218
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,240
time I haven't been pollinated I don't

219
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,120
like this something needs to happen now

220
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,440
um and that's still a sign of weakness

221
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,759
it's still a sign of stress

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,680
um a plant will um probably we could

223
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,278
it's safe to say that most plants will

224
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,439
exhibit nanners if you put it past a

225
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,120
certain um but some to the point where

226
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
you could actually identify them and see

227
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,679
a whole bunch some where it might just

228
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,480
be one nanner throughout the whole plant

229
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,799
because it's that strong enough to

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,320
resist um based on you constantly

231
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,719
selecting for Only the strongest stress

232
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,879
testing is very important so that's this

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,519
all directly related to stress testing

234
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,679
and only Strong Survive got it and I

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,320
think we're actually going to be getting

236
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,759
into stress test on a separate podcast

237
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,160
episode we invited Zaza onto the from

238
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,240
the stash podcast and we have a Hot

239
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,919
Topic I don't know if we revealed that

240
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Hot Topic to you yet or not but it's

241
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,439
going to be something along lines of

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,919
grower error or breeder error and I

243
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,480
think there's a fine line there because

244
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,799
sure plants should never Herm if it does

245
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,560
Herm it eventually falls on the Breeders

246
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,838
for not doing that stress test as they

247
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,838
should before releasing it to the public

248
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,680
but what if it's a grower error such as

249
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,760
they're just blasting with too too much

250
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,439
light like too closely they just they're

251
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,958
they're doing something wrong within the

252
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,399
grow too high of temps or whatever

253
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,159
they're they're stressing out Beyond

254
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,120
naturally stressing it out so we we'll

255
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,600
hold off on uh any comments on that

256
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,799
that's gonna be that's a whole episode

257
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,120
itself and I think it's gonna be a

258
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,919
really really good one so I was ready to

259
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,759
go right at it man I'm I'm glad you

260
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:30,838
stopped me man tune that was a good one

261
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,278
tune in to from the stash podcast that's

262
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,160
with me Rob from CLTV and pigeons 420

263
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:36,399
that's going to be a whole separate

264
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,439
conversation which I'm looking forward

265
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,919
to last question I'll have on Herms

266
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,720
before we move on this is a question

267
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,958
from an Instagram user so I actually

268
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,278
reached out posted an Instagram story

269
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,958
and asked folks if they had questions

270
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,799
for breeders this was a question they

271
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,000
want to know why are there so many

272
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,519
intersex plants popping up more often

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,720
across multiple

274
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,560
breeders because there's multiple

275
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,560
breeders popping up they they they don't

276
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,838
a lot of a lot of guys who consider

277
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,359
themselves or call themselves breeders

278
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,120
don't really grasp the concept of what a

279
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
breeder truly is so um they think it's

280
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,959
just as simple as one plus one and it

281
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,799
makes two and you sell two and and you

282
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,439
know when you got a ton of people doing

283
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,479
that you're going to end up with a ton

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
of undesirable traits throughout the all

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,360
of these different genan pools man man

286
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,639
that's tough yeah it me makes sense it

287
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,278
seems like everybody's a breeder

288
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,039
nowadays you know what I mean and

289
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,838
there's a lot of inexperienced people

290
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,919
and they think that just need to take

291
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,839
pollen from one plant and put it onto a

292
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,399
female plant and then everything's gravy

293
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,560
from there which is far far from the

294
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,679
truth so yeah that's it could be very

295
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,278
reason why a lot of these breeders are

296
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,399
having intersex plants because they're

297
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:45,679
just not doing it properly let's get

298
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,919
into another one of your video topics I

299
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,399
was looking through your channel by the

300
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,278
way Zaza had a a great Channel That's

301
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,600
dedicated to breeding and uh I'll have

302
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,958
them linked down in the description

303
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,879
section below so you can easily get to

304
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,359
his channel but lots of great great

305
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,399
breeding topics one of them is

306
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,839
stabilization versus uniformity so can

307
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,679
you talk to us about that yeah um

308
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,399
stabilization a term that we hear often

309
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,879
um stabilize the or this this this

310
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,039
strain is stable or you know um and I

311
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,958
think it's thrown around very Loosely um

312
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,000
when we think in terms of uh

313
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,159
stabilization stabilization happens per

314
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,958
Gene uh per Gene and trait so uh you

315
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:31,679
stabilize and isolate genes and traits

316
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,838
uh one at a time sometimes it's many

317
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,000
times it's give give and take so you

318
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:42,360
have to uh be be very mindful about how

319
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,679
you select but uh ultimately um that is

320
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,399
overall understanding so if someone's

321
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,278
like yeah my strain is stable and

322
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,720
they're really just referring to

323
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,360
uniformity of cross uniformity is going

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,879
to be complete homozygosity we spoke

325
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,560
about homozygosity and heterozygosity in

326
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,399
the the first episode we did originally

327
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,799
and that was kind of the introduction

328
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,120
for a lot of people to to those terms

329
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,759
homozygosity being complete uniformity

330
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,278
uh versus when you hear someone say hey

331
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,958
uh that strain is stable uh what they're

332
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,039
really referring to would would have to

333
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:23,799
be that that that strain is completely

334
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:28,000
uniform meaning that each Al for every

335
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:32,078
Gene is identical for Mom and Dad so Mom

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,399
and Dad each offer you two versions of

337
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:38,278
uh a trait or or you know and those

338
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,278
versions can either be different or they

339
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:44,439
can be identical uh if if Dad is

340
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,799
offering you a copy of blue eyes and a

341
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,399
copy of brown eyes that would be

342
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,159
considered heterozygous if Mom is

343
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,600
offering you a copy of blue eyes and

344
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:57,039
then another copy blue eyes that's

345
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,879
that's homo homozygous completely uh and

346
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:04,439
and if we have every Gene in every Alo

347
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:07,120
within the population identical on both

348
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,720
sides mom and dad that is complete

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,799
uniformity but you can just imagine the

350
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,040
time I mean even to get to the beginning

351
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,958
you you you're going to need a start

352
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,838
point of about 20 years of selective

353
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,879
breeding just to be okay now we can work

354
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,160
towards uniformity

355
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,039
so a trait can be stabilized within a

356
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,838
year two sometimes you know depends on

357
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,639
what your objective is talking about tra

358
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,800
I think a lot of people know what

359
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,600
they're looking for when it comes to

360
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,278
females whether it fenal hunting and

361
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
then using that for breeding or what

362
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,879
there's so many different things you can

363
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,278
look at and we that's I think another

364
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,958
thing we talked about in the first

365
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,799
episode but when it comes to males I

366
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,799
think there's a lot of confusion you

367
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,159
know what traits should people be

368
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,278
looking for when they're cultivating

369
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,600
males and and selecting for breeding can

370
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,879
you give us some examples of things you

371
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,480
can look for in regards to traits for

372
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:05,120
male plants AB absolutely um first one

373
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,440
um that is most important is Vigor

374
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,639
athleticism uh you want uh the most

375
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,560
vigorous of the um population uh to

376
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,480
start with and um then you can look at

377
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:21,039
flower um production and tpine

378
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,320
production you can do stem and leaf rubs

379
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,439
in order to see if you can get a little

380
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,800
tpine profile uh but ultimately um I

381
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,560
think Khalifa uh genetics my brother

382
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,519
Aladdin over at CA genetics said it best

383
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:39,638
uh he said it's it's really similar to

384
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:42,799
you um trying to determine a daughter's

385
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:46,198
uh BR size by looking at her dad so it's

386
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:49,000
like I I don't know you know cuz we we

387
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,159
we only want the female right but um how

388
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,078
how do we uh ultimately make a good

389
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,399
decision on a true breeder male when it

390
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,479
comes to um selecting and ultimately I

391
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:04,919
would suggest taking you I did a video

392
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,560
on on picking Ms too um so so for more

393
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,000
in-depth explanation you can go back and

394
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:13,359
look there but uh yeah

395
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,480
tpen um Vigor and athleticism number one

396
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,318
that I mean as long as you got that you

397
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,759
can you can W that's the most important

398
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,278
how about the cluster of flowers on a

399
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,759
male plant is that yeah absolutely okay

400
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:30,159
so that is something that's valuable to

401
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:34,199
look at and also structure as well is

402
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,159
okay yeah all good all good um things to

403
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,240
look for after you find the most

404
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:42,439
vigorous plant so um and then you can

405
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,079
ultimately make the best decision of

406
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,000
what you think the female may come out

407
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,838
to be but clone clone clone that's going

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,919
to be your ultimate key to going back in

409
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,800
time you know whatever clone and

410
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,879
document clone and document I clone

411
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,039
everything and I document everything

412
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,799
this clone I like it because it is I

413
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,759
like it because of is I'm keeping it for

414
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:06,159
this reason um and then we do that in

415
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,240
stages so this is early veg this is

416
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,600
Middle veg this is late veg this is

417
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,959
early flower mid so uh you know we can

418
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,639
keep track of everything and go back and

419
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,279
when our with our selections how about

420
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,759
the stem rub technique for male plants I

421
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,558
know there's some people against it they

422
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,838
just don't believe in it they think that

423
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,759
the smell is going to be different when

424
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,200
they do a St R in veg versus flour for

425
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,798
example do you feel the stem rub

426
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,480
technique is something that know first

427
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:38,759
of all do you do it and when do you do

428
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,480
it if you do it I do it um a little bit

429
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:46,279
towards like mid veg um I want to

430
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,000
see not necessarily because that is true

431
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,558
um typically that Aroma profile does

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,679
change once you're inlow the actual buds

433
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,000
it's not going to be the same as the

434
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,519
greenery that you're rubbing on but it's

435
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,880
the the kick like if I get a nice boom

436
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,798
you know hit me in the face and I'm like

437
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,520
like okay that's it you know that's

438
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,639
that's nice so so you're not necessarily

439
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:08,480
looking for identical Aroma but more so

440
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,000
um effect of how how you know like oh

441
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,798
that's potent you know that's you know

442
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,839
that's that's fire you know whatever um

443
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,679
that's that's kind of what you're

444
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,279
looking for not necessarily the exact

445
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,080
Aroma okay and then color another thing

446
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,960
that a lot of people go after I've got

447
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,359
male plants that had some purpling on

448
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,519
the pollen sacks which I thought was

449
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,158
pretty cool and I always thought to

450
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,440
myself I'm like hm if I select this over

451
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,520
some pollen sacks that are you know all

452
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,558
green for example does that give me a

453
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,759
better chance to have some colors that

454
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:41,158
come out in The Offspring oh yeah sure

455
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,440
absolutely and um when we think in terms

456
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,640
of back Crossing there so many different

457
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,759
and that's that's that's back Crossing

458
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,640
is is is a topic within itself I think

459
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,679
uh it's is another uh tool that's very

460
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Loosely um thrown around uh and and

461
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,240
people have uh little to no knowledge

462
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,360
when it comes to back Crossing they

463
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,038
don't understand it you know most most

464
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,158
people's understanding is you take a

465
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,599
mother to the to The Offspring and

466
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,039
that's a single back cross that's a

467
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,558
simple single back cross and it has its

468
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:17,038
own purposes but then you have a a a

469
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:21,558
trans a more more uh more in depth back

470
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:25,079
cross uh where it's it's recurrent where

471
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:28,038
um you're continuously back Crossing

472
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:32,319
through five or six times in order to

473
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:33,879
receive a certain percentage of the

474
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,279
recurrent parent you have a recurrent

475
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,039
parent and a donor parent uh the donor

476
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,759
parent is there strictly to offer you a

477
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,079
a particular Gene um so that Gene is

478
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,759
going to be fixed into your Elite line

479
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,678
versus you could and this is what having

480
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,558
knowledge uh gives you confidence

481
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,919
because um in many cases you would take

482
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,759
your Elite line whatever it is you're

483
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,919
working let's say um it is missing one

484
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:03,400
particular thing like uh resistance but

485
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,799
other than that it's topnotch perfect so

486
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,440
you would be willing to take the most uh

487
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:13,279
crappiest of plant as long as it has the

488
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,519
proper Gene for mole resistance and do

489
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,240
an outcross once you make that initial

490
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,158
outcross you end up

491
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,558
50/50 that 50/50 you're going to select

492
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,480
based on that Gene that you that you

493
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,279
you're tracking down um which is mole

494
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,640
resistance you go back to the recurrent

495
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:34,480
parent on a back cross that then makes a

496
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
new population of

497
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:40,319
2575 which means 75% identical to the

498
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,280
recurring parent 25% to what we know as

499
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,399
the donor parent because we only need

500
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,200
one thing from it and as long as we

501
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,280
continue the further we continue to back

502
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,080
cross to the recurring parent we push

503
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,879
out the genes for the donor parent until

504
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,399
eventually end up with about 98.6% at

505
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,840
about six six times if I'm my math might

506
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,640
be wrong but about 98 88.6% um identical

507
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,918
to the recurring parent but um only

508
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,600
maintaining one thing which we selected

509
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,360
for which is that mole resistance so

510
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,158
everything else the the the not Frosty

511
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:18,158
the run all of that stuff is pushed

512
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,840
out and that is a uh uh that's a real

513
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,320
back cross a single back cross is a

514
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,359
little bit different it's going to give

515
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:28,038
you the ability to take uh a gene from

516
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:30,918
one parent and uh introduce it into the

517
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:34,480
background of another parent but it's

518
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,159
50/50 still so you still have 50% of the

519
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,360
genes from the donor and 50% so it's

520
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,440
going to be a a much faster um result

521
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,678
but a lot of work that needs to be done

522
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,519
behind it versus a recurrent back cross

523
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,640
which you can instead of just

524
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,400
introducing a new Gene you're fixing the

525
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,840
Gene and then we have third the third

526
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
back cross which I'll mention real quick

527
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:01,000
and I I won't keep rambling on but um

528
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,240
it's it's a test trait uh a test cross

529
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,119
I'm sorry and and a test cross is

530
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,759
basically um using a back cross as a way

531
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:13,359
to identify a certain Gene that may be

532
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,919
dominant and determine um whether that

533
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,719
Gene is dominant or recessive and end up

534
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,759
with the correct ratio uh by by back

535
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
Crossing so if we end up with a one to

536
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,359
one then we know it's a heterozygous

537
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,038
dominant if we end up with a completely

538
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,158
um all the same dominant of all The

539
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,599
Offspring we know it's homozygous

540
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,760
dominant and that's a test cross which

541
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:37,839
is also a back cross as well so do your

542
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,879
research on back crosses everybody is

543
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,278
not that simple it's it took my guys who

544
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,919
have a really strong I mean three years

545
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,480
in just the basics it took them about

546
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,559
four days they really grasp the concept

547
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,360
of back Crossing it's funny you got into

548
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,240
back Crossing that was literally my next

549
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,759
question for you perfect and you didn't

550
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,400
even get a list of the questions this

551
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,519
time around man you're freestyling it

552
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,840
here so that's funny that you got into

553
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,679
back crosses what's a reverse back cross

554
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,720
hm a reverse back cross that I'm not

555
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,278
necessarily familiar with okay cuz I'm

556
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,038
growing a gelato

557
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,880
41 reverse back cross and I wasn't

558
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,679
entirely sure what that was it sounds

559
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,080
like it may be a certain mechanism that

560
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,759
was done before the backat cross like uh

561
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,319
It reversed the plant and then backat

562
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,319
cross something like that and it just

563
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:25,558
add in compound but that's technically

564
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,399
not a type of backat cross we have a

565
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,558
test cross a recurrent backat cross and

566
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,038
then a single backat cross those are the

567
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,798
actual back crosses those three um but

568
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,519
um yeah it was labeled as

569
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:41,519
RBX RBX okay there you go reverse yeah

570
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,839
so a rever probably reversal uh done

571
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,158
first and then a back cross so that's

572
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,319
that's fine as well I mean it's just a

573
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,400
compound of mechanics and and that's the

574
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,558
thing I think people get really confused

575
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,640
as well is that all of these different

576
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,639
mechanics s1's back crosses or reverse

577
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,038
back crosses uh whatever it may be are

578
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,480
just tools within your toolbox um

579
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,000
F1 F2 F3 every every time you make a

580
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,120
move you end up with a new population

581
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,880
that population has a a new purpose for

582
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:12,000
your ultimate goal later down the line

583
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,760
so when you see people selling uh this

584
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,759
back Cross or that back cross ask some

585
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,400
educated questions uh what type of back

586
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,119
cross was that what was the purpose of

587
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,000
that back cross um from my understanding

588
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,000
a donor parent and a recurring parent

589
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,079
are used to introduce a particular trait

590
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,599
which trait were you using and why are

591
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,960
you selling it that's what I need to

592
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,879
know I need to know why you selling it

593
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,679
because it's super important for you and

594
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,760
your ultimate goal right you you your

595
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,759
ultimate goal maybe 20 30 years from now

596
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,440
is to be complete uniform right complete

597
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,919
uniformity you want to make the perfect

598
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,840
strain for people um and uh you you can

599
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,880
only do that by preserving all of your

600
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:52,119
popular I have Dead Ops OG um I'll give

601
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,880
you an example you Mr Grow was the only

602
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:58,398
person that ever ever touch a S1 um many

603
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,720
years ago three I think CU and that was

604
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,398
only because I knew I know you didn't

605
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,600
like uh you know you would go test your

606
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,000
stuff to make sure it was female so so I

607
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,639
went into one of my population I said

608
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,480
all right well I'm you know give him the

609
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,240
s1's um you know that way he don't have

610
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,360
to test them but probably got about 20

611
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,720
something 20 I don't know for sure about

612
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,479
20 over 20 different populations Just

613
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,558
For Dead Ops so different F series

614
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,960
different back crosses different and and

615
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,079
they all have to be identified they all

616
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,240
have to be documented and we all have to

617
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,519
uh keep track of them so that 10 years

618
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,000
from now I don't know what I have to go

619
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,079
back and use oh man boom I got this from

620
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,919
10 years ago this back cross that I did

621
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,798
to do this oh it's perfect this exactly

622
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,360
what I need and I'm still working dead

623
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:45,398
offs 10 15 years from now but now I'm

624
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,319
even closer to uniformity um so so it's

625
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,879
just those tools so don't sell your

626
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:52,678
tools don't sell your F1 F2 F you know

627
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,600
F1 is is is where you are going to be

628
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,759
introduced to um hybrid Vigor and

629
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,038
heterosis your your potential of and

630
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,119
that's a phenomenon so it's not

631
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,079
guaranteed it's one in a million it's a

632
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,839
it's a treasure uh you're looking for a

633
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,319
treasure chest so you can't you don't

634
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,759
want to sell that you have to dig and

635
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:13,000
search and hunt for that um hybrid Vigor

636
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,000
and if you can find it um man you got

637
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,240
you got you got you got a gem and then

638
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,398
F2 is different because now that's the

639
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,798
only way you're going to expose your

640
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:21,119
recessive traits that's my only way

641
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,119
that's my only chance the only shot I

642
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,798
got to expose the recessive traits I can

643
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,278
go back in time I can go back in

644
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,359
ancestry I can see great great great

645
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,960
great Granddad I can see how he used to

646
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,719
walk I can see all of these different uh

647
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,360
just by going back in history um and and

648
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,480
we do that so um all of those different

649
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,398
mechanisms the s1's the f1s all those

650
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,558
different things they just different

651
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:44,199
Tools in your toolbox don't sell them um

652
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,798
each one has its own purpose uh document

653
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,480
that purpose make it important to you

654
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,759
and once it becomes important to you you

655
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,759
would never want to sell it you have to

656
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,000
understand your objective and what you

657
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,200
which direction you want to go you want

658
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,480
to go left you want to go right you want

659
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,640
to go up you want to go down you need to

660
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,679
know that before you move so um when you

661
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
have purpose like that you ain't going

662
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,480
to sell you know I can't sell that I can

663
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,759
give maybe a couple to you you know but

664
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,960
I can't sell so whenever you see me

665
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:15,679
selling these packs of Dead Ops it's um

666
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,558
stuff that I called out of my population

667
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,399
so and this is the thing once you get

668
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,759
your Gene pull to a certain strength

669
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,239
that's why stress testing is the most

670
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,440
important strength stress and

671
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,599
athleticism is most important vigor once

672
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,360
you get it to a certain point

673
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:38,278
um then you can be confident enough to

674
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:41,599
know that you won't have any

675
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,759
undesirables that other people will

676
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,678
complain about so I can give you my

677
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,200
throwaways but you won't complain about

678
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,320
them because they're not going to harm

679
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,919
on you they're not going to be stunted

680
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,798
they're still going to be good they

681
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,200
still you know it's it's just that I

682
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,519
don't for whatever reason I'm selecting

683
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,840
toward a certain direction and I have a

684
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,759
certain OB Ive and I need to accomplish

685
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,678
that by removing anything that's not

686
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,158
within

687
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,038
that uh which doesn't you know fit

688
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,519
within that criteria I want to bring it

689
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:12,558
back to back cross for a minute here

690
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,798
inbreeding so when you're working an

691
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,240
inbred line from my understanding you

692
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,599
get to a point where you should actually

693
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,919
back cross now I don't know if it's like

694
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,959
an F5 or an F6 but if you go if you

695
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,200
continue to go down the line apparently

696
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,240
you can come across like weird

697
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,399
characteristics or something like that

698
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,759
so in order to avoid that you would back

699
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,798
cross can you talk to us a little bit

700
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,480
about that yeah so um when you

701
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:41,720
continuously go through the

702
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:46,200
mandelian road to inheritance through um

703
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,278
F1 F2 F3 F4 uh eventually you do lose

704
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,519
that what's most important to us Vigor

705
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:52,319
this is why I always stress Vigor Vigor

706
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,200
Vigor because it's the alpha to your

707
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,639
Omega so when you continuously going

708
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,278
down down down you're losing all of this

709
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:06,278
vigor athleticism um and the only way to

710
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:10,000
uh uh repair that is to back cross now a

711
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,480
single back cross um can be somewhat

712
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,480
effective um it can be somewhat

713
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,319
effective it it just depends on how much

714
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
inbreeding depression you have so if you

715
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,480
have a severe case of inbreeding

716
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,720
depression then a single back cross

717
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,599
won't suffice you'll need to

718
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,200
continuously um but still it's going to

719
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,359
be a recurrent back cross it's it's

720
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,720
going to be a different type of back

721
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:37,240
cross and then um you know but just uh

722
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,440
for for a smaller uh less uh dramatic

723
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,798
case of inbreeding depression then um

724
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,200
you could just do a single go back to um

725
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,558
the the the right parent Vigor super

726
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,399
important that's why you always start

727
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,599
with Vigor you can you have the freedom

728
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,439
to move about when you know you have a

729
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,918
strong Foundation good another question

730
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,840
from a person on IG the question is does

731
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,600
a photo period need to be brought to F4

732
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,839
and and or stabilize before breeding it

733
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,398
into an Autoflower so that's a good

734
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,639
question so um we'll stay we'll stay and

735
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,798
I'll be able to answer that by staying

736
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,320
on the topic of back Crossing um if I

737
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,119
was to create a Autoflower I would do it

738
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,918
through a series of recurrent back

739
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,959
crosses um that is the method I would do

740
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,720
my first initial outcross with a photo

741
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:25,079
period and an Autoflower boom end up

742
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,798
with 50/50 half half then I would select

743
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,839
the best autoflow from the new

744
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,798
population to back cross to the photo

745
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,079
period eventually like I said we we'll

746
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,879
end up if we go to five six seven times

747
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:42,879
back cross we'll end up with

748
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:45,200
98.9% identical to our photo period but

749
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,720
now the autoflow

750
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,319
gene should now be dominant the problem

751
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,240
is is that the autoflow gene itself is

752
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:58,918
much more complex than just the photo

753
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,000
period Gene right the the autof

754
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,278
Gene is and I don't want to get too uh

755
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,599
complicated but we we understand melion

756
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:11,558
inheritance to be F1 F2 F3 Mandel uh uh

757
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:14,079
Gregor Gregor Mandel and his F1 F2 F3 F4

758
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:18,319
right that was 1865 it was a long time

759
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:21,199
ago from what he taught us others have

760
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:23,759
then started to you know understand

761
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,558
different methods and ways so um there's

762
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:31,440
non mellian um inheritances as well so

763
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:35,038
when we think in terms of

764
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,519
Mandel's uh laws we think of dominant

765
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,798
and recessive when we think in terms of

766
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,599
non-mendelian

767
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,440
laws or inheritances we we're thinking

768
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,839
about incomplete dominance uh

769
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,360
overdominance pseudo dominance thing um

770
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,759
and Autoflower is an example of

771
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,319
incomplete dominance meaning that two

772
00:31:53,759 --> 00:32:01,079
genes are expressing themselves at the

773
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:03,558
same time in um a way where neither one

774
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:07,038
is fully committing so it's

775
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:09,440
incomplete versus uh a photo period

776
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,240
which is a complete completely dominant

777
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,880
trait uh within within a photo period um

778
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,919
and that's just the complexity of the

779
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,960
autof flower so to answer your question

780
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,480
um a backat cross would be the way to um

781
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,240
if you wanted to Cross or create your

782
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,440
own autl a recurrent backat cross and

783
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,399
then once you get to about 90 something

784
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,200
per you need to do a series of selfs uh

785
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,479
probably you'll need to do some self

786
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,519
pollinations uh you'll need to do some

787
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,960
Mandel stuff you'll need to do some

788
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,759
whatever uh whatever mechanics that you

789
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,558
have in your toolbox you'll need to be

790
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,679
ready to pull them out so that you can

791
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,079
make your auto flow but it won't be just

792
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,278
as simple as uh Crossing this with this

793
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,038
it's it's going to be pretty but it's

794
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,638
going to start with a nice series of

795
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,759
recurrent back crosses okay now could

796
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,439
you hear me out could you take a photo

797
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,079
period in an autoflow

798
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,679
do that cross right and then The

799
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,480
Offspring is going to be

800
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:09,120
50/50 take an auto flow from there

801
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,079
confirmed a reverse it and then use that

802
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,918
pollen to like an S1 create an S1 then

803
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,720
would you have feminized autof flowers

804
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,880
at that point the whole offspring of

805
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,960
that or or no well well no it'll it'll

806
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,799
still give you a it'll just be a

807
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,360
percentage so every Everything is a

808
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,879
percentage and every you you think about

809
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,918
it like every cross starts half and half

810
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,278
and then every time you do another

811
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,960
successive cross you knock off another

812
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:38,480
half so now it becomes 75 25 um and when

813
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,399
we think in terms of

814
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:47,159
selfing it's not half and half it's more

815
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:51,479
so like 100 because um it's breeding to

816
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:54,559
itself so it's doubling up on whatever

817
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,319
genes that uh the the mother is already

818
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:02,038
expressing so whatever genes um that

819
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:06,119
shows dominant or recessive will be

820
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:08,639
double uh what it was in her population

821
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,960
once she selfs herself so it's a little

822
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,519
bit much more faster um when you

823
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,800
thinking in terms of selfing and and you

824
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:18,838
do get a higher percentage I think it's

825
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,960
uh 75 to 25 off the bat if I'm not

826
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,759
mistaken so I'm I'm terrible at math but

827
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,679
I'm I think that's about

828
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,919
it you touched upon testing a little bit

829
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,398
but I want to get a little bit deeper

830
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:33,039
into Tes testing so somebody creates

831
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:36,159
seeds and before relasing to the public

832
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,480
they do they should do a series of tests

833
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,679
some people just release to the public

834
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,800
don't do any testing which could be very

835
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,800
harmful right because you're you're

836
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,839
pushing things into the population that

837
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,760
it could be you know high percentag of

838
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,960
her aphrodites for example maybe the

839
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,320
intersect traits ends up being dominant

840
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,320
and then you've you've released it to

841
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,119
the public and all these people are

842
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,720
getting hermaphrodites happens with the

843
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,358
donuts triploid right it doesn't seem

844
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,799
like they tested did a very good job

845
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,799
testing that because a large percentage

846
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,599
I want to say 70 plus perc and we don't

847
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,920
know for sure ended up showing interex

848
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,359
traits I'm trying to avoid using the

849
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,119
word heraf I don't know why he said it

850
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,279
wasn't offensive but but anyways what is

851
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,838
an ethical way to go about having

852
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:19,200
gentics tested before releasing to the

853
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:20,799
public first of all understanding um the

854
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,118
mechanics of knowing what you're doing

855
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,160
like no one I think if people knew what

856
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,079
they were doing then they would

857
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:30,358
understand what was required they would

858
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,880
be more excited about um because they

859
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,880
they will have the ability to create and

860
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,640
really actually create and and have

861
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,880
influence on um moving and fixing traits

862
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,279
and and you're like oh man I didn't know

863
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,000
I could do this so I think once you get

864
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,440
to that point you you take it seriously

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,199
versus people just taking one you know

866
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,679
and then selling it and then selling it

867
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,919
and you know they never even see

868
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,078
anything they don't know what's going on

869
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,039
they don't they don't know what they're

870
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,960
giving away they don't know anything but

871
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,279
if you actually get here to a point of

872
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,159
understanding and learning and get a

873
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,240
strong foundation in the basics you do

874
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,639
become the Creator and you do take pride

875
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,919
in that and and you look at things

876
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:10,879
differently no right would you recommend

877
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,760
like I don't it's so subjective right

878
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,358
it's like if you're breeding you got a

879
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,280
batch of seeds do you then give it out

880
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:21,719
to say disperse 100 seeds to people or

881
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,920
500 seeds to different people around the

882
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,959
world and then have them grow it out and

883
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,760
then kind of give you feedback is there

884
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,440
like is is that a good number or should

885
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,000
it be kind of a percentage of the total

886
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,119
number of seeds you get or or what no no

887
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,039
you should never um that's a red flag

888
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,358
too that's an indication to me that the

889
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:45,719
breeder is not um doesn't really know

890
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:49,358
what's going on because um as a breeder

891
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:51,358
I need to build up my eye for selection

892
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,519
like it's not easy and I I constantly

893
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,318
say this all the time um 10 plants okay

894
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,159
cool 20 plants cool but you hear people

895
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,199
all the time man I'm that's not a phen

896
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,920
hunter phen hunter is thousand plants

897
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,598
you have no idea what it would take to

898
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,720
look at a th plants with all these

899
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,440
subtle differences so you really have to

900
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:12,358
train your eye and start with the 4 10

901
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:16,079
20 and gradually you start to notice uh

902
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,480
changes within how you see things and um

903
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,200
that that right there is is is what's

904
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,559
required uh starting small and then

905
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,358
building your eye up so that you can

906
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,358
select but not just trying to throw out

907
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,119
a million plants it's not going to to be

908
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:33,318
conducive to it's not it's going to be

909
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,880
counterproductive H okay interesting how

910
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:38,800
about testing for pathogens H vroid big

911
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,519
concern these days and that can be

912
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,680
within the seeds right if you had a

913
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,480
plant that hot plate and viroid and you

914
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,519
use that for breeding it could

915
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,838
potentially end up in the seeds and you

916
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:51,639
could potentially disperse some do you

917
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,358
recommend folks get seeds test or or

918
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,838
plants tested prior to to dispersing

919
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,759
seeds and we're just talking hot plade

920
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,799
and viroid but there are other pathogen

921
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,960
out there as well right so what's your

922
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,560
take on that absolutely especially if

923
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,838
you are operating these large facilities

924
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,719
and you are doing this um for profit if

925
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,799
you're doing this to sell seeds and make

926
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,279
money and you you know you you you have

927
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,200
a big facility and all these things you

928
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,880
need to take every precaution um and you

929
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,199
should uh go over and Beyond uh when it

930
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,358
comes to stress testing performance

931
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:29,519
testing um just like um any responsible

932
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:31,358
breeder would um I'm I don't want to

933
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,239
release I don't want anybody to see

934
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,159
anything that is created by me but

935
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:39,879
that's less desirable like I don't I

936
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,559
don't even even with the notation of

937
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,280
saying hey um this is just testers man

938
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,039
don't worry about it if it if it looks

939
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,560
messed up don't even worry about it it's

940
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,318
just no that's not so so nothing leaves

941
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,920
my house messed up it's it's already

942
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:55,719
built up strong confid is ready to leave

943
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,800
the door when you step out the door do

944
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:00,838
you walk out you you know like messed up

945
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,039
pants halfway up you know dirty you

946
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,679
having [ __ ] no you you dress up you

947
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,519
brush your teeth you you get yourself

948
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,239
together and then you leave same thing

949
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,400
these seeds these these genetics don't

950
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,838
leave your house unless they are are

951
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,559
ready to to dress and impress so you

952
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,318
don't have like a team of testers that

953
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:19,799
will test your stuff prior to releasing

954
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:21,800
you just do everything 100% your eyes

955
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,240
your testing doesn't leave your house

956
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,200
unless you're confident with everything

957
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:31,000
that you are looking for you want it to

958
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:34,199
be yeah never um uh never never uh

959
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,440
believed in in testing um and I come

960
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:40,039
from the dog world too so um there is no

961
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,838
no testing um if if I'm looking for

962
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,599
undesirable trait that undesirable trait

963
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,039
could be aggression I can't just hey man

964
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:50,079
hold this dog and let me know if it's

965
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:53,199
aggressive one day the dog pulls you out

966
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,880
the bed you know you like so um

967
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,078
ultimately yes it's the Breeders it's

968
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,200
the breeder's responsibility for sure

969
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,440
okay

970
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,439
let's flip it up I want to talk about

971
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,720
your Creations here what are some of the

972
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,318
most exciting or unique strains that

973
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:11,199
you've developed and what makes them

974
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:15,000
Stand Out gotta um so dud Ops OG is

975
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:19,118
probably uh my my favorite it's a a

976
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,800
hybrid Cross of two land races from two

977
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,640
different areas and um two sort of

978
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,079
heirlooms uh and uh that is skunk number

979
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:32,039
one in UK cheese and on the other end

980
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,440
there the Kash plant and um the uh

981
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,960
ubekistan land race and um one from a

982
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,318
cold region one from a warmer region but

983
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,559
um land race just the land race

984
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:46,358
influence and being able to uh see the

985
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:50,799
history of of of just the Bal how rich

986
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:53,279
the history is with um being able to um

987
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,200
use that and know that it is responsible

988
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,280
for creating some of the uh most

989
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,239
valuable hashes around the world you

990
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,800
know for thousands of years right from

991
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,519
that region in Northern Afghanistan and

992
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,119
um learning The Villages and learning

993
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,838
the different um and then uckan the

994
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:15,480
colder region over there so I I love the

995
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:17,679
L race uh influences um I uh for me it's

996
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,079
just another baby of mine um it's

997
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,118
nowhere near complete uh it's probably

998
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,400
like 5 years in the in the workings

999
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,318
right now I've been working on it for

1000
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:31,480
about 5 years so um and we constantly

1001
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:34,838
just prioritize and um figure what is uh

1002
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,199
important at the moment um whether it's

1003
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,719
the customer is requiring something you

1004
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:43,318
know it's always a way you can make it

1005
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,959
better so um Dead Ops OG I would have to

1006
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,679
say I don't have too many strings I have

1007
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,720
a bondas glue which is a autoflow um

1008
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,838
that's usually always on the back burner

1009
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:55,199
uh rarely do I ever work two strings at

1010
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:57,559
once um it's it's not that easy um it

1011
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,039
requires tons and tons of population

1012
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,279
like I said so if I'm over here messing

1013
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,920
around with 13 14 different batches of

1014
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,920
dead opsy I don't want to be doing

1015
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,000
nothing else with no other seeds so um

1016
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,680
you know rarely do I ever work two

1017
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,880
strains at once so um I am working on

1018
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,559
the autoflow though um it's a Siberian

1019
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,318
ruderalis times de Ops photo period so

1020
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,880
we're doing the uh autoflow from scratch

1021
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:25,400
using the recurrent backat Crossing

1022
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,039
method and um probably some further

1023
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,000
self-pollination to lock it in um

1024
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,838
probably take about three four years

1025
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,239
three three years I'm assuming hopefully

1026
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:37,838
awesome yeah I had the opportunity to

1027
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,558
grow Dead Ops I think I had the f2s I

1028
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,199
grew out like two of the f2s and then F4

1029
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,559
good got some okay good you had some

1030
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:47,558
okay I thought I gave you S1 was they

1031
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:50,200
feminized I don't think so I don't all

1032
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,680
right cool maybe that wasn't you

1033
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:57,039
sorry like d could no wonder you was

1034
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,039
looking at me like that like I

1035
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,159
was I wasn't sure but yeah I'm pretty

1036
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,838
sure it was an F2 you probably remember

1037
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:06,000
better than I do I'm tell you I'm burnt

1038
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,759
man I'm burnt but it got some really

1039
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,079
good results off the f2s and I know that

1040
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,359
kind of opens up the the the

1041
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:15,039
characteristics a lot on that generation

1042
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:16,679
and the f4s it was cool to see like what

1043
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,318
really more of what the breeder is

1044
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,639
looking for more what you're looking for

1045
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,920
man that

1046
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,440
fuel oh I loved it so um actually I'm

1047
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,159
running out of stock right now I got

1048
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,119
probably got to plant another one and

1049
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,399
it's something I would definitely want

1050
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,318
to keep on hand at all times to consume

1051
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,280
you know I really like it a thank you

1052
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,159
man that's a vote of confidence for sure

1053
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,920
and um I'm I'm sure I still got those

1054
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:42,598
same populations hanging around like I

1055
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,800
got s1's I got f1s I got you know all

1056
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,559
Dead Ops so um and they all have a

1057
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,359
different purpose man they all have a

1058
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,240
they're all just a tool in the toolbx

1059
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,480
and when you realize that that all of

1060
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,159
these tools and you realize how

1061
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,559
important they are and you realize your

1062
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,078
end goal and you you start to see

1063
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,240
certain strategies that you want to imp

1064
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,960
imp then everything becomes important

1065
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:02,679
you can't sell that you're like man what

1066
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,519
if that guy opens up a pack and gets

1067
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,159
what you know gets what I'm looking for

1068
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,838
that helps me finish what I'm doing over

1069
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:12,199
here so it's all about U being objective

1070
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:14,599
and and knowing that uh it takes time

1071
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:16,838
man it takes time it's not going to be

1072
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,559
overnight you know we don't we don't do

1073
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:21,279
this to to make money off of it um you

1074
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,359
do this and you find other ways to make

1075
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,800
money around it but no breeder um is

1076
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:30,960
really into this uh for for money um I

1077
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,280
mean you might see some dog guys that

1078
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,559
that have successfully been able to uh

1079
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,359
capitalize off of new newly created

1080
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,880
breeds but um when it comes to guys who

1081
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:46,159
really

1082
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,200
understand uh the objective of a breeder

1083
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,199
um money becomes like the last you know

1084
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,199
we don't we don't make money man we we

1085
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,159
preserve genetics we save endanger

1086
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:58,519
species man we we we we actually have a

1087
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:02,078
hand in doing something great and being

1088
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:04,480
a part of History uh and saying man that

1089
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,920
pterodactyl over there man he was about

1090
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,199
to die but I was able to help bring

1091
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,880
those eggs back and you know whatever

1092
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,919
whatever it may be uh a dog a puppy a

1093
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,680
cat a rabbit um if it's endangered um

1094
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,400
and you know you have the ability to

1095
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,318
help recreate and and and replenish um

1096
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,599
and and not only that but um enhance so

1097
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,639
make it better um so that other people

1098
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,440
can have too that's that's what this is

1099
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:35,519
really all about and if you walk into

1100
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,400
any of your local uh uh uh shops

1101
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,079
whatever you want to call them um none

1102
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,599
of them have land races um they don't

1103
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,400
have that available for you because

1104
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,200
they're endangered species as well so

1105
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,000
just think about that the next time you

1106
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:52,439
are looking for your next uh two mother

1107
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,880
and father to breed together um think

1108
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,559
about some of these poly hybrids who are

1109
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,039
responsible for

1110
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,960
um almost eradicating our history when

1111
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,199
it comes to that and lamb races and wild

1112
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,880
types are the history we can't just do

1113
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,960
away with them we can't just be excited

1114
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,680
uh off the off the lack of knowledge and

1115
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,079
just be excited off the names and the

1116
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,639
pictures and and you know um the hype uh

1117
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,000
and and then forget all about our

1118
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,639
responsibility and our history so we got

1119
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,719
to keep it around it's clear that you

1120
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,199
take an ethical approach when it comes

1121
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,358
to breeding and that's definitely one

1122
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,679
thing I admire from you and uh you know

1123
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,199
behind the scenes I we've had

1124
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,000
conversations through DMs and stuff

1125
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:33,879
where I'm firing off breeding questions

1126
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,400
on you and you know you're somewhat of a

1127
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:40,960
mentor towards me and really chill o OG

1128
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,480
the only cross I've ever done is uh

1129
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,039
somewhat influenced by you and your

1130
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,119
direction so I appreciate you amazing

1131
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,759
job too doing an amazing job man just

1132
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,960
keep going keep going take your time man

1133
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,240
don't don't you know realize what it is

1134
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,199
you want to do you want to go left you

1135
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,838
want to go right it's your choice you

1136
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,480
know and then you take your time and

1137
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,639
make that choice but uh you know it'll

1138
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,800
it'll it'll be something of a household

1139
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,920
name 15 years from now if you stick to

1140
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,920
it 20 years from there make it so that

1141
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,800
people remember it for for for good

1142
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,838
reasons and um for the guys that are

1143
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,119
just Chuck Chuck Chuck Chuck Chuck Chuck

1144
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,119
Chuck you'll never have a household name

1145
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,400
nobody will ever remember it man because

1146
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,920
you don't even remember it

1147
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,079
like who was that can remember the

1148
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,680
strain he created like last week because

1149
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,359
he creat so many but uh you know chilato

1150
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,440
G has the ability to to to be a legacy

1151
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:39,558
within our industry man so just keep

1152
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,240
chugging at it will do man will do so

1153
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,280
talking about the future what trends or

1154
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,959
Innovations in breeding are you most

1155
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,680
excited about and how do you see the

1156
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,720
future of breeding

1157
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:53,480
evolving that's a good question man I I

1158
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:57,279
I I hold this game to such a high

1159
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,440
pedestal um so a lot of times my my

1160
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,160
peers unless it's like my team or you

1161
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
know they don't really grasp the concept

1162
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:05,039
they don't see that far and um and I

1163
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,679
always tell people if you need to see

1164
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,920
where I'm looking at if you need to view

1165
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,399
things from My Lens then you have to

1166
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,480
step outside of our community our

1167
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,838
community is not okay it's not a place

1168
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,119
where they support education and they're

1169
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,078
going into the colleges hey learn this

1170
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:25,200
learn this about your community they're

1171
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,800
not doing that so but when it comes to

1172
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:31,598
um breeding dogs breeding daisies

1173
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,720
breeding corn breeding strawberries they

1174
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,400
are doing that that's where you learn

1175
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,279
the mechanics you need to step outside

1176
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,639
and I think that's that's the largest

1177
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,040
mistake of many of these um so-called

1178
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,440
breeders is that they start here as

1179
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,599
Growers and they think it's just that

1180
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,159
simple and then boom they don't realize

1181
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,000
that that education is not going to come

1182
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:53,399
from here because it's not here it

1183
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,920
breeding well breeding this plant is not

1184
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,440
a thing it's not a it's not a thing it's

1185
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,838
it's not even a real thing yet so we are

1186
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,440
so far ahead of time when it comes to

1187
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:07,039
our industry step outside of our

1188
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,679
industry learn the real mechanics and

1189
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,318
then prepare yourself for the future but

1190
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,279
uh to answer your question and not

1191
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,920
ramble on um I hold it to a high

1192
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,760
pedestal you can't take a pig to a pig

1193
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,599
competition without it being registered

1194
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,200
I need to know his registration number I

1195
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,480
need to know the name the father the

1196
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,679
mother the seven generation pedigree if

1197
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,079
it's going to be in this competition

1198
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:29,239
that's a pig I mean uh and and it should

1199
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,798
be the same for for what we do uh

1200
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:34,479
everything and all of these cups man I'm

1201
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:36,519
not even you can't even walk up and say

1202
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,079
you want to be inside this cup unless

1203
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:41,838
you have a a 20 generation pedigree

1204
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,640
going back to lambri that can show every

1205
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,639
mother father and ancestor in the

1206
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,358
lineage and if it's gaps in that

1207
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:49,118
ancestry then we can't consider you a

1208
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,159
pure bread we can't consider you a

1209
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,240
thorough bread we can't consider you a

1210
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:55,598
pure species we just can't because

1211
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,679
there's no proof of registration here I

1212
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,559
can't bring my dog matter how cool my

1213
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,000
dog looks it does back flips it can swim

1214
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,720
across the ocean it can do all these

1215
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,280
tricks but when I bring it to the dog

1216
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,959
show if it's not registered uh with a

1217
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,920
three generation pedigree on file then

1218
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,000
like n it can look like all the other

1219
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,639
Jack Russell teras but um it could

1220
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,599
outperform them all as well but they

1221
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,798
won't even take you serious if you don't

1222
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,838
have the proper registration paperwork

1223
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:23,798
and I think um that's where I want to

1224
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,000
see this place that's where it will be

1225
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:26,920
it's going to take legalization

1226
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
federally one day and it's going to take

1227
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,480
some genius coming out of high school or

1228
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,679
college to code some program that's

1229
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:38,000
identical to what they did over there as

1230
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:40,078
seed finder um if you ever uh you know

1231
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,199
familiar with that then they they have a

1232
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,240
database with the lineage and that is

1233
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:48,838
super important um from dogs to horses

1234
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:51,039
to pigs to corn to everything that we

1235
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:54,239
take seriously the fruits and vegetables

1236
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:57,159
you eat in the supermarket all require

1237
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:59,919
that lineage that documentation they all

1238
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,399
require it or it can't be bred within

1239
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,880
what we got going it's a mut you

1240
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,559
consider it a mut seeing that the how

1241
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,160
the industry is right now there are so

1242
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,599
many pollen Chuckers and people just

1243
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:11,920
creating random crosses and pushing it's

1244
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,079
hard for me to even visualize that far

1245
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,200
ahead and you're probably right it's

1246
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,200
just me being a general consumer small

1247
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,960
home grower it's like man imagine if we

1248
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,199
could get to that level to where like in

1249
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,159
order to enter a cup you have to show

1250
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:29,199
documentation like we're not there yet

1251
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:31,118
but that would be cool if it w right

1252
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,838
like that's that has to be the next

1253
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,400
level right because it's the norm with

1254
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,639
everything else yeah everything that's

1255
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,599
legal is the norm uh it nothing nothing

1256
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:44,199
we we eat nothing we consume nothing um

1257
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:48,160
none of the Liv stock animals pets none

1258
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:50,118
of those are considered pure unless it's

1259
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,639
registered with because that

1260
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:57,039
registration and those that pedigree um

1261
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:59,480
it gives you the ability

1262
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,239
to what we say uh what we consider

1263
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,880
confirmation it gives you the ability to

1264
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,798
conform to to to the breed standard so

1265
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,519
um if you have all your registration you

1266
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:10,239
have all your paperwork you have then I

1267
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:11,960
can take you seriously and look at your

1268
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,239
dog and then check them out and say the

1269
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,960
ears okay the oh the tail has a little

1270
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:19,000
Crook in it nope not breed standard it's

1271
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,079
not right so even if we pass that

1272
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,318
registration it's still that just gets

1273
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,760
you to the initial test of saying let's

1274
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:27,719
now let's look at your dog and see if

1275
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,480
it's a real pure dog uh it has all these

1276
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,798
champions in his bloodline and in his

1277
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,199
pedigree let's see if it's a champion as

1278
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:37,480
well um or if it's just uh a dog with

1279
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,118
paperwork that we don't consider um

1280
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,559
breed standard so same thing with with

1281
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:45,280
you know and and this it is hard to see

1282
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,119
because one thing we have to understand

1283
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,480
too um our industry and the guys that

1284
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,240
run our community that have been running

1285
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,199
the community big companies um pollen

1286
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:58,759
Chuckers whatever they have us

1287
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:01,639
desensitized to weak genetics um they

1288
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,359
have us desensitized to hermaphrodites

1289
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:06,239
