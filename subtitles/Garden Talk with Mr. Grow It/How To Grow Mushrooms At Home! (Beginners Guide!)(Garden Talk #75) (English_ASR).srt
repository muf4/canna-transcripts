1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,200
coming up on garden talk i typically

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,039
lean more towards liquid cultures just

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,519
because i can store them in my fridge

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,160
for quite a bit of time and slants or

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,919
even just in a in a jar actually popcorn

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,160
is one of my favorite go-to's just

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,039
because of availability it's very very

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,359
easy to find some organic popcorn and

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
you can boil that up and sterilize it

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
that is a really important factor you

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
want to make sure that you're just using

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,679
enough to saturate and mix between the

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
grains but not actually create puddles

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,119
anywhere

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,520
if you see any green i would just ditch

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,000
the jar don't even open it get your bag

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,239
whatever it is as it spreads very

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,238
aggressively don't get disheartened

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,839
you're gonna see a lot of contamination

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,159
but once you actually get to the

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
mushrooms it makes it all worthwhile and

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,839
you get some awesome food and some just

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
some nutrient dense goodness

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,558
what's up everybody if you that don't

25

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,719

about how to cultivate mushrooms so

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,759
really excited for this one but first

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
can you tell us a little bit about

109
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,079
yourself and kind of how you got into

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
gardening yeah definitely man uh so

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
pretty much since i was just a young kid

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
my family members my mom and grandma

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,439
have always had a pretty big plot garden

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,839
uh raised in the midwest where just

115
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,680
about everybody is related to a farmer

116
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,799
in some way shape or form

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,879
uh and it's very therapeutic for me uh

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
just quieting down in the garden and and

119
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,120
focusing so uh all that being able to

120
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,240
tie into a hobby that i could feed

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,079
myself

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
it was just bound to be it was like i

123
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,439
was made for it and then when did

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,199
mushrooms come in like how long have you

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,199
been cultivating them and what made you

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
get into them uh specifically about

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,639
seven years ago um

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,639
i was at a restaurant and i pretty much

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
really didn't like mushrooms that much

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,439
at the time

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,840
and i had a really awesome mushroom dish

132
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,279
and it was mostly oysters there was also

133
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,719
some shiitake

134
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,879
diced into it

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
but it was just really really good and

136
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
blew my mind because i thought i hated

137
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,519
mushrooms

138
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,439
and then once i

139
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,959
you know dived deeper in and seen how

140
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,000
many different mushroom options there

141
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,000
were i realized i was just eating gross

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,439
mushrooms rather than having really good

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,800
quality ones

144
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,399
uh then you know realize that it was a

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
plant and it was you know essentially

146
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,038
something that you could grow yourself

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
and uh

148
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,279
so then i went ahead and learned how to

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
grow it awesome and then what type of

150
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,799
mushrooms have you cultivated in the

151
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,719
past and what are some of your favorite

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
mushrooms to cultivate

153
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,120
i've done pretty much uh oysters

154
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,279
piopinis lions maine shiitakes

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
chestnuts trumpets

156
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,198
right now my favorite is the black pearl

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,519
king oyster it's a hybrid trumpet oyster

158
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
it's really really good it gets really

159
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,120
thick and meaty and you're able to

160
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,599
really do a lot of

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
meat uh like mock meat dishes with it

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,759
it's really really good nice nice i know

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
there are several different ways to

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
cultivate mushrooms it really depends on

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
the type that you are looking to

166
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,799
cultivate there are different tools and

167
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,000
equipment that you need to grow

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,439
mushrooms

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
what are some of the tools and equipment

170
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,719
that are needed talk about container

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,038
substrate light so on and so forth

172
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,960
yeah yeah so uh it's it's pretty uh

173
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,560
straightforward you'll need somewhere to

174
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,879
create spawn in

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,079
uh i.e like a bag or a jar something

176
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,918
like that

177
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,519
and then you'll also need a pressure

178
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,359
cooker that would be pretty important

179
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,799
that's for your sterilization and uh

180
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
pasteurization

181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
uh then you're also going to need

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,038
somewhere to actually grow the mushrooms

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,399
in like a fruiting chamber or a martha

184
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,959
tent or even a mono tub there's a lot of

185
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,879
different ways you can grow mushrooms i

186
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,680
have quite a few customers here at my

187
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,478
hydroponics store that use entire four

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,319
by four or ten by ten grow tents

189
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,719
to turn into a giant fruiting chamber

190
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,039
then past that you'll need

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
you know a lot a lot of isopropyl

192
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,079
alcohol that's probably the thing you're

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
going to go through the most

194
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,399
sterilization is key when growing

195
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,399
mushrooms

196
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,400
very small led light or a t5 fluorescent

197
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,359
or at a minimum even like a small rope

198
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,079
light

199
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
those work out really well

200
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,240
um

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
and then you're gonna need your

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
substrate itself uh i typically like to

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,399
roll towards masters mix

204
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,079
the masters mix is a 50 50 blend of uh

205
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,799
soy whole and uh oak so they take uh

206
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,198
pellets of the compressed oak and

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
pellets of the soy hole and mix it at a

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,680
50 50 rate and that's really what the

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,519
mushrooms these gourmet mushrooms really

210
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,639
want is a heavy

211
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,639
wood latent substrate gotcha and then

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,759
you can either start with

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
spore syringes or liquid cultures can

214
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,479
you talk to us about the differences

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
between those two maybe talk about the

216
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,598
pros and cons to each of them yeah

217
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,318
definitely

218
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,319
uh so they both have really good value

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
in mycology uh

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
typically your commercial

221
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,439
spore syringes will be a little more

222
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
broad

223
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,000
spectrum of uh spores inside of them

224
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
meaning that it's gonna be more than

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,959
just one uh fruiting body or mushroom

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,759
cap that the spores came from

227
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,000
meaning your gene pool will be very wide

228
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,479
in phenotypic expression

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you'll get you know big ones small ones

230
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,479
short fat ones you'll get all these

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,759
different sizes whereas

232
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,800
typically with a liquid culture it's

233
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,879
done from a specific mushroom if it if

234
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,759
that's how i like to do it you can get

235
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,679
multi-spored liquid cultures

236
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,919
they just tend to not grow as well than

237
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,519
a single single strain liquid culture

238
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,439
liquid culture is definitely a lot

239
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,879
faster because you're essentially

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,320
starting with

241
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,519
a liquid suspended mycelium rather than

242
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
the spores

243
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,839
which if you think of the spores

244
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
more like a seed

245
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,279
in layman's terms

246
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
that's what's going to grow the mycelium

247
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,120
and the mycelium would be considered

248
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,160
like the roots of the mushroom

249
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,320
so it's you're running with already

250
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,000
pre-germinated uh roots essentially

251
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,760
versus starting from spore which you

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
have to germinate and create that

253
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,039
mycelium so you just get a lot

254
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,000
faster colonization rate

255
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,439
and typically a lot less contamination

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
because those

257
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
commercial spore syringes

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,600
coming from multiple mushrooms there's a

259
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,958
lot more chance for contaminants to be

260
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
inside those four syringes

261
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
yeah both are really really good

262
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
i typically lean to

263
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
more towards

264
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,080
liquid cultures just because they i can

265
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,679
store them in my fridge for quite a bit

266
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,959
of time

267
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:59,278
in slants or even just in a in a jar

268
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,958
they really really work well for having

269
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,559
a lot of

270
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,719
mushroom seed on hand so to speak and

271
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,078
kind of keep them in my fridge a couple

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
different strains in there different

273
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,879
times and i can kind of rotate in and

274
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,720
out

275
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
that's uh pretty cool when you have the

276
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,759
liquid cultures whereas the spore

277
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,799
syringes

278
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,159
i think of it just like spores and water

279
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,519
uh

280
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,679
if you leave them in there too long they

281
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,000
can't germinate inside the syringe and

282
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,000
uh if there was a contaminant in there

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,078
those contaminants are gonna grow inside

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,039
your spores wrench

285
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,759
um

286
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,399
yeah uh most most cultivators though

287
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,319
tend to tend to lean towards the uh

288
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,958
liquid cultures for sure i actually have

289
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
one grow under my belt i ended up buying

290
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,838
a

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,439
kit so it has a kit with all the tools

292
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,519
and equipment in it

293
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
and from my understanding they sell the

294
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,078
spores separately so most of the time

295
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,120
you have to find a source for the spores

296
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,359
i actually started with the spore

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,679
syringe i've never done liquid culture

298
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
before so just the spore syringe and

299
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,599
then the kit together and i was able to

300
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
have everything i needed in order to to

301
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
completely grow first thing i remember

302
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
having to do is like they had

303
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,720
had the sport syringe and then it was

304
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,679
the inoculation so i had a it was a

305
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
mason jar and it came with corn kernels

306
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,239
in it

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,759
and and there was sealed up top and

308
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,919
there was a way for you to stick the

309
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,120
syringe in through the top and then

310
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,360
inoculate those corn kernels

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
what do you typically inoculate the

312
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
spores into

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
i actually popcorn is one of my favorite

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,879
go-to's just because of availability

315
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,240
it's very very easy to find some organic

316
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,320
popcorn and

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,278
you can boil that up and sterilize it

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,278
and use that another really common one

319
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,879
is uh rye grain berries uh another one a

320
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,559
couple of my friends like to just use

321
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,039
oats just just plain oats

322
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,000
millet's another really popular one uh

323
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,439
really

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,078
all depends on preference i find

325
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,160
uh and your technique

326
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,199
if you if you don't have a pressure

327
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,759
cooker uh you might only be able to use

328
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
uh millet or something like that

329
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,559
just because

330
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,000
the smaller seeds you don't have to get

331
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,159
as hot to

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,278
to sterilize

333
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,439
so

334
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,039
yeah yeah a couple different uh grain

335
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
options but just about any grain will

336
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,120
work if it has starch inside of it it's

337
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
a really good option

338
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,519
i would say availability would determine

339
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,120
which one you want to use but uh just

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,879
about anyone can go to the store and

341
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,799
pick up some popcorn and uh actually

342
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,799
works pretty well all right and then i

343
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,719
remember putting i think i put like

344
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,120
three milliliters

345
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,680
within that container size which had to

346
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
have been like a quart size mason jar

347
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,078
that was like probably halfway full of

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,000
the kernels put like three milliliters

349
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,759
in there is that pretty standard for all

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,240
types of mushrooms or does it really

351
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,559
depend on the the type the variety of

352
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
mushroom for how much spores you want to

353
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,000
put in there

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,800
so i would say it's more relative to how

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,759
much spawn you have inside the container

356
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,240
so if you had like a three pound bag you

357
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:10,000
know of spawn you would need anywhere

358
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,560
from five to even eight mils or cc's of

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
that uh spore syringe into it but these

360
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,039
smaller containers you can definitely do

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
you know one cc three cc's

362
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,159
but what you run into

363
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,759
uh with

364
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,879
with that could be an issue where you're

365
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,200
using too much of these uh

366
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,759
spore syringe and actually put too much

367
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
moisture into the jar

368
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,399
so

369
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
that is a really important factor you

370
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,480
want to make sure that you're just using

371
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,799
a enough to

372
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,879
saturate and mix between the grains but

373
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,879
not actually create puddles anywhere

374
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,000
that's good advice there and then like i

375
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,278
mentioned i don't have any experience

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
with the liquid cultures how would you

377
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,679
go about like the inoculation process

378
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
with the the liquid cultures

379
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,679
yeah so there's a couple different ways

380
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,360
you can do it my go-to way is just good

381
00:13:53,679 --> 00:14:00,559
old carro syrup uh just like corn syrup

382
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,159
uh the unflavored is the best uh lately

383
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,239
i've only been able to find like vanilla

384
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,159
flavored uh definitely try to get

385
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
unflavored corn syrup

386
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,000
or any uh carbohydrate will do well you

387
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,239
know you could use molasses if you

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,159
wanted uh some people will use cane

389
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,959
sugar coconut sugar

390
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,639
uh

391
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,838
coconut water

392
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,879
but i do prefer just water and uh some

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,120
carrot syrup uh and then what you do is

394
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,360
you'll uh cook that up to uh

395
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,879
sterilization temperatures

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,278
for about 15 minutes in your pressure

397
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,399
cooker about 15 psi

398
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,159
um

399
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,440
then once that's been sterilized you can

400
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,600
then let it cool down to room

401
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
temperature and then you will inoculate

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,278
your

403
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,799
spore syringe or your liquid culture

404
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,399
into the the broth that you've made

405
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,039
and then ideally you'll want to put it

406
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,000
on like a magnetic stirrer with a little

407
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,759
stirring uh device inside the jar but at

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
a minimum you can just hand stir it

409
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,799
maybe once or twice a day

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,320
and then after about 10 10 to about 20

411
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,879
days depending on the temperature of the

412
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
water you'll start to see that mycelium

413
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,078
grow in the jar

414
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,159
and then you can literally just pull it

415
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,319
up with a syringe and inoculate whatever

416
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,958
you like with it okay and then after

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,278
you've done the inoculation process into

418
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,078
your grain or whatever you're using what

419
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,519
conditions should that be

420
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,919
in you know is there a certain

421
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,919
temperature that yeah that should sit in

422
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,278
in order for growth to occur

423
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,799
yeah definitely your inoculation

424
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,159
temperature is going to be roughly

425
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,159
anywhere from about 75 74 all the way up

426
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,120
to about 82 degrees

427
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,439
warmer the faster but also

428
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,799
some contaminants do grow at warmer

429
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,600
temperatures

430
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:46,639
so i find that a little bit lower into

431
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,159
the 78 uh 77 range is really fine for me

432
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,278
and it really gives me a pretty

433
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:54,958
aggressive mycelium growth

434
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,559
but you'll go you know into

435
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,479
from your

436
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,359
jar let's say like you had in your kit

437
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,680
once that's been fully inoculated and

438
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,759
colonized and you see a lot of clean

439
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,120
white mycelium in there and then you

440
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,039
would dump that grain out in a

441
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,440
sterilized environment

442
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,799
i ideally like a in front of a laminar

443
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
flow hood

444
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,559
or

445
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,600
at a minimum like an upside down glove

446
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,919
box

447
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
which is just a box that you take you

448
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,759
cut some holes in the side of it so you

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,399
can reach your arms inside of it and it

450
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
gives you still air

451
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
and that still air will make it so

452
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,278
you're not getting a whole lot of

453
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,519
contaminants and you can spray a lot of

454
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,519
alcohol in there before you open up your

455
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
jar and then you'll pour that into your

456
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,198
substrate bag

457
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,879
uh or your substrate tub or whatever

458
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,958
you're growing in your your vessel

459
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,198
you're gonna fruit in yeah i used a grow

460
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,439
tent and kind of use that as the place

461
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,599
to sterilize so i had a little table

462
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
within a grow 10 and like use lysol and

463
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,120
wiped everything around with isopropyl

464
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,360
alcohol and just tried to sterilize it's

465
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,759
really important because it can go bad

466
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,320
right you can have uh you can completely

467
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,679
ruin everything if you don't sterilize

468
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,838
yeah and so that's super super important

469
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
i think i aimed for about 78 degrees

470
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,038
fahrenheit as i was aiming for and i got

471
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
some good growth

472
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,679
and uh in the court mason jar was about

473
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,759
i think it was about halfway full of the

474
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,079
kernels i think it took like

475
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,279
60 days maybe or something like that to

476
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,798
fully inoculate so what's the time frame

477
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,318
i mean i'm sure it's dependent on a few

478
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,720
different things but like how long

479
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,720
should it take to like fully inoculate

480
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,319
yeah so depending on what type of

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
mushroom it is is definitely going to

482
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,119
greatly affect the inoculate or the

483
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
colonization speed but typically most

484
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,479
gourmet mushrooms are going to be

485
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,399
anywhere from about 10 to about 30 days

486
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,839
and all those streams are going to fall

487
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,798
right inside of there some of uh

488
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:54,159
other mushrooms might take uh

489
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,798
anywhere from about 14 to seven days uh

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,038
for full colonization depending on grain

491
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,839
as well like the popcorn we were talking

492
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,679
about one of its caveats is it tends to

493
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,918
colonize a little bit slower just

494
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,559
because it has a harder outer shell and

495
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,360
its surface areas a little bit greater

496
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,839
versus like your millet which very very

497
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,359
small seed kind of like bird seed if you

498
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,119
if you've ever had a bird before it's

499
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,399
the really really small seed in that

500
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
seed mix

501
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,038
uh and that seed being very small uh

502
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,798
will be taken over by that mycelium very

503
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,319
quick and it'll penetrate into the seed

504
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,759
and consume it

505
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,359
all right and then after they have

506
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,599
inoculated

507
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,079
what should they look out for like each

508
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,079
day you know what are there signs of of

509
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,599
good growth happening and what signs of

510
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,399
bad growth happening

511
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,798
yeah so uh you'll see the the mycelium

512
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
uh start growing and from wherever it

513
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,480
does grow it almost seems like it's a

514
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,640
random point in the jar that'll start

515
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,200
growing but from there it'll kind of

516
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,160
nucleate outwards from these points

517
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,080
you'll have

518
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,640
you know multiple points inside the jar

519
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,599
which will have this spherical or

520
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,600
cylindrical growth rate away from it

521
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,319
and you want to see a nice run of that

522
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,399
mycelium daily you might some mycelium

523
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,399
you might see inches some you might see

524
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,480
centimeters

525
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
but what you want to see is that even

526
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,798
growth rate and stretching and consuming

527
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,959
those grains and what you want to look

528
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,119
out for is contaminants

529
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,400
anything that is in a really nice white

530
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,239
healthy

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
clean looking mycelium

532
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,839
is going to be considered a contaminant

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
unless it's a metabolite

534
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,079
metabolites are kind of an amber

535
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,120
brownish liquid

536
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:36,159
uh consider those guys like a waste of

537
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,479
the mycelium it's going to be uh

538
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,440
in layman's terms mushroom poop and pee

539
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,000
it's uh it consumes uh the food source

540
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,038
and uh releases that uh that exudate of

541
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,599
metabolite and uh it's actually uh

542
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,279
antiseptic i believe uh so it's uh

543
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:55,038
pretty sterile on itself at nature

544
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,119
but the contaminants that you're going

545
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,480
to want to look for are mostly

546
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,399
trichoderma

547
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,519
either that or cobweb mold

548
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
trichoderma is going to be a very very

549
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,918
green mold

550
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
also

551
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,799
parts of it can be gray and even white

552
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
but green is really the main thing

553
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,079
you're going to want to look out for if

554
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,480
you see any green

555
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,119
i would just ditch the jar don't even

556
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,159
open it get your bag whatever it is as

557
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,558
it spreads very aggressively and it can

558
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
sporulate inside your grow space and be

559
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,480
very hard to get out but yeah just

560
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,558
really looking for those uh small

561
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,839
growths in mycelium and checking for

562
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,038
contaminants

563
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,599
uh and

564
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,079
patience what about blue mold is that a

565
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,240
thing uh blue mold

566
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,038
like growing on the mycelium itself or

567
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,519
on the actual food yeah i mean you see

568
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,679
that often like with the compost for

569
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,679
example if you're composting and this is

570
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
like a blue type of mold that occurs is

571
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,159
that that ever happened on the mushroom

572
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,399
side of things when you're growing

573
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,320
mushrooms or no there's hundreds of blue

574
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
molds but a lot of

575
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,678
blue is typically

576
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
uh bruising of a particular type of

577
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,320
mycelium

578
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,639
usually active mushrooms will have a

579
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,678
bluish hue there are a lot of other

580
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,360
mushrooms that have the same bluish

581
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,720
bruising to it

582
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,240
but the most common ones are active

583
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,798
mushrooms there are definitely blue

584
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,960
molds not super common inside grains

585
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,119
though you'll see more green

586
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,798
molds pink molds

587
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,439
you'll also see

588
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,918
very very common is bacillus

589
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
or wet spot is what it's considered in

590
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,400
the mycelium world

591
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,519
and that looks very very like brown and

592
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,159
slimy uh just looks very gross

593
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,720
uh almost like snot and brown is growing

594
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,720
on your uh your grains there and once

595
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,038
that happens that's another you know i'd

596
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,960
consider that just toss it out

597
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,119
one thing with with mushroom growing and

598
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,159
mycology if you're getting into it

599
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,839
don't be disheartened by failure or

600
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,919
contamination i wouldn't even consider

601
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,079
contamination a failure

602
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,159
i would consider that a learning point

603
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,279
you know most contamination

604
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,840
can be tracked back to poor technique

605
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,558
uh and what i mean by that is like your

606
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,119
sterilization process or how much did

607
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,918
you use iso did you clean your tools in

608
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:21,038
between transfers uh did you make sure

609
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
your room was sterilized or even worse

610
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,480
was the

611
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,359
culture you were using contaminated from

612
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,400
the beginning so there's going to be

613
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,359
quite a few failures and

614
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
complete loss i've lost whole

615
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,439
growth tents just full of

616
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,359
gourmet mushrooms

617
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,080
due to quite a few different things and

618
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,240
it just happens happens to everyone

619
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,480
so don't get disheartened you're going

620
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,400
to see a lot of contamination but once

621
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
you actually get to the mushrooms it

622
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,798
makes it all worthwhile and you get some

623
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,960
awesome food and some

624
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,240
just some nutrient-dense goodness

625
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,480
that makes sense

626
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
so let's say the person is successful

627
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,240
right and they they fully inoculated

628
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,079
their jar or their grain is fully

629
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,000
inoculated they're ready to change over

630
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,720
to the substrate

631
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,798
what do you use for a substrate i

632
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,558
particularly like to use masters mix for

633
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,000
the gourmet mushrooms

634
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,319
which is that 50 50 blend of the oak and

635
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,919
soy hole pellets

636
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,519
but a lot of

637
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,360
saffrophilic mushrooms which are

638
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,839
mushrooms that

639
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,759
eat decaying waste and matter

640
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,359
and those types of mushrooms really like

641
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,400
to grow on

642
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:35,678
a multitude of different substrates most

643
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,400
common vermiculite and coconut uh

644
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,519
coir mixed together with some sort of

645
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,919
manure or even a worm casting

646
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,839
but for the gourmet mushrooms

647
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,720
it is most common

648
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,759
a

649
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,679
oat or a hole of some kind with a heavy

650
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,919
amount of wood and there's lots of

651
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,559
different blends but i particularly like

652
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,919
the masters mix from mushroom media

653
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,599
online

654
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
really really awesome stuff i'm actually

655
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,719
working on getting it in my store

656
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,558
but

657
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
you can take a couple scoops to the

658
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,359
desired amount of weight you want to

659
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,919
have and add x amount of water

660
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,759
and you have all the substrate you need

661
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
pretty cool stuff nice i have to check

662
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,640
out that blend sounds like a good one oh

663
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,240
yeah the one that i used i have it right

664
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,120
here it's a two pound bag pasteurized it

665
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,759
was dehydrated elephant and horse manure

666
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,599
vermiculite and gypsum does that sound

667
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,919
like a pretty decent substrate is there

668
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,038
anything that worthy of calling out

669
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,880
there that maybe be a pro or a con not

670
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,759
necessarily that all seems pretty all

671
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
right other than it being elephant uh

672
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,960
and i'm certain that's a great you know

673
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,480
dung source

674
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,240
i would only consider like its

675
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
availability i think it might be a

676
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,960
little hard to get elephant poop on the

677
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,720
regular unless you live by a zoo

678
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,319
and the zoo you know was willing to give

679
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
it away then definitely go for that

680
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,480
stuff

681
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,919
but with any poop or manure or dung you

682
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,000
want to make sure that it's properly

683
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,320
composted and aged

684
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,159
because with a lot of comp or a lot of

685
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,000
dung and manure if it isn't properly

686
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,880
composted and aged

687
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,679
it can pass on salmonella

688
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
quite a few other food borne illnesses

689
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,559
so you want to really make sure that

690
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,320
you're getting manure from

691
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,240
a farmer who knows what he's doing and

692
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,480
has aged his product properly and

693
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,919
contaminants will come too so

694
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
good to know yeah that's really good to

695
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
know okay so at what point do you

696
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
actually

697
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
transfer what you've inoculated to the

698
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
substrate and how do you do it and feel

699
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,440
free to break it down in details you

700
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,199
know what i mean even down to the nitty

701
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
gritty details of putting on the gloves

702
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
to make sure

703
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
that uh you know everything's clean and

704
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,720
sterile and all that stuff okay well

705
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,120
i'll start by saying uh i'll get the

706
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,640
repetitive part out just in between

707
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,359
every step insert the step where you

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,360
spray down all the surfaces your hands

709
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,158
your tools and everything

710
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:01,038
with isopropyl alcohol unless you are

711
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
using a alcohol flame for needle

712
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,839
sterilization

713
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,798
then you do not want to be spraying

714
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,558
alcohol

715
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,240
because then it's flammable and that

716
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,599
will that won't turn out well

717
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,759
but insert

718
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,759
alcohol sprays everywhere

719
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,558
but you'll definitely want to glove up

720
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,798
a glove box if you don't have a laminar

721
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,639
flow hood uh and we'll just go with the

722
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,319
glove box option because not everybody

723
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,360
has a laminar flow hood they're pretty

724
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,439
big and pricey and bulky but just about

725
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,678
everyone can make a glove box so you're

726
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,679
going to take the top of your glove box

727
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,278
off and you're going to put all of your

728
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,320
work inside of it

729
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,798
and then you're going to close your

730
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:40,158
glove box and by work i mean all of your

731
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,158
petri dishes or spore syringes or your

732
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,039
bags or tubs or whatever you're working

733
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,559
on inside this clean space

734
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,919
spray with alcohol you might have forgot

735
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,678
already

736
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,400
then we're going to

737
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
open our mycelium or our spawn or

738
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,798
whatever we're using

739
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,519
inside the sterile environment and dump

740
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,440
it into the substrate mix now your

741
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,200
substrate mix might be in a big tub it

742
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,840
might be in a box

743
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,840
it might be in a small

744
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,639
bag mix it up inside of there you can

745
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,959
get very large glove boxes like

746
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,960
i think they're about like 32 or so

747
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,120
gallons the big rubber made totes with

748
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,640
they're all clear plastic i recommend

749
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,158
the largest one you can find that way

750
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,240
you have a very large workspace and

751
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,080
you're not confined to this little shoe

752
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,880
box

753
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,119
um

754
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
but yeah uh sterilized sterilized

755
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,918
sterilized

756
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,480
and then you're gonna actually pull that

757
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,640
mycelium out and place it into your

758
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,880
substrate break it up really fine and

759
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,440
mix it thoroughly into it

760
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,360
and then you're going to cover your

761
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,038
inoculated substrate

762
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,119
from the light and you're also going to

763
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,000
want to seal the co2 in so if you have

764
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,239
any

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,519
breathing ports on the side of your mono

766
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,319
tub or

767
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,480
a

768
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,158
filter patch on the side of your

769
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,159
mushroom bag there's a certain way you

770
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,640
can fold that patch over so it's not

771
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,799
just dumping out all the co2 and then

772
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,679
the mono tubs you can just put tape on

773
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,319
your

774
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,720
side holes on the mono tube there

775
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,879
to trap that co2 in and then you're

776
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,159
going to let it sit for about 10 to

777
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
about 30 days for that substrate to

778
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,600
fully colonize

779
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,359
just like our little jar did it'll

780
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,719
completely turn nice and white like a

781
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,959
big old brick

782
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,919
and then once we get to there

783
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,679
we can start going into our fruiting

784
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,520
initiation you mentioned clear tub

785
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
now i actually use a clear tub as well

786
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,000
it's like a i want to say it's probably

787
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:37,439
maybe 18 inches long by maybe about 10

788
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,960
inches wide so it's a height maybe uh

789
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,558
maybe a foot tall right it's a real

790
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
small tub it's you know i'm just going

791
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,200
personally for myself but

792
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,038
one thing that i was advised was to use

793
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,038
like i have like a clear like a black

794
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,519
plastic liner that you know you

795
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:54,798
sterilize and then put in there

796
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,240
and that helps with uh helps reduce

797
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,599
i'm terrible with the terminology i

798
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,038
don't know if it's called pinning or

799
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,519
something like that but basically these

800
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,519
it'll start to fruit underneath

801
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,079
the whole substrate kind of come off the

802
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,798
sides and just not like fruit naturally

803
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,879
out from the top do you recommend uh

804
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,240
doing something like that or i mean you

805
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,399
mentioned clear containers black

806
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
container would that prevent that from

807
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,639
happening uh yeah so if you went ahead

808
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,799
and like let's say that tote you have

809
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,799
where you normally put your uh your

810
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,599
plastic if you went and painted that

811
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,519
same length black or even covered it

812
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,398
with black tape that would effectively

813
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,639
do the same thing but i actually prefer

814
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,839
that plastic bag a little bit better

815
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
because you'll

816
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,720
sometimes get separation from your

817
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,199
mycelium block off of the side of the

818
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,759
plastic wall and the bag will actually

819
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,679
grab that mycelium block and really help

820
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,440
with moisture retention

821
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
and prevent that side pinning you're

822
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
talking about where you got those pesky

823
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
little mushrooms on the side that

824
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,480
you just can't get to or it's a pain to

825
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,759
get to them

826
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,159
and they just they're just not

827
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,759
aesthetically pleasing okay that's good

828
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,840
good tips there so you mentioned it's

829
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,319
going to take you know roughly 10 days

830
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,558
maybe even longer for

831
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,000
that substrate to be kind of completely

832
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,918
inoculated red is going to turn out to

833
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,759
be this white brick when do you

834
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,679
introduce light

835
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,759
you know what light should be added and

836
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,159
when should you add it

837
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,798
so you really don't need any light until

838
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,919
you're ready to fruit the mycelium block

839
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,759
or brick and that light really you don't

840
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,399
need a whole lot of it a lot of

841
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,158
misconception about lights and mushrooms

842
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,798
is that you need this big old powerful

843
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,799
light when you really all you need is

844
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,720
enough light to direct the mushrooms

845
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:42,798
which way to grow you know if you had a

846
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,440
150 watt led light versus you know a 50

847
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,720
watt t5 led light you're not going to

848
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
grow more mushrooms with the bigger

849
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,240
light

850
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,960
the the smaller light will do just fine

851
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,679
and almost the same exact job so i tend

852
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,840
to go with the really low dose low end

853
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
of the spectrum with your lights

854
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,599
uh literally a desk lamp if that's all

855
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,079
you have you can utilize that and

856
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,839
that'll be more than enough

857
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,599
rope lights are pretty efficient as well

858
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,678
at that

859
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,278
but don't need a whole lot of light and

860
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,640
then it's going to be a 12 hour cycle

861
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,240
very similar to most fruiting and

862
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,840
flowering plants

863
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,839
and that will

864
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,319
that mixed with fresh air exchange

865
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,199
which is going to be your co2 and fresh

866
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,240
air transfer from your actual fruiting

867
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
chamber

868
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,359
that with the 12 hour light cycle will

869
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,960
initiate your fruiting

870
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,199
fruiting conditions

871
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,440
okay so for the first two weeks or so

872
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,558
you are going to be under no light at

873
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,399
all and then once you add the light 12

874
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,079
hour light cycle that's when it's going

875
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,759
to start to fruit and you said there

876
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,119
should be exchange happening can you

877
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,278
talk a little bit more in detail about

878
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,359
the actual exchange that happens as far

879
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,679
as air the co2

880
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,839
yeah so you want to have a fresh air

881
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,640
exchange and and what that means is you

882
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,240
want to expel the co2 out of the grow

883
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,399
chamber or the fruiting chamber or

884
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,798
wherever you're fruiting at

885
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,678
because the mycelium will continually

886
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:10,000
make and produce co2 and if there's too

887
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,880
much co2 prevalent you'll get really

888
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,640
tall and leggy and stretchy mushrooms

889
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
that sometimes can't even stand up on

890
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,759
their own and they just look really

891
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,519
misshapen

892
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,079
and it's hard to get a nice good even

893
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,240
canopy flush of mushrooms

894
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,839
or even just get your mushrooms to get a

895
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,640
good yield off on

896
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,240
so

897
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
a couple different things you can do for

898
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,480
your fresh air exchange is if you're in

899
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,200
a mono tub which most most people

900
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,200
growing uh saphrophilic mushrooms are in

901
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,600
a mono tub

902
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
you'll have your holes on the side of it

903
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,278
typically

904
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,679
two on each side so right above your

905
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,440
soil line about three to six inches

906
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
above where your your substrate line

907
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,919
will be is where you'll want these holes

908
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,840
and then you want to think of co2

909
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,360
like water the way it fills up the rooms

910
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,959
it's going to fill from the bottom up

911
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,719
it's heavier than air

912
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,679
so you'll place your

913
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
holes

914
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
right above where your canopy would be

915
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,960
for your mushrooms so that way it'll

916
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
flow out

917
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,880
and then the fresh air exchange will be

918
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,519
going through

919
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,120
a little piece of polyfill or a filter

920
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,679
patch at 0.2 or 0.5 micron

921
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,278
i prefer the poly fill which is uh

922
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,360
really just the stuff you find inside

923
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,558
pillows you can get it at craft stores

924
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,398
and

925
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,599
join fabrics and all kinds of places

926
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,959
like that

927
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,240
uh

928
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
yeah you just pop that inside of the

929
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,480
hole so all the air going through is

930
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
filtered no contaminants are making it

931
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,319
through there

932
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,079
nothing but co2 and oxygen

933
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,119
and then another little step you can do

934
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:44,720
is open your uh tote daily and fan it

935
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,319
out but that typically will lead to and

936
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,679
you opening the door to more

937
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,398
contaminants

938
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,200
so i tend to not fan as much and try to

939
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:56,479
focus on having a proper fresh air

940
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,319
exchange with the holes placed properly

941
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,079
on the tub so that way it doesn't allow

942
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,240
the tub to fill up to

943
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,398
a really high level of co2

944
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,079
and like a an exhaust span on your tent

945
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,678
will help as well if you haven't you're

946
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,398
inside of one of those tents

947
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,918
uh fresh air exhausting out gotcha and

948
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,799
then mushrooms will start to grow you

949
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,799
can clearly see them at what point do

950
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
you harvest those mushrooms

951
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,839
yeah so depending on what kind of

952
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,039
mushroom it is uh if it's a gilled

953
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:24,078
mushroom or

954
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,639
i'm going to try to stick with more

955
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,519
layman's terms or like a polypore

956
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,679
mushroom which one has

957
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,759
gills and one doesn't if you're growing

958
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,960
the type of mushroom that has gills

959
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,520
you're going to want to wait for that

960
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,199
veil to break off and the veil is right

961
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,440
below the cap

962
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,279
and it's like this almost like a skirt

963
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,440
that connects completely around the edge

964
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,519
of the cap to the bottom of the stem and

965
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,000
as that mushroom opens up kind of like a

966
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,320
umbrella would it tends to pop that

967
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,239
little veil that connects and then that

968
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,359
mushroom pops open you can see those

969
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,519
gills

970
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,559
typically you'll want to get it right as

971
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,639
or right before that veil is bursting

972
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,559
and that's perfect time to harvest and

973
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,639
if you're growing poly pores

974
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,519
or oyster mushrooms or anything like

975
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,199
that

976
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,400
you'll want to wait until

977
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,039
the mushroom has opened up and the

978
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,519
bottom of it goes from curling down

979
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,519
towards where your stem is from curling

980
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,719
up it'll kind of it'll kind of look like

981
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,159
the bottom

982
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,078
it's a hard way explain like if you've

983
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,639
ever seen a blue whale where it holds

984
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,079
its neck up it has those big grates on

985
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,759
on its neck

986
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,400
you'll see that and it's almost like the

987
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,160
whale tilts its head up after looking

988
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,039
down it's really what it looks like to

989
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,559
me

990
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,920
and that's when your oyster mushrooms

991
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,039
are ready to go

992
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,559
but typically before they drop spores

993
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,960
if they're dropping spores really

994
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,199
heavily you've kind of went a little bit

995
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
past that window of when it's perfect

996
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,598
harvest

997
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,479
yeah the one i had this the veils opened

998
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,760
up and spores were released and i know

999
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,240
if you are

1000
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,320
looking to do multiple flushes

1001
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,239
basically if your spo if the veil opens

1002
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,400
up and the spores get released it kind

1003
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,919
of prevents more fruiting from happening

1004
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,480
if i'm not mistaken and so like

1005
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,240
i was always told harvest right before

1006
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
the veil actually opens up to prevent

1007
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,358
the spores from actually kind of getting

1008
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,639
all over the rest of the substrate and

1009
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,759
preventing those that fruiting from

1010
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,358
happening

1011
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,920
yeah definitely

1012
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,159
those spores once they dump

1013
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,519
if they're left there for long they can

1014
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,279
start to contaminate uh you'll also

1015
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,838
start to get new mycelium growing

1016
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,880
because it is a a new mushroom

1017
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,960
essentially uh so those new mushrooms

1018
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,880
growing on top of that old mycelium you

1019
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,720
might have a clash

1020
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,680
where definitely it would it would halt

1021
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:46,719
that that fruiting and kind of shift its

1022
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,598
gear over to i'm being attacked by this

1023
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,919
this outside external mushroom

1024
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,280
uh and switch from its fruiting and yeah

1025
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,200
you get some really weird stuff

1026
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,280
happening and so when you go to actually

1027
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,960
pick the mushrooms what's your preferred

1028
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,320
technique i mean are you just going down

1029
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,159
there with your hand and kind of

1030
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,000
pinching it at the bottom and twisting

1031
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,440
and pulling off or using you know

1032
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,280
trimmers to kind of get in there and

1033
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,280
prune at the very bottom of the base of

1034
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,920
the mushroom or how do you do it yeah so

1035
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
if i'm growing in a monotube i prefer to

1036
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,039
actually grab that little piece of

1037
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,839
plastic you were talking about and

1038
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,559
actually pull the whole block out of the

1039
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,000
tub and place it on a big old table and

1040
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,039
i'll just take a pair of scissors and

1041
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,320
right above the mycelium line just cut

1042
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,480
like you would you're trimming the grass

1043
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
or something cut all those down as low

1044
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,519
as you can as close as you can

1045
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,279
and then for those wood-loving mushrooms

1046
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,280
most of the gourmets

1047
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
i actually do those by hand and you just

1048
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,680
kind of place your hand right up

1049
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,159
underneath where the mycelium and the

1050
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,919
fruiting body reach each other and then

1051
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,598
you just kind of kind of jostle it left

1052
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
to right and it'll just kind of pop

1053
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,760
right off the whole mushroom and that's

1054
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,960
how i like to do those ones and then

1055
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,560
after you pick the mushrooms a lot of

1056
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,079
people they'll do is they'll dry it i

1057
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,279
know it depends on the variety and so on

1058
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,200
and so forth but

1059
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,800
talk to us about like the drying process

1060
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,639
how long does that take do you just lay

1061
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,920
it out on a paper towel for example or

1062
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,598
should you be

1063
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,800
doing something else with it

1064
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,160
yeah there's a bunch of different ways

1065
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,800
you can do it

1066
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,719
i prefer the the dehydrator method it's

1067
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,560
very quick and efficient

1068
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,639
you'll set your dehydrator on on the

1069
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,799
lowest setting some of them nowadays

1070
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,559
even have a mushroom setting or

1071
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,480
a nuts and fruits and berries whatever

1072
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,078
the lowest temperature is

1073
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,320
and then that could take anywhere from a

1074
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,079
day to two days depending on how big the

1075
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,640
mushroom is

1076
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,839
or you can also air dry them just like

1077
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,960
you would any other herbs or plants

1078
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,279
um

1079
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,079
let's say if you've ever done like basil

1080
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,560
or oregano or thyme uh you get some of

1081
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,880
those large drying nets and you can just

1082
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,279
lay them out on the nets

1083
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,920
for about 7 days sometimes 14 days

1084
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,440
depending on the humidity and the

1085
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,000
temperature in the room yeah yeah pretty

1086
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,800
straightforward stuff but you will

1087
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,358
definitely lose about 80 sometimes 90

1088
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,519
percent of your mushroom weight to water

1089
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,799
so when you when you're drying out and

1090
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,759
you got this big hefty crazy full net

1091
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,440
you come back in 10 to 14 days and it's

1092
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,680
it's light and fluffy

1093
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,679
it's like styrofoam almost makes sense

1094
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,519
yeah there's some medicinal plants that

1095
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,118
are grown and when they do the drying

1096
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,199
process they lose about the same amount

1097
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,960
of weight right like 75 80 percent of

1098
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,118
the weight is actually water weight to

1099
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,720
begin so you know they'll dry it and

1100
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,119
then they'll they'll weigh it after the

1101
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,039
fact and and see all the the damage that

1102
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,800
has been done as far as like the amount

1103
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,480
of moisture that has been lost there but

1104
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,240
uh yeah very similar there i was gonna

1105
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,119
say uh once they're dry

1106
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:40,479
uh as long as they're stored in a you

1107
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,559
know airtight container uh

1108
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,079
i would say indefinitely they're they're

1109
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:48,480
pretty much good and definitely as long

1110
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,480
as they're not re-uh hydrated uh

1111
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,679
you can really really long-term store

1112
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,240
some mushrooms as long as they're

1113
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,960
properly dried and uh stored in an

1114
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,118
airtight container okay so we were like

1115
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,039
a traditional plastic baggie you know

1116
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,559
sandwich bag you would avoid that all

1117
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,000
together huh

1118
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,199
i wouldn't yeah i would avoid the

1119
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,880
plastic bags uh unless you're

1120
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,358
you might be able to do

1121
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,960
like a skunk bag or like a grove bag but

1122
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,440
i wouldn't do like a sandwich bag you'd

1123
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,679
want it to be specifically uh or like a

1124
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
food service mylar bag

1125
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,118
you could definitely do one of those or

1126
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,160
like a glass or steel

1127
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,079
receptacle like a c-vault or a big glass

1128
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,838
mason jar or something like that all

1129
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,240
right cool

1130
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,000
so i have lots of beginners tuning into

1131
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,559
this podcast and i'm sure there's some

1132
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,079
people that are either just starting

1133
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,639
growing mushrooms or they're about to

1134
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,160
start growing mushrooms taking a step

1135
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,318
back and

1136
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,318
looking at the entire process what

1137
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,639
advice do you have for someone who's new

1138
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,440
to growing mushrooms um it might sound

1139
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,318
cliche but you know have fun with it it

1140
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,240
is a hobby at the end of the day and

1141
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,679
hobbies should be fun you know you

1142
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,199
should be having fun while you're

1143
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,799
learning this

1144
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,399
and then i'll take it back to what i

1145
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,680
said earlier where

1146
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,800
uh contaminants are mostly in my opinion

1147
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,239
from just a poor technique uh so all

1148
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,079
that means is you might have just did

1149
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,078
something wrong and that means you can

1150
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,280
go back and fix it and do it right the

1151
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,359
next time

1152
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,319
so don't be disheartened

1153
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,400
from failure and have lots of fun

1154
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,159
and then my final one would be

1155
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
kind of what you did as i'd recommend to

1156
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,598
start with a kit

1157
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,200
if you're really on the fence about it

1158
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,079
there's a lot of companies that sell

1159
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,199
kits

1160
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,000
my company included

1161
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,759
htgsupply.com we have quite a few

1162
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,318
different little mushroom starter kits

1163
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,880
on there they're mostly just substrate

1164
