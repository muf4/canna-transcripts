culture or or growing or anything like

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,039
that um rather of it is DIY I learn and

97
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,080
do a lot of research between what I know

98
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,840
and how I can apply it so a lot of

99
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,360
experience from work not to mention I I

100

110
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,399
mean like I mentioned um uh a lot of my

111
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,679
DIY goes into my my experience through

116
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,120

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,240
gardening I guess I really started

128
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,839
gardening when I first purchased my home

129
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,639

wife and we have a lot of you know

131
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,120
backyard space to do so uh we have

136
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,638
growing them herself I have a Mand tree

137
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,399
I'm trying to grow a lemon tree so I can

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,199
have the necessity you know every

139
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,679
everyone's backyard kind of dream for

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,840
that same reason and then I have my my

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
seasonal medicinal plan that's outside

142
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,719
for the most part it's kind of

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
derivative of my indoor stuff that I

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,880
have and I push it out there when

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
season's right and now what would you

146
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,639
say is your overall style of gardening

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,039
are you indoor outdoor Organics

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,439
synthetics soil cocoa what's your style

149
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,519
uh well I would imagine my my style of

150
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,279
gardening would pertain mostly to endoor

151
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,478
Hydroponics um where I use different

152
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,918
methods of growing for different growth

153
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:49,879
stages uh you I use Co I use cocoa Rock

154
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,639
W hydren I also use synthetic Blends um

155
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,439
especially since you're it's a

156
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,240
hydroponic system it needs to be clean

157
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,160
you can't have too many builds up algae

158
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,199
or film and you know causing the flow to

159
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,400
stop one way or the other um I I work a

160
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,800
lot with uh recirculating system so I I

161
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,519
need the flow to be constant and

162
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,199
consistent uh let me see here um I'm I'm

163
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,799
trying to maintain a Perpetual grow so I

164
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,319

I have like my seedlings my my cuts my

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
fresh cuts I have on one side and when

167
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,519
they're rooted enough and big enough to

168
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:29,198
move to the to my bigger 10 or my my

169
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,959
next 10 over and I have my end stages of

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,639
like vegetation and and flowering at the

171
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,120
end of in there at least and repeat the

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,439
process of the take cuts that I need and

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,680
get tired of the the C ofari kind of go

174
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,839
on the search for another mother you

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,959
know so mostly Hydroponics indoors

176
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,239
perfect that's exactly what we're

177
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,560
talking about today and I know you like

178
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,519
to get into the DIY side of things you

179
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,000
built your own dwc system let's break it

180
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,680
down a little bit for the beginners

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,120
first some people not might not know

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,000
what dwc is or also are DW can you

183
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,519
explain what both of those things are

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,519
well um dwc or you know deep water

185
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,318
culture more or less a form of

186
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,038
hydroponic similar to like I don't know

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,280
if you're I know you're familiar with

188
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:15,079
the crackie method the you know simple

189
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,918
thing is like having a jar and you know

190
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,198
roots are hanging into the water and it

191
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,120
kind of depletes the nutrients as it

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,199
grows um I think water culture is more

193
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,478
passive uh or less passive for that same

194
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,639
reason it requires that you you

195
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,598
implicate oxygen so we can add uh add to

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,759
the roots for that same reason and you

197
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,878
know that's kind of the difference

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,080
between overwatering your plants and

199
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,199
underwatering them it's definitely

200
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,399
capable of doing so within water culture

201
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,199
as well um in a nutshell the plant is

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,359
suspended in a neutral like medium with

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
its roots mostly hanging out the

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
container uh to take the nutrient water

205
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,680
up and at the same time you have like I

206
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,318
mentioned some oxygen um being air rated

207
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,079
up from maybe

208
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,280
a like a AirStone or depending on how

209
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,680
big you have setup it's to drill some

210
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,239
micro bubbles up there and and keep the

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,079
keep the auction going keeping the plant

212
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,240
healthy and keeping it some some air to

213
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:15,758
breathe and theni to maybe a uh rdwc of

214
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,199
recycling the water culture um in my

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,960
let's say uh situation I have like a

216
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,840
kind of three three plant uh setup where

217
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,000
I have all the buckets kind of

218
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,318
interconnected with uh PVC tubing

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,918
that'll give it a nice flow between all

220
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,038
all the same water flowing between the

221
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,478
three plants it'll make it so I don't

222
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,278
have to refill or maintain individually

223
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,599
those plants those same plants um and to

224
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,158
be honest like you know when you're

225
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,320
doing like a deep water culture or like

226
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,958
you know something that's all connected

227
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
you want to kind of keep to the same

228
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,119
kind of like plant or

229
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,000
cultivar just so it doesn't get too

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,679
you're not too too different uh in grow

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,078
growth rate or like things you have to

232
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:00,759
kind of like uh like let's say maybe

233
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,559
manipulate the the different nutrients

234
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,759
that you have for plant so some some

235
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,039
plants like uh they're they're very

236
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,200
temperamental you know this and

237
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,480
depending on where they come from they

238
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,519
have different uh let's say means to

239
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,278
uptake nutrients I mean for the most

240
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,320
part the two biggest differences between

241
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,720
the deep water culture and you know

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,560
recycling is is the the passing of the

243
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,600
water between the tubes and it can be

244
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,159
anywhere from you know simple like uh

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,040
vinyl tubing or you can go PVC tubing I

246
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,759
mean nice and setups where they

247
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:37,159
anywhere from in inch stick to uh pipes

248
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,838
to like 3 in so um you can go anywhere

249
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,399
from there to be honest it's not the

250
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,560
biggest difference if you have a smaller

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,278
setup but the the higher flow would be

252
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,719
kind of will circulate a lot of the

253
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,838
nutrients and keep it like not idle it

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
won't be sitting there and kind of like

255
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,360
building up film or anything of the sort

256
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
and that's us the case with like deep

257
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,120
water culture usually the water is like

258
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,679
fluctuating a lot got it and so arguably

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,959
our dwc is a little bit easier for the

260
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,519
regions you mentioned uh there's a you

261
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,479
know Reservoir and things are

262
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
recirculating through multiple plants

263
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,320
and you really just have that one

264
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,199
control versus dwc kind of like

265
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,079
individual buckets right and you got to

266
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,000
fill up individual buckets and and

267
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:17,278
manage the nutrients for each individual

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,078
plant but like you mentioned has a

269
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,480
downsize for recirculating system if

270
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,639
you've got all different cultivars in

271
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,920
there and they have kind of different

272
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,199
nutrient uptake it can be finicky right

273
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,719
you can have some plants that are

274
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,600
perfectly healthy and others that are

275
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,120
deficient so yeah there's definitely

276
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
some pros and cons to both of those

277
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
methods and that's pretty cool that you

278
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,240
do the rdwc method and know that you

279
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,959
actually built your own setup can you

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,159
talk to us about the DIY hydroponic

281
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,039
recirculating system that you set up

282
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,360
well for my setups for the most part I I

283
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,319
like to have a basis and you know before

284
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
I build so I can have some expectations

285
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,278
at the end um a lot of it does pertain

286
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,719
to budget and the space to have to work

287
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,559
with and more or less trying to maximize

288
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,240
the the usage as of what I have already

289
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,078
and what I need to get with my 2x4

290
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,159
design um I designed

291
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,679
a like I mentioned a three plan rdwc

292
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,799
system um I I also kind of implicated a

293
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:19,078
waterfall to get like top roots with top

294
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,359
with some some moisture as well uh those

295
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,638
are kind of like

296
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,800
a like the idea of a bubble bubble ponic

297
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,919
kind of a system where we have a

298
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,719
waterfall and then give some new to the

299
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,278
top route so they can expand through the

300
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,800
oxygen gap between the the bubbles

301
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,799
coming from the bottom of the water so

302
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,199
you don't essentially don't want to feel

303
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,958
like your the water too high I have a

304
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,759
four like a a 4 gallon bucket I I merely

305
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,159
fill it up like a third and then it kind

306
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,958
of all the moisture hits the roots

307
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,600
anyways and there's very little dry back

308
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,679
the basics to some some deep water

309
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,159
cultures require a reservoir depending

310
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,359
on how you go about adding your

311
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,759
nutrients I personally deleted my

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,480
reservoir and even my chiller for for

313
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,159
more space within my

314
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,000
room um but depending on your situation

315
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,759
I know it's kind of humid where you stay

316
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
water temperatures might be like you

317
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,519
know kind of kind of up there uh so I

318
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,759
can imagine using your Chiller would be

319
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,120
more optimal for you guys um

320
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,399
unfortunately I didn't need that so I

321
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,759
kind of pulled it saved some electricity

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,078
and the extra you know computer tower

323
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,480
that to sit on the outside of my tents

324
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,039
but here in Cali we're I'm pretty good

325
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,800
with my water temps at Mid 60 sometimes

326
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,759
I mean the colder the better not too

327
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,078
cold but colder Roots the the better the

328
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,838
uptake from for the most part like I was

329
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,679
mentioned earlier about Space Management

330
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,440
so I I do a lot of measurements I make

331
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,759
sure everything does fit um especially

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
with the buckets uh they're not easy to

333
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,639
find for like let's

334
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,199
say um aside from commercial use you got

335
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,799
to go far why trying to find these

336
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,599
buckets with their proper Lids if they

337
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,399
don't already come with them I use Uline

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
um they do sell a lot of commercial

339
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,120
materials for like you know job sites

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
and this and that but you know anybody

341
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,000
can purchase it regardless of your

342
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,240
setatus of wholesaler or being in

343
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,399
business um to be honest I I found my

344
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,879
buckets at Home

345
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,360
Depot they were uh they were sitting on

346
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,399
a stack I guess they were um putting

347
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,320
flowers in them and like they were there

348
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,600
to take so I'm like oh can I have these

349
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm going to use them for a project I'm

350
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,800
like yeah I take a few if you want

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,399
they're essentially trash but there's

352
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,039
some nice black buckets that I found

353
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,198
Lids on UL line for and I drilled off

354
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,159
some holes um added a a netting pot on

355
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:36,000
there to hold my uh my rock wool my

356
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,600
essentially the plant that's going to be

357
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,919
growing in there for the rest of it Life

358
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,000
by the way my my netting pods are

359
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,639
anywhere from like 8 in pretty big ones

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,440
that sit halfway through the bucket and

361
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,639
I mean great expansion for my roots and

362
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,160
The Rock will opens up pretty well I

363
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,159
feel the gaps with um with um hydr and

364
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,759
and it does pretty well with the

365
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,399
drainage for that same reason and as for

366
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:05,320
like the uh the flow I I've gone from

367
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,799
tubing vinyl tubing to PVC piping I

368
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,040
found different um Outlets to on on

369
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,879
Uline and even Amazon for that same

370
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,799
reason too kind of build it properly

371
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,320
make sure everything fits and for the

372
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,278
same reason you you don't want to make

373
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,759
build something like this and not be

374
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,278
sure that's not going to fail the worst

375
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,440
thing in the world is a water leak

376
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,320
Midway through your you're grow and you

377
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,480
have to like flush and then redo it all

378
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,160
over again dismantle it and find your

379
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,839
leak seal it and go for it that's that's

380
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,958
kind of the nightmare of a of

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,880
Hydroponics or or deep water cultur it's

382
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,559
like filling the bottom of your your

383
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,198
tent with with uh with

384
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:47,039
water getting that vacuum out you

385
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,278
mentioned 4 gallon buckets why 4 gallon

386
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,198
would it be better with a larger bucket

387
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,919
or smaller why why four um it really

388
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,399
really depends on like again the spacing

389
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,599
that you have um the taller the bucket

390
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,440
uh I probably wouldn't mind too much but

391
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,278
the the 4 gallon bucket um height and

392
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,079
anywhere from like a a foot and a/4 up

393
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,559
and then they're like maybe 10 in wide

394
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,399
so it's a great fit um for giving the

395
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,559
space for the pent to grow upwards and

396
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,559
it doesn't take too much space around it

397
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,838
so I can have piping and um other things

398
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:23,000
like different fans and uh maybe a pump

399
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,279
for my water within the tent more as a

400
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,440
cleaner area and now you have a

401
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,399
concerned of the roots kind of filling

402
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,279
up that space how do you know like I

403
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,799
guess plant size to bucket size that's

404
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:40,799
kind of like a blessing in um you

405
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,240
know uh in in a situational in itself

406
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,679
because like the more Roots definitely

407
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,278
you want to get everyone wants Roots you

408
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,958
want to fill your even in so you want to

409
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,120
fill your bucket your your pot over

410
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,159
Roots as much as you can at the same

411
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,639
time we I have my my water flowing

412
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,799
through one another and U these roots

413
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,240
can get clogged within those pipes and

414
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,758
at the same time that's why people have

415
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,839
bigger pipes so the roots don't kind of

416
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,839
like clog up and and affect the next the

417
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,240
next pot over um but yeah that's that's

418
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,560
ble all in itself so like you want the

419
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
big Roots but at the same time you don't

420
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,758
want clogs either because you need that

421
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,278
water to flow in not overflow at the

422
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:23,079
same time my um my drip it's taken out

423
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,838
of the um one of the same buckets that's

424
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,679
connected so it's taking water from the

425
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,519
bottom and throwing it on top of each of

426
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,039
the of the other Bott buckets so it's

427
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,519
this is going to overflow if I have one

428
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,198
of them cloged at the same time so

429
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,000
maintaining them is definitely a good

430
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,519
idea keeping an eye on them got it that

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,318
makes sense and then what size tubing or

432
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,919
or PVC and how do you kind of determine

433
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:44,919
that I know you said you're using a for

434
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,078
gal like what size tubing for the for

435
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,360
gal and then is it Go by number of

436
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,559
plants to the size tubing does that

437
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,959
relate at all or no with this my most uh

438
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,119
recent um build it it was availability

439
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,479
um and I would have definitely went

440
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,078
bigger tubing I personally have it at an

441
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,400
inch and a half um almost 2 inch so um I

442
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,959
would definitely have gone to two or

443
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,759
three but the second part that's needed

444
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,519
wasn't always available so the knuckle

445
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,480
that I I I thread the PVC into I didn't

446
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,679
have the other part to go go bigger than

447
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,120
what I had so it's I'm dealt those cars

448
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,679
so I kind of make the best of it if

449
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,798
anything but I hope they have a 3in like

450
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,798
threaded knuckle I can add to my next

451
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,279
setup I definitely would go bigger for

452
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:31,240
that same reason with the roots and and

453
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:33,319
the clogging issues um ABS maybe um it's

454
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,038
it's black versus white it's it'll Tak

455
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,240
in less less lighting and no buildup of

456
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,119
like Aly between the tubes it's thick

457
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,279
enough I believe so I I personally

458
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,879
haven't come across it with this tube

459
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,839
but you will with vinyl all day okay

460
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
good to know and then Reservoir if I

461
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,000
know you said you're not running a

462
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,799
reservoir but for those that are looking

463
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,359
to run a reservoir how do they determine

464
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,319
what size to use Reservoir space um

465
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,839
personally I have or when I did have my

466
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,079
reservoir it it was great to have it um

467
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,720
to the left of my or what whichever side

468
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,678
of my tent um with that Reservoir out

469
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,079
there you're going to have to find the

470
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:15,960
means to uh run a line and you can't run

471
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,319
lines um horizontally or or you know at

472
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,600
an angle or anything like that for that

473
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,678
same reason you need to have it level to

474
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,639
the ground so the water can flow and a

475
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,400
lot of these tents aren't made with like

476
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,799
you know outlets at the bottom of of the

477
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,840
tent they're usually like you know have

478
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,279
fo it up for like you know ducks or or

479
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,199
or cables so you're going to have to

480
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,678
punch some holes to the bottle of your T

481
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,519
and you know kind of modify uh an outlet

482
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,919
so you can find a side for your

483
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,960
Reservoir and as for the size of it it

484
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,799
really depends on and how much you want

485
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:53,519
to like uh suspend for your tanks to use

486
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,759
so it's a reservoir and then like like a

487
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,759
an automatic fill so when your Reservoir

488
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,879
starts losing water it starts refilling

489
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,759
from the top bucket um and those go

490
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,000
anywhere from like 10 15 Gallons uh

491
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,119
they're they're convenient as hell

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,839
really you don't have to go inside your

493
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,359
tent um you your your refills are are

494
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,079
much easier um I want to say maybe your

495
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,759
flushing it probably be more of a pain

496
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,480
in kind of clearing out you know an

497
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,879
extra bucket um especially if your your

498
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,720
grow is more

499
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,120
compact but um again I I I always look

500
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,640
for you know more efficiency for my turn

501
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,558
and you know how much more easier it

502
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,679
would be you it's the same same idea or

503
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,480
outcome um I'm probably going to go for

504
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,798
the the ladder in and then can you talk

505
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,000
to us about like pump size like if

506
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,839
somebody's building their own system and

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,319
you know whether it be a four plant

508
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,678
system or eight plant system like how do

509
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,079
they determine what pump size and how

510
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,798
many airstones to kind of put in each

511
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:49,720
bucket I'm to be honest I've always find

512
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,798
myself always going bigger the better

513
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,480
for for some things or um the better

514
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,400
quality and and brand for that same

515
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,120
reason but there's definitely a minimum

516
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,519
of like let's say um free air pump I I

517
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,678
have a a three plant system with 6 in uh

518
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,319
flat airstones and I have one commercial

519
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,600
pump with Outlets running for all of

520
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,319
them um there's there's definitely

521
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,000
smaller versions of them less loud or

522
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,798
more loud for that um really depending

523
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,558
your situation um General General

524
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,400
Hydroponics they they make some simple

525
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:25,399
puns with like pre- Outlets Amazon has

526
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,798
several pumps that um they're really

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
affordable and and they come with

528
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,519
Outlets too and and not you know to be

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,558
honest they're not as bad they're just a

530
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,679
name really they're all PR remade in the

531
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:39,480
same place um but I I I personally use a

532
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:42,360
commercial one it's it's yay big and

533
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,120
it's very quiet has some rubber like

534
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,959
like feet so it kind of vibrations go

535
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,359
off the

536
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,759
floor um it runs 24 hours I've been

537
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,038
running it for several years now didn't

538
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,279
spend too much on it um again it's one

539
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,119
of those things I I was able to purchase

540
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,000
like um I think someone had it used

541
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,038
fall out on someone on Instagram or not

542
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,558
Instagram on offer up you know um

543
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,158
Growers fall out all the time and they

544
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,918
kind of give up on a hobby and I come up

545
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,080
on some of these products um here in

546
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:14,360
California we have shops that close down

547
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,918
on on on the regular and turn around and

548
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,439
have the sell their their materials and

549
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,880
and like uh you know parts and that's me

550
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
picking it up on the other end if I

551
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,799
could find it you know so you mentioned

552
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,720
8 in net pots is what you have within

553
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:31,278
the buckets you use rock wall and

554
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,679
hydroton surrounding it can you talk to

555
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:36,400
us about kind of using the Rockwell from

556
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,720
start to finish do you start Cuts in it

557
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,919
and then kind of have it in your

558
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,600
seedling area and then switch it over to

559
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,360
the bucket or how do you go about that

560
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,959
um I I believe Rockwell has gone a long

561
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,558
way especially with tech um there's a

562
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,798
brand grodan um they're they're kind of

563
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,558
big on on their products but they they

564
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,400
make different versions I mean everyone

565
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,158
makes rock wool but they actually use

566
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,200
their their plugs and their 4 in cubes

567
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,720
I've big used bigger ones for it to to

568
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,798
kind of experiment but it's not really

569
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,600
necessary unless you're going to do like

570
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:13,679
a drip to drain kind of like set up but

571
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:17,158
um I start with plugs um they're

572
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,320
see or you know small little cubes um

573
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,520
and these are I insert them into another

574
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:26,038
4in Cube as I go so my seedlings and my

575
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:30,210
uh my FR cut clones I I I drop them in

576
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:38,348
there and kind of uh

577
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:38,348
[Music]

578
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,119
[Music]

579
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,038
nutrients what do you use for a nutrient

580
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,278
lineup currently um for actually last

581
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,759
couple years I've been using um

582
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,480
Athena uh they've been pretty

583
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,960
consistent not Rocky at all really from

584
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,640
from day one I i' I've been pretty uh

585
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,600
haven't really dropped the ball like

586
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,799
everything that I put in there it works

587
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:52,719
pretty to to its word um follow the

588
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,599
instructions the guidelines and and if I

589
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
really wanted to I've tried

590
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,119
experimenting like bumping up ratios see

591
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,600
if it kind of you know messes with the

592
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,079
plan or if they like it a little bit

593
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,599
more but I got to different ppms

594
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,599
between flower stages and they can go

595
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,000
pretty high um if you harden your plants

596
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,959
well enough they can take they can

597
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,200
they'll take a lot of salt um for that

598
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:20,720
same reason um like I I go by PPM I

599
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,558
really don't go by um EC I I I'm a

600
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,079
numbers guy so I like seeing the numbers

601
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,398
that break down pretty the detail and EC

602
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,278
is like two points and I can't really

603
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:32,079
break that down or vit themin to my

604
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,960
nutrients that I mixed into it most

605
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,480
recently but um I I love it you know if

606
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
anything I'm thinking of moving over to

607
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,399
their um their salt mix if I ever expand

608
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,720
my op and and you know need more liquid

609
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,879
for that same same part of it um but I

610
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,319
it come from other nutrients like

611
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,480
psycho um even like psycho is good it's

612
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,558
not it's now really to be honest a lot

613
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,120
of these nutrients aren't bad at all

614
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,720
none of them aren it's it's just really

615
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:04,038
their ratio and how they formulate um to

616
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,360
for these plants to work and you know

617
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,558
everybody knows these plants are

618
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,558
different so they're going to take up

619
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,319
these nutrients differently and then

620
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:14,200
that's up to the to the grower The

621
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:16,000
Gardener to kind of like fine-tune that

622
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,200
their ratios and and give the plant what

623
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,960
they like so you know a lot of these

624
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,600
companies are not mentioning like here

625
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,720
this is yours you do with it what you

626
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,480
will or and you figure it out but you

627
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,079
know they want to make it easy I mean

628
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,240
they have their charts and to to a to a

629
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,720
base it works but to make it better it's

630
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,200
it's really up to the grower um and that

631
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,880
goes with a lot of variables you know

632
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,319
conditions lighting and and exactly what

633
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,320
the plant may

634
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,278
prefer but I run Athena and hopefully I

635
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,200
can keep on doing it I've heard a lot of

636
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,359
good things about Athena a lot of people

637
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
seem to be jumping over to Athena and

638
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,879
using them just because of the results

639
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,399
that you see people getting out of them

640
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,600
and um I heard a lot of good things

641
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,839
about e of use they make it really easy

642
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,639
to use

643
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,519
now you mentioned PPM are you talking

644
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,159
500 scale or 700 scale and also are you

645
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,519
adjusting the PPM that you have that

646
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:10,919
you're giving to your plants throughout

647
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,240
the growth cycle so it gets higher as

648
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,960
you go from fegge to flour or how do you

649
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,558
go about that I go 500 um for the scale

650
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,960
if anything and um yeah by stage I I try

651
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,079
to pay pay attention to to what the plan

652
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,840
is like and how they react they're if

653
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,839
they're praying at the time of with with

654
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,918
enough heat um really it does fluctuate

655
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,599
from vegetation to to flowering um when

656
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,320
I find that within flowering you know

657
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,558
they're they're lacking a little bit I

658
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,678
kick down some things so so they can

659
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,839
pick up but if if they're really liking

660
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:48,038
it I do add I add and I add until until

661
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,439
I see a lacking um if if they start

662
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,398
showing some some bad signs I definitely

663
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,960
take away but um I haven't actually so

664
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:59,038
I've heard other girls go um you know

665
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,120
several thousand um in PPM like you know

666
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,398
3,000 PPM to to a point of like you know

667
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,479
you don't even imagine that for your

668
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,398
plants and how they can really uptake it

669
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,360
but if you have the right setup and your

670
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:10,558
and your roots are really clean if if

671
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,918
they're big enough and they're able to

672
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,759
uptake they will um and you know finding

673
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
that plant finding that mother that you

674
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,558
know is suitable for such conditions is

675
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,359
is the you know part of the journey

676
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,038
definitely between my growth Cycles I

677
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,678
try to up as much so they can take as

678
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,839
much nutrients um for that same reason

679
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,600
more or less towards the end I try to be

680
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,038
real more critical and kind of sensitive

681
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,639
to seedlings and even teens at some

682
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,000
points because they're not they're not

683
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm not giving them the full love back

684
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,798
until they really s step into the

685
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,960
flowering

686
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,240
stage um especially with their lacking

687
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,640
root expansion okay and then are you

688
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,200
changing nutrient is it every week where

689
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,200
there's kind of like a new ratio that

690
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,278
you're kind of increasing week by week

691
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,319
and when you do that change are you

692
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,200
doing any type of like is cleaning of

693
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,918
the buckets or anything with any

694
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
cleaning solution or you just rinsing

695
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,720
them all with water and then putting in

696
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,159
the next week's nutrient mix in with

697
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,038
with my water at least I use purified

698
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,480
water like everyone should um

699
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:11,480
unfortunately I don't I have like a

700
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,720
purifying system um which I should

701
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,599
actually every Hydroponics person should

702
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,278
have a filtration system especially if

703
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,199
you're growing uh clean water is is

704
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,839
necessary especially if you're drinking

705
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,360
or consuming anything from it um my

706
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,879
water is uh between my buckets and and

707
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:31,798
more or less flushing between the Cycles

708
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,000
I definitely do that so going from

709
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,079
vegetation to clearly to to you know a

710
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,079
flowering or fooding stage all that

711
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,599
water is going out being dumped into my

712
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,798
outdoor grows and reused one way or the

713
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,038
other the the buckets are then like

714
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,398
rinsed out with that same water again

715
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:53,960
thrown into the the outside grow stuff

716
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:56,199
um I don't do full flushes um if that's

717
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,480
one of the questions I'm sorry um

718
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,319
towards the end um with with what

719
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
research I've learned I mean even Bruce

720
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,200
bugby was like I mean there's no results

721
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,720
after the fact you're kind of

722
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,840
deteriorating doing the even the the the

723
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,240
3 days after uh after um that flush um a

724
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,918
lot of those bro signs is kind of going

725
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,599
out the door and um initially when I

726
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,720
started growing I I try to like throw

727
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,240
that use do all the stuff that I can

728
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,240
imagine that you know would make my

729
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,599
plant um bigger or or more or go more

730
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,919
vigorously a lot of it wasn't consistent

731
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,719
enough for me to continue to keep on

732
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,038
doing it so really I'm just following

733
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,839
directions into what my nutrient line

734
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:40,640
ask for and um if it does requir that I

735
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:42,599
I flush uh it hasn't really but there

736
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,000
there definitely things to do so there

737
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,759
that there's definitely means to flush

738
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,038
aside from pulling out you know uh

739
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,359
excess nutrients from your plants um if

740
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,079
you're changing up from different Cycles

741
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,319
like I mentioned you definitely want to

742
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,519
have a clean a clean start and not have

743
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,639
anything behind that can mix into what

744
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,079
you're putting in

745
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,240
new um if you if I find that there's

746
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,639
something lacking within my my mix I'll

747
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,798
I'll get runoff test the runoff and see

748
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,278
how that how that is how it looks on my

749
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:18,000
uh my tester um opposed to how it's

750
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,599
running within the system um this may

751
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,599
kind of confuse a lot of people when

752
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,678
when they're testing water that's inside

753
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,798
the system because the AirStone kind of

754
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,480
makes pH levels fluctuate so you know

755
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,639
pull your water out test it test a

756
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
runoff

757
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,519
don't test don't test your stuff in

758
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,200
motion because a lot of it running

759
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,720
around is is going to mess with your

760
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,679
testers and it'll it'll kind of mess you

761
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
up on

762
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,600
paper um but yeah from the last question

763
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,559
I I raised up my my nutrient levels my

764
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,038
my PPN between Cycles with that being

765
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,918
said I I don't want to mess mess up my

766
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,960
numbers that I already put down and kind

767
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,559
of add to another one I I will top off

768
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,200
my levels with the same nutrients as

769
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:02,079
they're growing um and but I I don't mix

770
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,558
uh different nutrients to uh to fill it

771
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,158
up it's definitely fleshed out and we

772
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,398
start fresh when we go to new cycle got

773
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,720
it now you mentioned you use that

774
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,079
nutrient solution on your outdoor plants

775
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,319
now how do you get it from uh pretty

776
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,879
basic question here but what do you use

777
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,839
to get it from your grow tent that are

778
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,799
in the buckets on the floor of the grow

779
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:27,158
tent how do you get that out into your

780
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:28,960
yard using a a shopvac or using a sub

781
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:31,880
pump like how do you remove the water

782
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,600
from the buckets uh that I mean ENT

783
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,919
initially that was a big uh you know a

784
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,959
big question in my head to kind of

785
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,320
transfer a lot of liquid um I I've got

786
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,278
myself some some bigger like um

787
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,240
containers blue containers um to to fill

788
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,960
the liquid with but at the same time yes

789
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,440
I I do use a shop back a wet wet dry

790
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,278
back and I I pull out all the water and

791
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,840
then it's another another breakdown

792
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:58,200
between the system and having to pull it

793
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,558
out and rs out really quickly the

794
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
rinsing is is a good thing and I I I

795
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,798
really promote the the whole rinsing

796
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,720
part of it because you don't want any

797
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,158
clogs you don't want any leaks you want

798
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,960
to make sure that your system is still

799
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,960
consistent to to work the next cycle and

800
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,960
and and you know longer my drip system

801
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,759
it clogs a lot the the sedative the the

802
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,880
sediment from the the salt buildup um I

803
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,839
mean the only way to clear that stuff

804
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,440
the lines is is is another solution to

805
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,398
add to your to your um your wire which

806
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,440
you don't want to do you don't want to

807
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:32,079
add a a solution to clear your lines

808
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,759
that's going to also go into your plants

809
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,158
um I mean take it out and do it in

810
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,798
another another time and you know keep

811
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,600
it running as you can and as my plants

812
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,119
are suspended out out of the water while

813
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,278
I'm cleaning I mean they're they're

814
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,558
going to dry back and they're still wet

815
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,038
nothing happens to them they're still in

816
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,519
their

817
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,919
light but maintaining is a big deal

818
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,200
especially with you know anything

819
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,320
hydroponic any any system that you want

820
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,278
to run consistently like a car you want

821
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,079
to make sure that car has gas and oil

822
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:03,759
you want make sure your system is clean

823
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,638
and and and clear

824
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,000
salts um the buildup does happen and

825
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:10,519
everything is dirty you wash your dishes

826
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,919
for a reason you don't want to wash your

827
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,759
your your pots or your buckets from the

828
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:18,038
same things you're going to eat off that

829
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,359
makes sense so we talked about PPM but

830
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,519
we didn't talk about pH yet can you talk

831
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:25,079
about pH a little bit like what you

832
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:27,000
typically aim for on a week to we basis

833
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,398
I'm always trying to sit between a 6 and

834
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,359
1/2 and at seven um when it comes to my

835
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:37,278
my my hydro water flowing um I always

836
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,759
started a z um a zero like PPM when when

837
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,038
I have fresh water and it's always

838
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:46,119
tested and and mixed in before I drop it

839
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:48,599
all in there um I buffer my pH with a um

840
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:51,119
with athenus balance so so anything that

841
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:54,158
has a silica in it it kind of raise your

842
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,278
pH and you can work it out from there so

843
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,480
you're always adding your silic first um

844
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:59,558
and then building out from there and

845
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,960
then kind of fine tuning between where

846
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,240
you want to be at on on your pH and your

847
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,559
PPM um I mean I go pretty light with my

848
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,199
uh my ceilings and and anything in

849
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,480
vegetation um more I just want to keep

850
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,638
keep my my veg stuff like

851
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,679
consistent and and and expand on root

852
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,760
zones and then move it over so when it

853
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,240
comes to like my pH it does definitely

854
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,000
need to be consistent because um in my

855
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,239
my veg everything is um is pure rock

856
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
wool it's all like uh uh feed feed the

857
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,598
drain so they're sitting in trays so I

858
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,960
got to pay attention I see those guys

859
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,559
every day I want to make sure that

860
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,519
dryback is not too long and and are able

861
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,398
to like open up their roots and uh for

862
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,800
the same part like lighting isn't

863
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,679
building too much algae on anything so

864
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,240
maintaining maintaining that is is kind

865
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,918
of revolves around the pH because

866
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,799
something else goes bad it may fluctuate

867
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,838
the ph and then I have to flush that and

868
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,720
it's even more difficult when you're

869
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,759
working with rock you can't really flush

870
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:00,759
the rock uh unless you sit it over water

871
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,560
for times and and that's a big headache

872
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,079
you almost want to start over again and

873
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,920
just you know pull it out drop it in

874
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,359
another quebe but you know it it's

875
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,559
definitely not as easy as you think got

876
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:14,598
it now on the topic of DIY you also

877
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,880
created a DIY double trellis net can you

878
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,320
talk to us how you went about doing that

879
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,160
net yeah um that actually expanded from

880
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,519
one of my one of my first couple grows I

881
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,319
had a bigger 10 um it was a 5x5 instead

882
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:30,880
of my 2x4s I broke it down too I I kind

883
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,720
of saw saw um an example from like Mr

884
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,280
kanuck when I was watching his videos a

885
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,799
lot of he gets really really tall plants

886
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,079
um but they're always flopping

887
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,920
around um even if he has a single trist

888
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,680
and it they just flop around so I mean I

889
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,720
imagine like why not have a double chal

890
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,239
run one and then when it surpasses that

891
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,480
one run the second one I mean you're

892
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,759
always going to have stragglers at the

893
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,920
bottom that you're going to want to like

894
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,079
kind of move over to the corner or to a

895
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,639
point where you have lighting I know

896
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,160
nowadays there's a lot of like side

897
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,358
lights or stuff you can add to the

898
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:07,078
bottom of your tent to to add um add

899
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,799
some sun but not everyone has that same

900
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,519
thing so you got you want to train I'm

901
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm big on training and it comes to like

902
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,318
um putting positioning your plants or or

903
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,679
even like kind of like bony them to a

904
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:21,759
point where they they they lay down lay

905
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:24,358
down on you you know my first grow I had

906
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,839
one plant that was you know filled the

907
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:30,960
whole 5x5 uh tent and I was running that

908
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,119
Tris where I can get them lay

909
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,039
sideways um toward the end of the the

910
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,519
other end of the plan and it grew out

911
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,599
big it was it was my first grow and I I

912
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,400
put like slightly little than 500 or and

913
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,318
I had I mean I still have a little bit

914
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,280
left over from years ago if anything but

915
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:52,000
uh the the t is definitely it's

916
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,280
definitely a big help um PVC piping it's

917
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,800
lightweight it's it's really like

918
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,800
flexible you can put it and you move

919
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,240
around as you please

920
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
um just be good with your measurements

921
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,279
uh you know materials aren't too costly

922
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,239
when it comes to things like that uh the

923
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,720
reason I built my own I mean not

924
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,318
stacking two on top of one another it's

925
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,959
another cost effective kind of thing I

926
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:14,079
mean if you notice how much these things

927
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,760
cost a line they're you're mostly paying

928
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,280
for the shipping I I for instance I I

929
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,000
love gorilla go tent and clearly they

930
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,480
they sell everything nowadays it's like

931
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,039
um AC Infinity they they're a kind of

932
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,119
One-Stop shop I I Gorilla Grow Tent is

933
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,599
here inia

934
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,519
I want I wanted to buy a $20 trellis net

935
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,559
and it was another like you know 25 or

936
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,719
$30 to ship it over to me I'm like can I

937
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,000
pick it up it's right here in Los

938
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,879
Angeles like unfortunately no we can't

939
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,599
so that was my turn around to go to Home

940
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,920
Depot was like another less five miles

941
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,039
and you know go build my own with some

942
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,639
string um or you can go go on Amazon

943
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:55,719
pick up the trellis net and and run over

944
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,759
some a frame of your own uh it's it's

945
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,000
pretty basic but I mean it goes without

946
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,319
was saying like you really just have to

947
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,440
put yourself forward and have to you

948
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,800
know want to make these things and not

949
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,920
have to wait for shipping or you know

950
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,480
paying someone else to make it for you

951
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,119
and I I kind of pushed that you know

952
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,800
across across the board we've seen a lot

953
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,800
of things I do whether it's growing or

954
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,800
fixing a car if I can't fix it if I

955
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,640
don't know 100% sure I'm not going to do

956
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,160
it but if I can I'm going to attempt but

957
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,000
you know without any loss for the most

958
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,279
part you can certainly save a bunch of

959
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,318
money doing a DIY and I think that's

960
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,400
more one of the reasons why a lot of

961
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:31,679
people go go for it you know not just

962
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,800
because they're good with their hands

963
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,239
but because it's going to save them

964
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,720
money as well so for these the PVC

965
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,118
double trellis what size PVC and then

966
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,239
when you're connecting them and they

967
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,559
have what's it called the elbow pieces

968
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:46,318
are you putting any is there any like

969
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,719
glue or any sealant or anything that

970
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,318
connects the two to make sure everything

971
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,279
locks in place or what it really depends

972
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:55,000
on you um if you wanted to have like a

973
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,519
permanent fixture yeah there there is a

974
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,358
PVC adhesive that specifically for for

975
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,400
PVC so the plastic can stick to one

976
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,880
another um and then they also have um

977
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,318
like threaded joints so you can get

978
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,559
where you can just you know screw them

979
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:10,000
in there and then reuse them again later

980
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,400
I I prefer more the threaded joints so

981
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,079
if you ever wanted to break down that

982
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,559
same uh trellis you can um and I did

983
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,680
that same thing um I had a big 5x5

984
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,960
trellis I I broke down and I I made a

985
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,318
3X3 trellis to fit a shower grow um and

986
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,280
I just moved it around I try to reuse as

987
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:29,559
much as I can and I mean I may not have

988
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,519
a 5x5 in but you know now I have another

989
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:37,000
opportunity to use it for my a small

990
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:39,000
3x3 um but yeah it it's it's uh for

991
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,159
putting it together it's really to your

992
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,480
spec so if you plan on reusing it don't

993
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,960
go the permanent route shoot for a

994
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,079
threaded so you can screw it in and

995
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,358
unscrew it if you find that you're it's

996
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:50,119
something going to be a staple within

997
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,759
that same 10 that's not going to change

998
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,519
go ahe and get an adhesive um it smells

999
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,160
at first but it's nontoxic it's not

1000
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:59,759
going to bother your plants um um it's

1001
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,480
it'll set it and you can forget it for

1002
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,079
the most part good to know and then for

1003
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,800
the actual thread that is run the ones

1004
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,240
I've seen online with people doing it

1005
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,640
they're basically just taking screws and

1006
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,719
then putting it into the side of the PVC

1007
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,879
at a certain spacing and then they're

1008
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,118
using the the twine string and running

1009
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,240
it up and down up and down to make

1010
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,640
squares is that pretty much how you do

1011
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,879
it or like what's your method of of that

1012
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,719
part I want to say my my mark one my my

1013
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,039
first prototype I definitely did the

1014
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:36,919
whole eyelid screws into the into the

1015
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:40,000
PVC it definitely is um more tedious of

1016
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,880
work you also have to make sure your

1017
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,760
measurements are on point with how how

1018
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,280
big you want the squares so when I my

1019
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,359
double trellis I I did like a a 4in

1020
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,160
square to a 6in square so it can kind of

1021
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,920
like open up between you know how L

1022
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,279
expands um with the eyelid screws that

1023
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,079
you're going to put in there you're

1024
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,560
you're kind of GNA have to play

1025
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,599
Spider-Man and go and the end and if you

1026
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,358
know one line kind of is loosened then

1027
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,599
you're going to have like a floppy area

1028
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,598
for that same reason um I found that

1029
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,760
getting the the nylon ones on Amazon are

1030
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,280
just as good and you're going to find

1031
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,319
that zip tis are going to be your best

1032
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,400
friend and that goes across the board

1033
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,599
too between your whole grow zip ties are

1034
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,599
are are a savior get that zip tie and

1035
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,079
just ratchet it on there um between the

1036
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,800
the right the right net and you can

1037
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,920
modify the net as big it is and cut it

1038
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,280
it's no big deal those things are like

1039
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,960
seven bucks on Amazon um people also use

1040
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,560
like you know wood they for their

1041
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,119
framing like 2x4s I mean they have to

1042
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,400
scre it more properly it's not

1043
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,960
lightweight but I like hanging my my

1044
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,559
trus from from the top of my 10 so I can

1045
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,159
kind of like adjust it as I please that

1046
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,838
makes sense yeah it sounds like it's a

1047
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,879
lot easier to just buy the the nylon net

1048
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:56,039
and then zip tie it to the PVC piping

1049
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,280
save a bunch of time there I'm sure yeah

1050
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,599
and headaches yeah so for all these DIY

1051
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,519
projects whether it be the hydroponic

1052
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,640
setup you have or the DIY double trellis

1053
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,719
what are some of the problems that

1054
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,920
you've come across and how did you

1055
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,598
resolve them you've already kind of come

1056
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,599
talked a little bit about the water leak

1057
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,440
and and clogged pipes not sure if you

1058
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,200
can expand on that at all or if there's

1059
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,039
anything else that comes to mind and to

1060
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,199
be honest those are kind of the biggest

1061
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:27,279
nightmares the the leaks and not being

1062
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:28,159
around when the leak happens um I mean

1063
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,880
there are several things that could

1064
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,679
happen between a hydro product setup

1065
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,240
because um you get to a point where you

1066
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,960
want a lot of things to be automated so

1067
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,838
if if you want to set in forget it walk

1068
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,480
out of the room and make sure

1069
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:43,199
everything's still running it's you want

1070
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,559
to make sure everything's confirmed

1071
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,358
working um to walk out of the room and

1072
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,240
then get a power outage and now all of a

1073
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,279
sudden you know half your pumps aren't

1074
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,358
going your your your roofs are sitting

1075
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,359
in water uh for this amount of time and

1076
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:59,519
it it's so idle and it just built a

1077
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:02,039
bacteria that you don't one um I mean

1078
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,519
that that's that's a crucial you know

1079
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,000
hold down for you when you come back to

1080
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,400
a room that's not on anymore and you

1081
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,440
have to run a breaker in the back to

1082
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,480
turn it back on some people aren't Keen

1083
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,720
to those things they're like then

1084
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,199
they're freaking out like they're

1085
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,919
calling all their friends and like sh my

1086
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,159
power is off how you turn it back on um

1087
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,200
I mean there's there's several things um

1088
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:24,719
Power running out a weather conditions

1089
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,838
California is pretty pretty upset and

1090
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,759
weather it kind of changes every day I'm

1091
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:32,119
look at have the Sun out today but like

1092
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,440
the last few days it was just raining um

1093
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:37,079
we're in

1094
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,800
February um uh I could say that anything

1095
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,039
that kind of affects the household or

1096
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,960
the room kind of affects the environment

1097
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:46,480
on the

1098
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,440
inside um with things turning off on you

1099
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,039
or things not working when you're away

1100
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,358
from it I mean for that same reason

1101
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,719
that's why I have cameras within my

1102
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,799
tents I keep an eye on

1103
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:59,598
them 24/7 it's almost like I wish I had

1104
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,200
a camera on my kid for that same reason

1105
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,920
put cam on top of her head so I know

1106
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,279
what she's doing this whole time I

1107
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,318
wouldn't have to worry so much but the

1108
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,200
these are other kids that can't fend for

1109
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,558
themselves and and and get sick if

1110
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,919
something touches them wrong so um it's

1111
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,800
definitely a hobby and put yourself in

1112
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,760
the position to be more caring or more

1113
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,559
observant to things that that you want

1114
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,559
to you know love and pay attention to

1115
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,240
especially you get to you know you get

1116
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,720
to have your cake and eat it too at the

1117
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,399
end um and it goes across the board with

1118
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,279
opland

1119
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
who who doesn't like an apple from their

1120
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,760
own

1121
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,838
tree uh you see here but you know with

1122
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,760
these uh these ideas of things walking

1123
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:41,558
into the problems the the things that

1124
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
you want to you know most worry about

1125
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,200
things are things that are out of your

1126
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,639
heads if you have things running out

1127
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:51,000
automatically then you can have like you

1128
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,400
know a slight you know slight weight

1129
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,760
lifted off your shoulder because you

1130
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,440
know it's working the cameras help a lot

1131
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,720
because I can pay attention from from a

1132
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,200
distance

1133
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,519
um especially if I can hear things

1134
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,879
running like okay that's a good sign but

1135
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,838
all of a sudden as I get a notification

1136
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,240
that my camera is off or it's not

1137
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:10,199
working either somebody's robbing me or

1138
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,439
or or my stuff all turned off and I'm

1139
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,358
going to come back to a quiet room and

1140
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,760
then you I'll have to figure it out and

1141
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,078
and when you're away it's probably

1142
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,079
because you're out like doing something

1143
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,000
or you know it's at night so when you

1144
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,200
come home it's like it's at the end of

1145
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,480
the day and you have to deal with a

1146
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,799
whole bunch of stuff so that that's kind

1147
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,159
of the the nightmare you don't want to

1148
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,800
walk into or expect when when having an

1149
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:35,598
automated system you know that's

1150
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,119
supposed to work on its own but uh you

1151
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,280
can you can keep away from all that

1152
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,880
stuff by foreseeing it imagine it before

1153
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,920
you're doing your build like uh I'm

1154
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,519
definitely going to not going to have

1155
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:49,000
any leaks ever because I I triple double

1156
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:51,679
check my my my water sources and and

1157
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,119
make sure that it flows in the right

1158
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,279
places I put high pressure on it on on

1159
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,838
the tubes with a hose to make sure sure

1160
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,440
nothing comes out um the triple

1161
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,719
double-checking your stuff will

1162
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,800
definitely keep you out of the realm of

1163
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,239
having to worry about it but always that

1164
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,519
thing in the back of your head like it's

1165
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,719
going to

1166
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:16,880
happen no one is is uh come uh safe from

1167
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,919
you know mishaps it's it's like the law

1168
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,800
of

1169
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,240
life we're I mean even if you're running

1170
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,640
through soil there's there's always

1171
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,558
something that that could you know

1172
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,000
surprise you through pest or or you know

1173
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,920
lacking

1174
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,159
management weather conditions things

1175
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,519
that not you're not sure that can expect

1176
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:36,879
when you come back from you know

1177
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:39,119
whatever you're doing but

1178
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,599
personally I maybe have like a water

1179
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,760
phobia but of it being everywhere um

1180
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,440
just the fact that there's a lot of

1181
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,559
electronics around it it's it's like

1182
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,240
playing with fire eventually I can see

1183
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,400
how that could be scary for some people

1184
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:55,838
for sure but the camera thing that you

1185
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,838
mentioned is pretty good idea of you

1186
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,239
know listening to the camera to see your

1187
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:02,759
equipment still kind of sounds like it's

1188
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:05,039
still on you know I don't have cameras

1189
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,839
in my grow yet I'm looking to actually

1190
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,400
put cameras in my grow what cam what

1191
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,679
brand do you use actually um I I use

1192
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,079
these blink Cabas um they're not too

1193
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:16,558
expensive I'm pretty sure you can find

1194
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,119
like 25 bucks a pop and then you can get

1195
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,000
some mounts um from Amazon where you can

1196
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,358
kind of angle them as you please and

1197
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,159
within my two 2x4s I I have them pointed

1198
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:29,078
down and I have a full coverage where I

1199
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,960
can kind of Zoom in and out has two-way

1200
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,920
sound so you can hear the sound coming

1201
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
back out and you can imagine if there

1202
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,680
was somebody else in your room you can

1203
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,440
talk to them and they can talk back as

1204
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,679
well um it's it's great on surveillance

1205
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,318
I mean to be honest when I first

1206
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,399
purchased my house surveillance was a

1207
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:45,480
big deal so I covered my house and like

1208
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,119
ring cams and I found these bling

1209
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,159
cameras on the way over I'm like hey

1210
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,599
these are inexpensive pop them to my

1211
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:54,719
tents and you know I can watch

1212
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:57,039
everything I mean eyes on eyes on me

1213
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,358
vice versa that's awesome yeah going

1214
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,599
have to get cameras going in my tent

1215
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:03,000
