1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
coming up on Garden talk it's just

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,540
basically touching the top of the soil

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,339
and what that will do is that will

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,960
incorporate all those amendments it'll

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,240
get rid of all those weed seeds that

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,280
have germinated and it also will allow

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,039
us to have soil contact with our Korean

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,899
natural farming input the soil Health

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
that we have on the farm indigenous

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,519
microorganisms or IMO is our very best

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,320
friend people are buying all these

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
bottles of microbes we call them bugs in

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,879
a jug and that's great but it's very

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,800
limited diversity out in nature you can

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,420
pick up a teaspoon of soil and within

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,880
that teaspoon of soil there are

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,160
literally thousands of different species

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,800
of microbiology Korean natural farming

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,558
has that microbiology diversity that

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,419
diversity of soil biology allows those

21
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,519
plants to uptake nutrients that are

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,520
harder to get normally that allows it

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,239
for it to be a stronger healthier plant

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,239

I'm doing good thanks for asking today

90
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,280
we're going to get into low till farming

91
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,619
a lot of people have heard of no-till

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
farming low till something kind of new

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,519
here right seems like more and more

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
Growers are going towards no-till but

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,219
low till something you're going to give

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,780
us the rundown on because you have

97
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,239
experience on it and so in this episode

98
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,878
I like to get into kind of what you do

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,680
in your garden on your farm but first

100
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,719
what I want to do which I do with all

101
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,040
guests is an introduction so can you

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,439
tell us a little bit about yourself and

103
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,719
how you got into gardening yeah my name

104
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,239
is Wendy kornberg and I run sunnibus

105
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,098
Humboldt's full sun Farms we are a small

106
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,680
family farm that grows mostly medicinal

107
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,560
plants on the banks of the Eel River in

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,560
southern Humboldt County in California

109
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,239
and I basically grew up gardening I I

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,580
don't really remember a time in my life

111
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,799
that I haven't had something growing I

112
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,019
did find when I went to college and

113
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,780
lived in an apartment for a while that

114
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not the best at growing uh plants

115
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,219
like house plants I managed to kill a

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,540
fern I managed to kill a ficus it's like

117
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,120
the plants that you're you know

118
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,439
supposedly not able to kill and then I

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,240
got orchids and found out that those

120
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,639
work very well for me because I think I

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,439
was killing them literally with kindness

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,240
I was paying too much attention to the

123
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,418
plants and orchids are supposed to die

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,680
after they bloom or so I was told so I

125
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,758
had bought some and just like they

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,500
bloomed they're beautiful and then I

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,439
ignored them and they didn't die and I

128
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,959
went oh maybe this is my key but yeah

129
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,019
other than that basically my family

130
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,079
growing up my mother had about a one

131
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:57,299
acre Garden including Orchard trees and

132
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,099
some grapevines and things like that so

133
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,620
that was always what I considered you

134
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,620
know a garden is a decent amount of

135
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,560
square footage and that was all

136
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,360
substance food for our family for the

137
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,280
winter so my mom would grow a lot of

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,020
tomatoes and you know do a bunch of

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,258
canning of spaghetti sauce and tomato

140
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:19,139
sauces and things like that we often

141
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,800
dried fruit so we would have like dried

142
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,120
apples and things for through the winter

143
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,100
potatoes you know we had a root cellar

144
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,100
so potatoes onions like all that stuff

145
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,439
canned peaches basically you name it we

146
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,539
we would try and grow it and figure out

147
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,360
how to save it over the winter awesome

148
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:38,399
so gardening all your life lots and lots

149
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,259
of experience so 18 years of gardening

150
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,478
right that's that's all your life yeah

151
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,979
yeah eight it's 20 now you know I didn't

152
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,978
Garden when I was two but yeah yeah

153
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,060
so no-till gardening a lot of people

154
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,399
know what that is but I have a lot of

155
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,439
beginners on that listen to this podcast

156
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,879
all the beginners and intermediate so

157
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,800
some people that might not know what

158
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,918
no-till is can you talk to us about what

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
no-till is and also what low till is and

160
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,299
kind of the differences between the two

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,300
yeah

162
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,720
yeah to preface

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
would wait for my dad to get the huge

164
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,579
BCS rototiller that was always kind of

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
on its last legs and oh I just I

166
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,740
remember as a kid it was so loud so she

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
would spread a lot of chicken manure and

168
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,939
some other soil amendments

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,060
um I think we usually use oyster shell a

170
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,160
little bit of green sand maybe some

171
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,139
calfas or sauce or something along those

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,840
lines and then my dad would come through

173
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,060
with the BCS and just you know till

174
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,159
through all the beds multiple passes and

175
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,259
my mom would plant and that was the the

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,580
kind of the way that I learned how to

177
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,460
garden

178
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,439
um but as I started gardening and

179
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,599
farming on my own I quickly realized

180
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,418
that like tillage is actually

181
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,180
a I didn't have a rototiller so I had to

182
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,978
rent one they're expensive where I live

183
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,379
um they're loud they're obnoxious I'm

184
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,418
five foot two and weighed at the time

185
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,699
when I started about a you know 120

186
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,799
pounds so trying to mangle one of those

187
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,919
beasts into doing what I wanted it to do

188
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,079
was always a challenge

189
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,180
um so we started looking into no-till

190
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,879
which means you literally do not till

191
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,918
the soil and in a lot of ways it's

192
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,959
really really great we also utilize

193
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,538
Korean natural farming which benefits

194
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,478
from no-till the problem we came into

195
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:30,120
over and over again is that

196
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,758
um number one if you let your soil lay

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,000
fallow or get bare at any point in time

198
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,800
where you're not cultivating crops on it

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,839
our soil gets very hard and compact very

200
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,900
quickly the rain will literally pound

201
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,638
the soil into like a cement brick and at

202
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,098
that point in order to break that up

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,038
again you can do things like broad

204
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:52,860
forking which is basically a big huge

205
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,659
like imagine a giant 4 work that you

206
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,720
pound into the ground and then you lean

207
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,880
back until your soil cracks open and

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,280
it's a way to protect the microbiology

209
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,719
and protect your soil but unfortunately

210
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,279
I again this soil would be so hard I

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,139
literally couldn't even get a broad Fork

212
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,239
into it I'd be jumping up and down on it

213
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,639
and falling over and it just wasn't

214
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,860
wasn't working for us

215
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,319
um so that is an option that is a

216
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,538
no-till situation you can do no-till

217
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,039
lasagna bed methods which is really cool

218
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:25,378
as well if you've got a small square

219
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,538
footage so you can utilize cardboard

220
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,699
which Smothers the weeds it suppresses

221
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:32,338
any weed germination okay and then you

222
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,320
can put compost and soil and things on

223
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,779
top of that and then Mulch on top of

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,479
that and you can plant in that and it's

225
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:42,240
a great way to Garden I've done that in

226
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,320
small scale so you know utilizing maybe

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,959
a

228
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,920
what I guess those beds are three feet

229
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,838
by 20 feet I could do that easily on my

230
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,838
own but it does take a lot of cardboard

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,820
it does take some time and energy and

232
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,740
inevitably because I live out in the

233
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,899
country we have weed seeds that are

234
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,240
constantly blowing back in so I'd have

235
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,240
to redo it basically every year to

236
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,278
smother those weeds out so that wasn't

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,899
working very well for us cover crop is

238
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,799
great to try and suppress the weeds but

239
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,659
inevitably you know our our farm is

240
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,899
um eighteen thousand square feet of

241
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,819
medicinal plants as well as another 2

242
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,980
000 currently for vegetable crops just

243
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,660
on the farm itself we'll be expanding

244
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,039
that out we were trying to expand it

245
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,719
this year but we just didn't have the

246
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,360
time and Manpower

247
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,040
um so you know looking at basically a

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,899
half an acre to three quarters of an

249
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,159
acre hopefully up to an acre by next

250
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,500
year of total cultivated square footage

251
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,899
but that's run by myself my fiance James

252
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,799
and my mom who is 73 years old and we

253
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,159
have 5 kids

254
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,740
so it's a lot to work with just a very

255
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,539
very small amount of people we've

256
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,799
definitely been trying to get people on

257
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,719
board we have a lot of people that come

258
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,639
and volunteer for a few days here and

259
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
there but when you hit those crunch

260
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,139
times of it's time to get the soil

261
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,539
prepped and it's time to get planted we

262
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,720
quickly find that we usually run out of

263
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:10,019
time so what we've turned to that works

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,639
for us is a low till situation so

265
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,259
generally when you're using a tiller

266
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,539
what you're doing is you're actually

267
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,580
cultivating the soil you're turning it

268
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,139
and you're grinding it up and you're

269
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,300
doing that at some pretty deep levels

270
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,059
most tillage recommends like 12 to 18

271
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,338
inches if not deeper that way you get a

272
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,719
really good bed of really soft soil that

273
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,980
your plants don't have to work to get

274
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,080
their Roots through

275
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,180
the problem with this is all the

276
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,620
microbiology that exists in that soil

277
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,479
and hopefully you're working with soil

278
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,539
and not dead dirt so hopefully you have

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,519
a lot of biology in there it gets turned

280
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,199
up to the surface and it gets mangled

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,480
and pulverized and what ends up

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,459
happening is it dies and as that

283
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,920
microbiology dies number one you're

284
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,659
losing diversity of microbiology in your

285
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,699
soil which means that you're losing

286
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,559
plant Health inevitably or you're having

287
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,839
to replace it

288
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,458
um a lot of times people are buying all

289
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,079
these bottles of microbes we call them

290
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,838
bugs in a jug

291
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,120
um and that's great but it's very

292
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,040
limited diversity out in nature you can

293
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,720
pick up a teaspoon of soil and within

294
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,120
that teaspoon of soil there are

295
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,759
literally thousands of different species

296
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,679
of microbiology the best jugs I've come

297
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,838
across have between 20 and 40 species

298
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,139
it's just it's not the same thing at all

299
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,180
so if you've tilled appropriately you've

300
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,419
turned all your microbiology up to the

301
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,519
surface they've died back and the real

302
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:33,899
detriment to this is they have now

303
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,519
actually created carbon dioxide so a lot

304
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,799
of the carbon dioxide that we deal with

305
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,519
nowadays is not coming from driving or

306
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,259
flying or producing tires or things like

307
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,679
that a lot of it is actually industrial

308
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,399
tillage of commercial cultivation of

309
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,419
food

310
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,339
so it's not a great practice on a lot of

311
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,019
levels but what do you do when you have

312
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,640
something that's like okay I have an

313
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,500
acre that I'm running I I don't have an

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
acre worth of cardboard

315
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,159
um I don't like silage tarps and it's

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
not working for me because weed seeds

317
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,000
are blowing in every single time of the

318
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,279
year and if it's not dandelions in the

319
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,919
spring then it's foxtails in the summer

320
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,958
and then it's um lamb's quarter in the

321
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,419
fall and ah what do I do

322
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,278
what we've turned to is what we call low

323
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,500
till so that means that we're not

324
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,059
tilling deep we're not going 12 inches

325
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,059
we're not going 18 inches we're

326
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:26,278
literally just tilting the top inch or

327
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,199
two of the soil this allows us to get

328
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,259
our nutrients in easier so if we're

329
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,240
using something like compost or chicken

330
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:36,120
manure or if we want to put out some

331
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,980
rock dust we can actually incorporate

332
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,459
that into the top layer of the soil

333
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,500
gently it loosens that soil bed so that

334
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,179
our seed bed is nice and soft so that

335
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,399
our plants are easy to transplant if

336
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,078
we're transplanting our seeds are able

337
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,659
to germinate and take root easily if

338
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,759
we're germinating seeds and it also

339
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,620
allows us to cultivate the weed seeds

340
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,019
that have germinated and get them to

341
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,120
basically be tilled back under but

342
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,679
without actually tilling and really

343
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,839
disturbing the soil

344
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,519
that was a rather long explanation of

345
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,980
the differences but you know they're

346
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,259
they're varied and uh vast and that

347
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,659
actually was a short version

348
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,879
no it's really really good to have that

349
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,379
amount of detail I appreciate that so is

350
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,519
it the same piece of equipment you're

351
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:23,838
using for low till we actually purchased

352
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,839
a Kubota tractor last

353
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,019
skin reason I

354
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,839
will scale indigenous microorganism

355
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,778
piles which is a Korean natural farming

356
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,959
methodology but as we went through it

357
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:39,620
turned out they were like oh wow like

358
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:42,000
go figure Farmers really need tractors

359
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,919
they're very very useful for a lot of

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,379
things uh we used it for putting rock

361
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,899
out on the road and uh through that

362
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,958
system I was like you know yes I can

363
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:55,259
rent that BCS rototiller from my local

364
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,119
shop that rents out equipment but that

365
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,799
thing costs I think like 60 bucks a day

366
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,419
we usually need it for at least a week

367
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,759
we're gonna need it a couple times a

368
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,159
year and we can't do things like move

369
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,039
rock around with it so

370
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,958
um so with the Kubota tractor what we

371
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,958
can do is we now we don't actually have

372
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,338
it yet but we're working on getting a

373
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,078
um a couple of attachments on the back

374
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,519
one of them will be a rototiller

375
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,319
attachment

376
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,820
um and they also make

377
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,200
um they make they make a lot of

378
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,240
different equipment for tractors

379
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,000
actually it's kind of amazing if I had

380
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,680
my choice I would probably get something

381
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,320
that is and I can't remember the name of

382
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,539
it right now but there are ones that

383
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,940
actually will fold the soil over rather

384
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,219
than tilling and so it's like a I know

385
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,420
there are different companies not Kubota

386
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,360
specifically

387
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:45,599
um that make they're called bio

388
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,278
some things my friend Sunshine knows

389
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,379
um and those the reason why we would

390
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,879
like that equipment at some point is

391
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,698
because we're planning on doing a dry

392
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,759
farm so dry Farms are farms that have no

393
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,198
irrigation and people are like how okay

394
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,838
wait how do you grow things without

395
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,939
water and it's actually just a

396
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,000
completely different methodology what

397
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,500
you're doing is your

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,240
keeping there's no cover crop there's no

399
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,379
companion plants well you cover crop in

400
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,940
the winter but there's no companion

401
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,820
plants there's nothing growing except

402
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,320
for your cash crops in your soil and

403
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,480
what happens is you end up with like a

404
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,459
dust mulch layer so there's a layer on

405
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,579
the top that's hot and dry and as that

406
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,799
gets hot the just the Tran the way water

407
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,379
Wicks the way it transpires the way it

408
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,359
moves in soil if you have the right soil

409
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:33,299
texture that's key which we happen to

410
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,519
have so that top layer will dry it will

411
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,879
get hot the cool water from below will

412
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,860
be Wicked upwards towards the plants and

413
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,778
what you end up with is a little layer

414
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,278
of hot dry soil and then a layer a

415
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:48,659
really moist beautiful rich soil

416
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:50,639
underneath so this tuner tiller it's

417
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,379
Tata it starts with the T I can't

418
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,579
remember uh whatever this thing is

419
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,980
called

420
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,958
um bio Turner maybe something like that

421
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,000
what it does is it protects your biology

422
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,399
and it just literally flips your soil

423
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
around so it loosens it it aerates it a

424
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,299
little bit but it doesn't actually till

425
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,000
it up so we do want one of those and

426
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:11,939
then for the Farmland that is irrigated

427
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,220
that thing doesn't work as well to my

428
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,320
understanding and so what we'll do is

429
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,519
have the rototiller attachment on the

430
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
back of the tractor that we're just

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,698
going to set your depth so instead of

432
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,220
setting it all the way down where it's

433
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:25,919
tilling 18 inches or so you just set it

434
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,139
so it's just basically just touching the

435
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,278
top of the soil and what that will do is

436
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,198
that will incorporate all those

437
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,078
amendments it'll get rid of all those

438
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,059
weed seeds that have germinated

439
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,099
and it also will allow us to have soil

440
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:41,518
contact with our Korean natural farming

441
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,680
inputs so indigenous microorganisms need

442
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,240
to actually contact the soil so if

443
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,299
you're just spraying it on top of

444
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,480
grasses and things you have it still

445
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,979
works it's just a more limited efficacy

446
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,800
than if you can actually have contact

447
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,180
with the soil itself then of course we

448
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,379
will be

449
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,819
um well I guess you're gonna say of

450
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,799
course because a lot of people don't do

451
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,720
this but then we'll be mulching on top

452
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,818
of that and then the plants go into the

453
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,980
soil through the mulch got it I imagine

454
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,720
for the folks that are tuning in that

455
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,240
are more of a small scale like I have a

456
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,459
lot of Home Growers that grow indoors or

457
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,078
they have small outdoor Gardens if they

458
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,818
were to implement low till they could

459
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,338
probably just use a small hand rake for

460
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,599
example and dig down an inch or two and

461
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,980
I think I imagine a lot of people doing

462
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,859
that when they're top dressing in

463
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,240
organic amendments is their top dressing

464
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,859
but using a small little rake or

465
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,839
something or using their hands to mix

466
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,000
things up on the top so it's kind of

467
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,798
similar to doing that huh yeah it's

468
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,740
basically like scratching it into the

469
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,980
top of the soil there it works it works

470
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,779
out really well a lot of times with home

471
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,179
Growers and with people that are you

472
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,460
know have indoor gardens

473
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,798
um you it's a little different because

474
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,900
you're not working with

475
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,339
living soil so much there's so many

476
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,019
people that are like but I do I have

477
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,459
worms and I'm like and worms are amazing

478
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,139
and they're awesome it's not necessarily

479
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,660
an indicator that you have a functional

480
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,100
soil food web true living soil is a

481
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,140
system that is self-sustaining that

482
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,899
means that you're not adding microbial

483
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,900
activity microbiology every single week

484
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,519
anytime I see a bottle of microbes that

485
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,919
says you need to add this with every

486
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,339
watering my brain goes okay but why

487
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,320
because biology works in the same way

488
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,259
that all life works right is that it

489
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,460
replicates be it through asexual or

490
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,359
sexual

491
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,058
um

492
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,859
uh replication it doesn't matter it

493
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,480
should be doing that so if it's not

494
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,038
doing that there's something wrong with

495
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
this environment and if there's

496
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,740
something wrong with this environment

497
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,418
you're having to keep adding new

498
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,980
populations all the time and this to me

499
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,900
just doesn't make sense like out there

500
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,779
in nature nobody's going out there and

501
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,679
adding bacillus species to the forest

502
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:48,359
every single week right so if you're if

503
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,720
you're trying to get a biologically

504
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,219
active soil your big takeaway here is

505
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,440
you're not going to do it with potting

506
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,019
soil you're not going to do it with a

507
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,200
soilless medium and most potting soil is

508
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:03,019
pretty junky most compost that you buy

509
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,120
commercially is pretty junky like

510
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:07,679
Municipal compost is full of pesticides

511
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,359
and herbicides because there's no check

512
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,538
and balance anybody who wants to put

513
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,918
green waste into a municipal composting

514
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:16,740
facility they just send their green

515
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,140
waste off and you have no recourse on or

516
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,700
no knowledge even of what was put on

517
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,038
those plants before they went into that

518
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,919
facility most composting facilities

519
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,919
don't use biology they just use heat and

520
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,880
pressure and turning and oxygenation

521
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
which is great for breaking down

522
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,660
material but truthfully it doesn't

523
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,538
mitigate anything that's in there so if

524
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,220
there's poisons or herbicides or even

525
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,440
excess fertilizer it's not really

526
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,600
getting broken down and that composting

527
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,759
process now when you start adding

528
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,339
biology it's a whole different world

529
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,440
there are amazing studies that I read

530
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,379
all the time about how different fungal

531
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,900
species and different bacterial species

532
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,820
have the ability to actually mitigate

533
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,340
things like you know oil spills we've

534
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,500
heard about that for years right there's

535
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:05,038
ones now that are showing that they're

536
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,960
mitigating heavy metals so toxic heavy

537
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,460
metals like cadmium and arsenic are a

538
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,500
lot of problem in a lot of native soils

539
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,720
what do you do about it well if you have

540
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,500
an extremely diverse microbiological

541
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,079
population that has lots of fungi lots

542
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,700
of bacteria lots of you know amoeba and

543
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,399
nematodes and everything you need to

544
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,919
show that you have a functional soil

545
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,320
food web you're gonna probably or

546
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,059
possibly I don't know you know there's

547
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,678
the jury is still out on that one what

548
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:33,058
the probability is

549
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,200
um but there's a good likelihood that

550
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,178
you have something that can actually

551
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,980
start mitigating those heavy metals and

552
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,660
they'll tie it up in their body or

553
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,099
they'll chelate it and actually make it

554
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,500
into a compound that's not a

555
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,959
bioavailable to the plants it's just

556
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,519
cool cool cool amazing stuff

557
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,079
um and again that has more to do with

558
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,779
people that are growing outside in

559
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,240
native soil than people that are inside

560
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,639
um but even for people that are inside

561
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,620
they're like well I mean I don't want to

562
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,360
bring the outside inside like I have

563
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,538
this nice sterile environment that I

564
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,839
think I'm you know able to to kind of

565
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:09,480
keep in its little bubble and again it's

566
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,480
not it's not really the way plants grow

567
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,298
you know you have a limited cycle with

568
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,160
your potting soil inside

569
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,519
um you know I we used to grow inside

570
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,538
back in the day in Humboldt County a lot

571
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:28,019
and we basically at some point the norm

572
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:30,179
became to take out your dirt every time

573
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,339
you planted a new plant so you'd remove

574
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,980
all your soil and you bring in all new

575
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,859
bags of soil and at some point I was

576
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,019
just like okay this is this is silly

577
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,219
this feels really silly to me like my

578
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,139
garden loved it because it got fresh

579
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,120
topsoil or fresh potting soil all the

580
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,419
time made my heavy clay much more

581
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,739
aerated and light uh but I was like you

582
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,640
know I'm tired of doing all this work

583
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,380
we're gonna do something different we're

584
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
just gonna reuse our soil so we'll just

585
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,679
add compost and some amendments like we

586
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,079
would outside and we'll just see how

587
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,940
that goes and it worked really well for

588
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,798
a while and then what I found was that

589
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,120
and we still we actually moved into beds

590
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,918
and we did bring in a little tiny

591
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,538
rototiller like a little mantis thing so

592
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,840
you would like ring and turn everything

593
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:11,940
around and you'd till it up and um what

594
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,658
we found is that pretty soon your soil

595
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,120
texture turns into dust it turns into

596
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,740
garbage you lose all the good texture

597
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,359
that's in that soil it gets really

598
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,058
compacted plants start getting really

599
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,399
unhappy and I was like huh

600
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:29,399
okay so potting soil is not like regular

601
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,559
outside soil this is when you look at it

602
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,480
it's pretty obvious but you know

603
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,279
experientially especially as a young

604
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,380
person that was growing up doing a lot

605
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,058
of gardening and a lot of farming of

606
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,799
medicinal plants that aren't you know

607
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,000
widely talked about

608
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:43,740
um or that weren't widely talked about

609
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,940
at the time it was like you didn't you

610
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,859
didn't really know what you were doing

611
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,259
wrong you were just experiencing things

612
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,959
and realizing that like oh after you

613
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:54,359
know doing this four or five times it's

614
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,579
not working anymore so why would that be

615
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,379
what's different from outside and you

616
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,538
know kind of looking back and forth and

617
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,299
being like ah you know different organic

618
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:05,400
matter different starting material and

619
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,679
so then we started incorporating native

620
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,298
soil back in so we'd actually go and dig

621
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,880
buckets up out of the garden and bring

622
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:14,240
those inside and realized very quickly

623
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,500
that you could actually kind of

624
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
rehabilitate that potting soil if you

625
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,400
are if you will like we'd bring in wood

626
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,100
chips and Duff from the forest and you

627
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,298
know different we we started mulching we

628
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:29,279
weren't mulching at the time we didn't

629
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,720
mulch inside because I don't know why

630
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,000
would you I didn't really know what I

631
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,440
was you know soil science wasn't such a

632
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,179
thing when I was in my like you know

633
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,340
early 20s

634
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,200
um or maybe it wasn't I just didn't know

635
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,839
about it maybe I wasn't such a soil nerd

636
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,460
that's very possible

637
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,678
but we started mulching so we were

638
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,019
protecting that layer of our soil and

639
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,000
then as we would you know gently turn it

640
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,980
in on the next round it added organic

641
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,319
material to the soil itself which added

642
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,860
to the soil structure you know looking

643
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:01,259
back on it now I'm like man I wish I had

644
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:04,139
somebody like me to tell me how to do it

645
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,119
you know back then rather than doing all

646
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,340
of this trial and error over years and

647
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,139
years of being like why is this so

648
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,399
different I don't understand and why are

649
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,080
we having to like why are we having so

650
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,519
many pest issues like I don't have

651
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:16,019
problems like this outside why do I have

652
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,639
this inside I know it's more protected

653
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,980
but still there's got to be more to it

654
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,080
than this we have certainly come a long

655
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,900
way and things are a lot easier now with

656
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,418
the knowledge we have today versus five

657
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,280
years ago 10 years ago and so on and so

658
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,500
forth it's just it's incredible the

659
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,538
amount of knowledge that uh is circling

660
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,640
around there in the community and people

661
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,879
are implementing in their Gardens today

662
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,880
it's wild so going back to low till so

663
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,700
you you've low tilled your soil

664
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,380
are you doing anything else to prepare

665
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,140
for planting like some people add in

666
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,760
amendments or compost some people will

667
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,679
plant a cover crop and then grow their

668
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,379
plants with it are you doing anything

669
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,620
else preparing the soil for planting

670
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,480
um yes so we basically want to have

671
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:03,298
something growing in our soil at all

672
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,779
times ideally it's not our native

673
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:09,418
grasses because they seed readily and

674
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,859
frequently and they have deep roots and

675
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,059
they're just really difficult they

676
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,519
outgrow everything they're they're

677
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:16,740
difficult to deal with so

678
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,179
um in the winter time we have it I we we

679
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,700
missed our little window we just had

680
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,620
some rain up here so I was trying to get

681
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,679
out to actually do our cover crop in the

682
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,599
areas that we have already

683
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,778
harvested but we didn't quite get to

684
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,359
that we did we've done living mulch at

685
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:35,940
different times this year we really like

686
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,459
to have Mulch on our soil so it's the

687
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,700
easiest way for people to kind of keep

688
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,798
soil covered and not have to worry about

689
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,720
um cultivating or taking care of

690
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,359
something or you know weeding all the

691
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,419
time if you just do a super heavy thick

692
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,178
layer of mulch Alfalfa organic Alfalfa

693
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,580
is really the jam it is amazing you'll

694
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,179
actually see the residual benefits the

695
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,439
next year of that organic Alfalfa

696
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,538
unfortunately organic Alfalfa is

697
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,880
apparently next to impossible to find so

698
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:08,759
if you are trying to mulch 18 000 square

699
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,320
feet with Organic Alfalfa you need these

700
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,720
very very large Bales they weigh about

701
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,538
500 pounds and we usually use about six

702
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,860
we usually use um about 10 to 12 of them

703
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:18,778
per year

704
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,579
and we couldn't get any this year there

705
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,919
was none to be had I mean I was calling

706
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,899
from California I was calling Arizona I

707
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,179
was calling Nevada I was calling Oregon

708
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,059
Washington up into Idaho and I couldn't

709
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,220
find anybody that didn't that had

710
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,139
organic Alfalfa available for purchase

711
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,360
they were all have been contracted out

712
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,679
so something's going on with like the

713
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,439
dairy industry I guess or animal

714
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,538
husbandry that people are really moving

715
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,759
towards needing that organic Alfalfa for

716
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,819
animal feed so it's not available for

717
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,079
Farmers like me to use for mulch so this

718
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,178
year we tried

719
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,319
um living mulch which is basically a

720
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,900
short growing plant that grows

721
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,240
underneath your your cash crop and it

722
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,298
keeps your soil from being bare so we

723
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,759
had limited success with that

724
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:05,940
um part of the problem was by the time I

725
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,519
gave up on finding Alfalfa uh we were

726
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,080
well into summertime so all the seed

727
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,400
that we put out didn't germinate very

728
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,240
well because it was too hot and dry

729
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,880
already

730
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,740
so you know we and we've had years where

731
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,140
it's very successful and we've had years

732
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,839
like this where it wasn't

733
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,820
um so luckily in a way we don't have to

734
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,918
worry about a living mulch that we have

735
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,960
to contend with trying to save I've had

736
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,059
years where I literally would dig it up

737
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,880
and move it out of the way because once

738
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:36,058
you add cover crop that generally grows

739
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,278
tall and High and

740
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,778
um you have to cut it down so if you're

741
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,339
growing cover crop and you're chopping

742
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:43,140
it down you're living mulch is now being

743
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,939
smothered out so if you're gonna have

744
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,700
living Mulch and cover crop you're gonna

745
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,140
have to remove your living mulch uh and

746
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,120
my living mulches generally don't

747
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,400
overwinter they die back I'm back at

748
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:58,739
that problem of having bare soil again

749
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:02,400
so we will as soon as we can plant a um

750
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,740
a cover crop my preferred cover crop is

751
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,440
a mixture of legumes so different peas

752
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,900
and like fava beans and things like that

753
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,320
um and some veg there's a lot of like

754
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,900
winter Rye that people add and grasses

755
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,939
um for us I'm not a huge fan of the

756
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,100
grasses as much we don't need to break

757
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,720
up any compaction layers so some of

758
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,339
those grasses have really really deep

759
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,038
roots they're really good for heavy

760
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:28,379
thick soil but our soil has been

761
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:32,700
cultivated now for

762
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:36,659
um I think the the most recent Garden is

763
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,220
a running on eight years now oh gosh

764
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,980
maybe more than that

765
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,400
somewhere around in that range and then

766
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,400
the oldest Garden is about 15 years of

767
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,440
that same soil being taken care of and

768
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,679
being built every year so it's it's got

769
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,100
beautiful texture it's nice and loose we

770
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,140
do amend every year we did not send out

771
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,359
for soil test this year but I do

772
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,340
recommend you do test your soil just so

773
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,019
you kind of have an idea of Baseline of

774
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:06,240
what's there what kind of macronutrients

775
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,879
are available or present what kind of

776
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,259
micronutrients are present and that can

777
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
help you just kind of decide what you

778
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:18,119
want to amend with if you want to amend

779
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:21,359
I am a I'm gonna go against the grain of

780
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,158
um what people are frequently told

781
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,379
um if you pay any attention to people

782
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,720
like Dr Elaine Ingham

783
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,299
um and a lot of the wonderful

784
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,860
regenerative scientists and

785
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,079
um people that that advocate for

786
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,699
regenerative agriculture they're all

787
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,319
phenomenal and I love them to death I

788
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,740
think they're amazing and super smart

789
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,778
but experientially I have not had the

790
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,940
experience that they say which is that

791
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:47,640
everything that you need in the soil is

792
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,220
present in the soil that has not been

793
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,380
what I've noticed at all we are

794
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,659
generally very nitrogen deficient if we

795
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,179
don't add nitrogen to our soil or else

796
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,799
I'm having to constantly feed my plants

797
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,600
all the time and I'd rather put it in at

798
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,339
the beginning and have it be there in

799
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,740
the soil so that the plants have access

800
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,778
to it when they need it rather than me

801
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,240
dictating when I think the plant needs

802
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,278
it usually by the time I notice a

803
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,500
deficiency even if it's super early on

804
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,538
the plant is like yeah I've been

805
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,759
starving for like two weeks thanks for

806
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:19,500
finally feeding me so if I make sure

807
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,940
they're in the soil then I don't have to

808
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,159
worry about that I can take that kind of

809
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,019
off my plate and and not have it be a

810
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,539
concern I think one of the main things

811
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,460
that gets kind of missed is certain

812
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,919
crops especially our medicinal herbs

813
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,200
we're removing the entire plant we're

814
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,059
not just removing the fruit so if you

815
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,880
have a tomato and you're just taking the

816
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:40,798
tomato fruit off you're removing that

817
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,360
nutrient all the nutrients and minerals

818
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,460
that it took to make that fruit have

819
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,939
disappeared but if you leave the plant

820
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,159
itself all of the leaves will Decay your

821
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,019
Vines will Decay they'll add they'll add

822
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,360
to your soil and anything that that

823
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:56,519
plant utilized from the soil will be

824
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,079
returned to the soil but if you have a

825
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,418
medicinal plant and you're taking the

826
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,278
whole thing out you're removing all the

827
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,500
nutrients that that plant accumulated

828
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,000
over the course of its life from the

829
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,079
soil that means you're going to have to

830
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,778
replace it

831
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:13,558
so for us again nitrogen's the big one

832
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:16,740
we prefer organic manures we prefer

833
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,359
organic alfalfa meal when I can find it

834
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,759
um some crustacean meals and things are

835
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:23,459
really really great and then we usually

836
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,019
do rock dust every year ideally I'd like

837
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,659
to get enough Rock Dust to do it once

838
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,480
every 20 years but that would be like a

839
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,220
lot of rock dust Rock Dust has all of

840
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,659
your trace minerals and micro Newton not

841
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,399
all of but most of your trace minerals

842
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,559
and micronutrients that your plants need

843
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,658
we usually do some oyster shell that

844
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,879
adds to our calcium which tends to get

845
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,278
depleted rather rapidly with the crops

846
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,679
that we farm

847
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,778
and earthworm castings

848
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,580
um if you're working with fallow soil or

849
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:53,640
native soil that hasn't ever been

850
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:56,278
utilized before all as many earthworms

851
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,520
castings as you can afford is great it

852
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,980
adds biology instantly it's

853
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,599
once you're getting rolling you don't

854
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,460
need to add as much or you don't need to

855
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,959
add as much every year you can kind of

856
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,759
go you know when you're on when you're

857
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,740
off type of thing

858
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,298
um what else do we put in there I think

859
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,339
that's kind of the majority of it and

860
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:17,639
then we do Korean natural farming so

861
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:20,278
that's really our big ticket item so our

862
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,278
you know do this one thing to get the

863
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:24,659
most out of it is going to be indigenous

864
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:26,940
microorganisms so I've mentioned that a

865
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,740
few times we shorten it I I laugh a lot

866
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,659
because in k f it's like oh we have more

867
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,240
acronyms than the Navy Seals Everything

868
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,539
is acronym acronymized I don't know if

869
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,500
that's where it is now uh

870
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:42,898
so IMO indigenous microorganism and what

871
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,460
that is is you're going out into nature

872
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:46,739
you're finding areas that are

873
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,419
undisturbed so we're talking you know

874
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,940
it's not

875
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,020
um it's not your backyard okay it's not

876
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,159
your garden that you've already been

877
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,079
cultivating it's definitely not your

878
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,880
compost pile people really like look at

879
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,460
my IMO from my compost pile I'm like

880
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,559
that's compost microorganism it's not

881
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,700
indigenous microorganism it's a whole

882
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:04,918
different thing

883
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,200
and the reason why we want to go out

884
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,480
into undisturbed areas is because it has

885
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,038
the most biodiversity so what we're

886
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,960
trying to do is capture as much

887
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,819
diversity as we can in these collections

888
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,860
we're trying to do it as often as we can

889
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:19,558
from as many different subtle locations

890
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,839
so our farm I have an oak tree that I

891
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,178
love it's right on the edge of a field I

892
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,199
get great collections from that but I

893
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,419
also want to have a collection

894
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,278
underneath the Bay Tree which has a

895
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,480
different

896
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,398
microbiological community living under

897
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,079
it I also want to do under a tan Oak

898
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,199
which is again another one and then we

899
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,599
have fur trees we have maple trees where

900
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,880
I live we have Live Oak we have we have

901
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,918
a lot of trees in California so that

902
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,100
means that that diversity under the soil

903
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,620
mimics the diversity above the soil so I

904
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:52,379
have a lot of diversity in my indigenous

905
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,219
microorganism collections then what I'm

906
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,260
doing

907
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,600
is I'm taking all of those I'm

908
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,480
inoculating out and culturing a

909
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:03,058
large-scale pile that is comprised of

910
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,980
carbon and carbohydrates and what we're

911
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,440
doing is we're really trying to Peg food

912
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,019
for fungi so we want all of the

913
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,700
mushroomy type things all the mycelium

914
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:13,619
that's running through the forest I want

915
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,939
to say you should come to my garden you

916
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,019
should come live with my plants my

917
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,940
plants and you guys would get along

918
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:20,878
really well I think and and it's not

919
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,220
there in native soil quite often it's in

920
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,019
our deciduous trees and it's in our old

921
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,059
growth forests

922
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,559
um obviously I'm not going to dig up all

923
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,000
the dirt in the old growth forest to

924
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,559
move to my farm because then I would be

925
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,320
killing my old growth forest and I don't

926
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,659
want to do that so we culture it on a

927
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,419
bed of rice we take that Rice we then

928
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,940
have like 10 to 12 of those culture rice

929
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,158
cultures that all have different biology

930
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,740
in them we inoculated out into this

931
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,300
carbon and carbohydrate substrate and

932
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,638
what that does is that's the perfect

933
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,679
food for fungi specifically you also

934
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,119
have bacteria terrestrial yeast so all

935
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,019
that being said

936
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,780
um obviously you know to increase the

937
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:03,300
um the soil Health that we have on the

938
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,960
farm indigenous microorganisms or IMO is

939
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,880
our very best friend so every year well

940
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,920
or every other year give or take what we

941
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,180
try to do is make sure that we are

942
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,280
adding more of those indigenous

943
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,618
microorganisms this is an ongoing

944
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,960
process like it doesn't ever stop so I'm

945
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,660
always doing IMO one which is that

946
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,519
initial collection from the forest and

947
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:26,879
every year I'm trying to make that into

948
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,099
im03 which is many many IMO 2

949
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,320
collections which is the stabilized form

950
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:36,059
of im01 and then I'm taking that imo3

951
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,519
marrying it with my garden soil and then

952
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,259
broadcasting that out I usually don't go

953
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,599
all the way to im05 just because I don't

954
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,060
generally have a lot of time so the

955
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,300
compost or the manure that we use will

956
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:51,539
just go kind of on top or again be low

957
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,000
tilled in now the one thing that k f

958
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:57,119
really works well with no-till

959
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,760
situations is because you're not

960
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,519
tearing apart those fungal hyphae you're

961
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,320
not exposing that microbiology and

962
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,420
therefore you're not having to add it as

963
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,760
often with what we're doing with the low

964
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,338
till situation we know that that first

965
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,859
few inches of soil is going to end up

966
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:16,019
being you know not so happy it's going

967
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:17,759
to have biology that's dying back and

968
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,059
that's why we want to add it back with

969
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,160
the IMO so you know the great thing

970
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,639
about IMO is that you really don't need

971
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,039
a lot you do need a decent amount but

972
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,980
it's not like you know hundreds of

973
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:35,099
thousands of pounds or anything

974
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,039
I believe that the standard application

975
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,099
rate is three

976
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,179
thousand pounds per acre if I recall

977
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,579
correctly I always have to go to my

978
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,679
notes but in general where I'm at now is

979
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,900
that we just want to every year try and

980
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,179
make a two thousand to five thousand

981
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,700
pound pile and then just broadcast that

982
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:55,858
out over whatever square footage we're

983
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:57,899
using you really can't overdo it either

984
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:00,659
which is a nice thing about im03 and

985
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,820
im04 is that um

986
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:05,460
it's not like chicken manure where it's

987
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,260
hot so if you put it in there you might

988
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,440
overdo it and kill all your plants you

989
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:13,020
could literally grow in just im04 if you

990
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,338
wanted to it would be a lot of work and

991
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,900
I don't know that I would necessarily

992
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:18,539
recommend it because you don't have to

993
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,300
do that and again a part of a part of

994
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:24,539
Korean natural farming is utilizing as

995
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,700
little as you can for the most efficacy

996
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:29,039
so the biggest bang for your buck for

997
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:31,679
the least amount of work because as a

998
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,480
gardener or a farmer you have a ton of

999
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,358
other things that you have to do in any

1000
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:40,079
given hour so if I can do something that

1001
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:42,900
has you know a percent success rate of

1002
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,820
you know 80 percent I want to focus on

1003
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,980
that one thing and that for us is

1004
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,720
indigenous microorganisms

1005
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,280
um the benefit another benefit that we

1006
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,279
haven't even touched on yet is pest

1007
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,680
resistance so we have plants that will

1008
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,740
come into us from nurseries and things

1009
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:03,199
and from other other sources that will

1010
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:06,598
have like aphids or mites of some kind

1011
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,399
and for the most part or thrips is

1012
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,380
another great one that plants love to

1013
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,519
they love to hitchhike in on you and

1014
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,900
everything that comes to you and uh what

1015
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,519
we found is once we plant them in the

1016
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,858
garden like they'll they'll the

1017
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,338
population will Boom for a minute and

1018
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:25,799
then it just dies back naturally we also

1019
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:28,619
have access to open air like again we're

1020
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,660
outside not inside so if you're inside I

1021
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,400
don't know that this works quite as well

1022
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:35,338
there's a lot of people that are

1023
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,559
espousing that if you have a healthy

1024
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:40,799
enough plant it is pest resistant

1025
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,500
naturally and while I agree with that to

1026
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,720
a certain extent it's kind of impossible

1027
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,639
to know how healthy your Healthy plant

1028
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,059
has to be what looks healthy to us might

1029
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,279
not be truly 100 Optimal Health I also

1030
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:55,500
know that like with human beings

1031
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,859
um the only people that are at Optimal

1032
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Health are people that are you know

1033
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:04,078
a have the amazing genetics that they

1034
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,940
have and B are extremely high level

1035
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,560
athletes that are watching their diet

1036
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,079
and they're exercising and they're being

1037
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,119
very careful most of us are not at that

1038
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,220
level I don't think most plants are at

1039
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,920
that level either I I think that it

1040
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:20,098
doesn't really matter how

1041
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,320
healthy your plant looks to you there is

1042
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,599
probably some amount of weakness in it

1043
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,780
and so therefore once pests take hold

1044
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,820
especially if you're inside it's near

1045
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,560
impossible to get rid of them if you're

1046
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,900
outside

1047
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,519
um again it's a little different we

1048
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,139
don't have this beautiful environment

1049
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,119
that's all protected and there's no

1050
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:41,699
natural predators that can come in and

1051
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,400
you know the pests just love that you

1052
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,618
put thrips in an inside garden and they

1053
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,740
just you know go Richter you put spider

1054
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:51,480
mites in an inside Garden or aphids and

1055
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:52,979
if there's no predators in there and

1056
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,320
there's no wind to knock them down and

1057
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,320
there's no rain to wash them off there

1058
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,720
they get to be pretty difficult even in

1059
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,579
a really really healthy soil system so

1060
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,519
that's why we have IPM integrated Pest

1061
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,560
Management it's integrated Pest

1062
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:10,920
Management not integrated pest

1063
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:12,659
eradication so if you're inside even if

1064
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,880
you're practicing living soil technique

1065
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:18,960
and Korean natural farming you know

1066
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,000
you're gonna find less bugs probably but

1067
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,159
it's not necessarily going to eradicate

1068
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,260
them 100 percent and you may need to

1069
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,239
stay on top of some type of preventative

1070
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,220
maintenance even if it's just bio

1071
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,919
control so if you have Healthy Living

1072
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,199
soil it's well mulched and covered

1073
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,940
you've got microbiology that's extremely

1074
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,759
diverse you've got a really really

1075
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,619
healthy plant you're probably okay with

1076
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,839
just monthly releases of Bio control

1077
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,420
agents so those would be Predators for

1078
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,980
your pests so if you notice you have a

1079
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,260
couple spider mites you're going to get

1080
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,820
a predatory Mite if you notice you have

1081
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,040
a couple aphids you're going to get some

1082
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,160
green lace Wing larvae so these are

1083
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,079
things that you can use inside that can

1084
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,879
mitigate problems before they become

1085
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,700
super problematic

1086
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,619
outside again I don't really do any of

1087
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:07,919
that we just plant them in the dirt and

1088
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,300
we allow them to grow for you know

1089
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,099
usually it's somewhere in the two to

1090
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,039
three weeks and we'll watch the

1091
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:15,300
population just get decimated and part

1092
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,739
of that I think is that the plants

1093
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,960
become stronger and healthier they have

1094
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,299
access to more nutrients their cellular

1095
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,280
walls get thicker which makes it harder

1096
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,680
for sap sucking insects to pierce them

1097
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,900
and get into that sap

1098
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,399
um and then we also have access to the

1099
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,920
wind and the rain and the natural

1100
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,838
predators that are there but again

1101
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,780
Korean natural farming has that

1102
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,358
microbiology diversity that diversity of

1103
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,280
soil biology allows those plants to

1104
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,440
uptake nutrients that are harder to get

1105
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,060
normally that allows it for it to be a

1106
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,980
stronger healthier plant a lot of people

1107
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:49,380
what they'll do is they'll resort to

1108
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,300
sprays as a preventative are you doing

1109
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,338
any type of sprays in order to prevent

1110
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,079
pests are you like avoiding spraying

1111
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,599
your plants

1112
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,339
um we avoid spraying unless we're fully

1113
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,960
you're feeding we want to foliar feed

1114
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:02,880
our plants that's something that we do

1115
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,400
when they are not producing fruits or

1116
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,800
flowers yet once they start producing

1117
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,440
fruits and flowers we tend to avoid away

1118
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,359
from that especially our medicinal herb

1119
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,740
plants those ones we really don't want

1120
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:15,539
once they're once they're in their

1121
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,179
production stage we don't want to be

1122
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:18,779
spraying anything on them at all

1123
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:21,419
um

1124
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,880
that being said you know there is

1125
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,858
something called jwa or chadam wedding

1126
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,420
agent which is a homemade soap basically

1127
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:31,259
and we found that it mitigates just

1128
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:34,200
about everything so there's a Mite HRM

1129
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,060
mites that are out there those who know

1130
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:38,519
and if you know you know it's really

1131
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:41,460
really difficult to combat we found

1132
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,780
wonderful success with just jwh and I'm

1133
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,000
wetting agent

1134
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,280
um it's just it you have to be on top of

1135
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,920
it you've got to do it every third day

1136
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,440
for three weeks is my protocol for that

1137
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,300
one and it does have pretty much almost

1138
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,159
full eradication and then you have

1139
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,720
Predator insects that you bring in to

1140
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,019
kind of do the mop up of anybody that

1141
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:04,259
you might have missed but as far as you

1142
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:06,539
know IPM sprays it's

1143
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,700
um if you can avoid it and if you can

1144
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,460
get plants that are super healthy and

1145
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,858
happy and not have to do that and just

1146
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,159
use bio control it is a much better

1147
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:19,440
process to go down but if you are not

1148
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,719
paying attention and you have of a

1149
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,760
population explosion of pests you're

1150
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,899
gonna have to use knockback spray once

1151
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,599
they get past the point where you're

1152
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,039
like oh shoot I have bugs it's too late

1153
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,380
Predator insects are not going to do the

1154
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,059
job for you it doesn't matter I mean I

1155
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,140
know people that say that they have done

1156
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:38,818
like massive releases of like um

1157
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:41,219
californicus or Swarovski which are

1158
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:44,759
different mites predatory mites and been

1159
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:47,639
able to mitigate pest problems I myself

1160
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,920
have tried that and not had that success

1161
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,440
I know a lot of other Growers that have

1162
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,599
not had that success and they're

1163
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,179
expensive so you've also got a problem

1164
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,640
if you did not identify your pest

1165
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:01,500
correctly and you did not release the

1166
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,118
right predator for it you've now wasted

1167
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,420
a lot of money on predators that are not

1168
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,180
specific to that pest so knockback spray

1169
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,760
of a simple soap is a really really good

1170
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:15,539
way to go if you have to but again

1171
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,220
ideally your you know your your your IPM

1172
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,599
your integrated Pest Management is that

1173
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:20,639
you're managing your pests before they

1174
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,220
even get there so you have predators

1175
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,659
prevalent and ready to fight if they

1176
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:26,399
show up

1177
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,920
um and you have a healthy enough plant

1178
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,380
that if they show up they're like this

1179
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,539
is maybe too hard I might hitchhike back

1180
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,220
out to something that's you know easier

1181
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,139
easier victims out there in the

1182
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:39,118
neighborhood got it yeah if you can

1183
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,279
avoid those sprays it can certainly save

1184
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,480
a ton of time I mean I know people who

1185
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,420
are spraying their plants every single

1186
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,500
week religiously just to prevent you

1187
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,960
know they aren't even battling

1188
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,579
infestation but uh yeah if you can get

1189
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,559
to a point where you don't have to spray

1190
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,539
on a weekly basis you can save a ton of

1191
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,818
time doing that now one thing that we

1192
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:58,380
didn't get into really that kind of

1193
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:01,679
relates to all this is companion

1194
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,079
planting I love my companion plants so

1195
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,759
companion planting so there's there's

1196
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,579
two terminologies and they're kind of

1197
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,460
used Loosely and interchangeably but in

1198
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:13,318
my mind they shouldn't be so you have a

1199
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,539
cover crop which is really meant to

1200
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,420
cover your soil when you don't have a

1201
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:20,400
crop in so that's that was the the first

1202
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,519
definition of these was cover crops were

1203
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,440
put in in the fall and it covered the

1204
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,059
soil so that in and a lot of it were

1205
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,318
winter die backs so if you live in a

1206
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,838
place where it's really cold you can put

1207
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,940
a winter Rye in and it will grow it will

1208
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,980
nice and big and then as the freeze

1209
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,838
comes it will die back but it'll turn

1210
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,000
into its own layer of mulch it's a

1211
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,460
really easy way to just you know have

1212
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,079
both mulching and covering at the same

1213
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,358
time so

1214
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,500
um for People Like Us in California that

1215
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,838
doesn't work so well because we don't

1216
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,460
have killing Frost so things don't die

1217
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,380
back very well

1218
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,300
um so that's your cover crop and then

1219
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,980
your companion plant is just what it

1220
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,480
sounds like it's a plant that is company

1221
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:02,760
for your cash crops so companion plants

1222
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,440
are amazing there is a big bean here

1223
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,300
hello buddy

1224
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,519
um companion plants are amazing for a

1225
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,079
lot of reasons one of the things I

1226
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,338
really love about companion plants is

1227
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,760
that different plants have different

1228
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:16,559
microbial interactions in the soil so if

1229
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,140
you have a more increased plant

1230
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,838
diversity above the soil you have a more

1231
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:24,719
increased microbiological diversity

1232
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:27,059
under the soil that means that if your

1233
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,858
plant has different communities it likes

1234
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:30,599
to hang out with there's a greater

1235
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:32,759
chance of those communities being there

1236
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,660
and staying alive with other plants

1237
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,339
being there and Alive as well so um

1238
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,338
companion plants we've used in the past

1239
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:43,559
we've used food crops I've used

1240
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:46,799
watermelon and cucumber I do not

1241
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,318
recommend you use a Vine as a companion

1242
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,000
plant because it can strangle your cash

1243
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,460
crops

1244
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,179
um that being said I tend to break all

1245
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,460
the rules on my own because I can I

1246
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:01,318
guess or because I want to see

1247
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,300
um some of those have been very very bad

1248
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,699
choices like letting my kids plant bird

1249
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,519
seed wild bird seed turned into Millet

1250
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:11,039
which has turned into a five-year issue

1251
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,920
I can't get rid of it I always miss some

1252
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,599
it set seeds really easily also led to

1253
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,760
me discovering though that it makes a

1254
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,380
really great mulch so if you can get

1255
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,380
your Millet out there you can buy bird

1256
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,440
seed literally for bird seed it's very

1257
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,780
cheap right and you can spread it and

1258
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,940
you'll generally have Millet

1259
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,099
um possibly some amaranth and some

1260
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,900
sunflowers and all of those are

1261
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,059
wonderful plants to have in your garden

1262
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,740
if you can make sure that you your

1263
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:39,659
Millet doesn't take takeover Millet has

1264
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:42,118
really really deep roots so it's really

1265
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,920
hard to get it out of the ground it

1266
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,838
comes back from the crown really easily

1267
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,400
it moves through the rhizosphere very

1268
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,880
easily so it'll actually send out like

1269
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,160
roots that will pop up new Millet plants

1270
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,838
um so if you've got a small gardening

1271
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,279
space I don't recommend it but if you

1272
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:58,019
have a large gardening space you might

1273
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,240
dedicate part of it to just be Millet

1274
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:03,119
you can go and cut it down and have your

1275
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,098
own mulch really easily that way but

1276
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,480
again not not your best companion plant

1277
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,539
either

1278
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,980
um which was what I originally let my

1279
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:12,779
kids do I was like yeah this is your

1280
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,240
area do whatever you want well it's kind

1281
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,400
of started taking over other areas

1282
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,500
um so Millet not your best choice for a

1283
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,318
companion plant may be a good choice for

1284
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,760
a cover crop dependent

1285
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,099
um but what is good then so something

1286
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,859
that grows low purslane fabulous

1287
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:30,838
fabulous cover crop companion plant it

1288
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,519
will cover your soil it will last

1289
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:35,279
through the winter it will reseed it

1290
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,559
will come back and it grows for the most

1291
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,440
part fairly low to the soil up to about

1292
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:44,400
six to eight inches so if you have a

1293
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,318
cash crop or a herbal medicinal plant

1294
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,019
that grows very tall you can easily

1295
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,639
utilize that and it's a it's a really

1296
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:54,539
easy one it doesn't take any management

1297
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,578
whatsoever it generally likes

1298
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:58,679
um you know it can handle drought

1299
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:02,760
tolerant not super drought tolerant but

1300
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,559
it does okay in low water situations if

1301
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,359
you do a low-till situation you can

1302
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,880
literally till it under and it'll come

1303
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:10,920
back from its seeds the next year so

1304
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,838
it's it's a fun one

1305
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,940
um what else have we done I've tried

1306
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,739
beets which didn't turn out very well

1307
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,579
there wasn't enough sunlight underneath

1308
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,838
so that didn't companion plant well

1309
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:23,940
marigolds people talk about a lot

1310
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,519
because they think that it has a natural

1311
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,800
pyrethrin in it which is a pest

1312
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,059
deterrent but most of the marigolds that

1313
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,280
people plant are not the ones that

1314
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:33,659
actually contain that and it might not

1315
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,859
be the pyrethrin actually now that I

1316
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,019
think about it might be something else I

1317
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,900
don't I don't quite recall but it's only

1318
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:42,780
french marigolds it's a very specific

1319
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:45,180
strain or cultivar of Marigold that has

1320
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,339
that and I haven't noticed it to

1321
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:48,719
necessarily work that well that being

1322
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:50,159
said I do love marigolds they're

1323
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,719
absolutely gorgeous and I use them as a

1324
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,960
companion plant every year I love

1325
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:57,239
petunias what do they do for me well you

1326
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,338
know they maybe increase the diversity

1327
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,039
in the soil because it's a petunia but

1328
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:03,119
nothing really grows

1329
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,880
petunias will take over their area

1330
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,818
they're they're literally so

1331
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,858
um prolific with their foliage and their

1332
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:12,719
flowers that they'll they'll take

1333
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:14,699
everything that they can and nothing

1334
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,799
else can grow underneath them but

1335
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,899
they're easy to care for they're super

1336
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,119
pretty I don't know how good of a

1337
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,460
pollinator they are I don't usually see

1338
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,140
my pollinators on my petunias I usually

1339
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:28,980
see them on the dandelions that are

1340
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:31,679
right next to the petunias so um as far

1341
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,960
as a pollinator companion goes not sure

1342
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:36,719
that one's your best bet

1343
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,599
um we've used lamb's quarter with

1344
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,939
varying success lamb's quarter is a

1345
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,859
great bio accumulator so what it will do

1346
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,440
is it'll actually take nutrients out of

1347
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:48,000
the deep soil and put them up into its

1348
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,039
leaves and store it and then you can cut

1349
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,318
it down and compost it or chop and drop

1350
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,940
it and those nutrients will return to

1351
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,818
the soil and be more available to your

1352
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,159
cash crops however they also are really

1353
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:01,858
tall and they're kind of a pain in the

1354
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,480
butt so I don't know that I I have mixed

1355
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,799
feelings about lamb's quarter I

1356
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,900
generally forget how much of a pain in

1357
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,818
the butt it is and then will allow it to

1358
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,260
come back one year and then the next few

1359
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,838
years be like oh yeah that was kind of

1360
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,520
difficult to deal with so

1361
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:16,558
um yeah I think personally it's kind of

1362
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:19,318
our big one right now if you're in a

1363
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,780
cold area dichondra ripens is a

1364
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,599
wonderful cover crop or companion plant

1365
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,160
I mean that doesn't die back in the

1366
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,260
winter so it's another one that kind of

1367
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:31,098
bridges that that gap of companion plant

1368
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,099
cover crop

1369
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,960
s yeah there's tons I mean you can use

1370
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,940
times as companions if you're growing in

1371
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,740
herbal medicinal plant that you want to

1372
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,720
be more prolific in the way that it

1373
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:46,139
smells you can do things like basil

1374
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,480
thyme oregano Rosemary and these things

1375
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:51,838
all have the potential to make your

1376
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,940
herbal plants more herbaceous and higher

1377
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,578
have higher smelling points on higher

1378
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,920
aromatics I don't know that there's been

1379
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:01,079
a lot of firm research that shows that

1380
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,700
definitively but anecdotally people

1381
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,079
definitely say that that is something

1382
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:07,500
that happens

1383
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,359
so yeah personally like food crops or

1384
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,338
crops that have a secondary use are my

1385
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,259
favorite companion plants so our

1386
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:15,058
purslane we utilize to make fermented

1387
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,700
plant juice which is one of our Korean

1388
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,280
natural farming fertilizer inputs

1389
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:22,439
um so for us it's easy it takes care of

1390
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,660
itself it doesn't require anything it

1391
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,539
comes back every year and I can use it

1392
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:29,578
for fertilizer as well as it protecting

1393
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:31,619
the soil and adding to that diversity

1394
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,300
that we talked about so if you can find

1395
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,519
things that are like triple threats like

1396
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:38,519
that right singing dancing and acting

1397
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:41,639
you've got fertilizer microbiological

1398
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:44,338
diversity and keeping your soil covered

1399
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:45,779
and safe like that's a great companion

1400
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,119
plant definitely a lot of good

1401
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,359
information there I myself have been

1402
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,940
grown indoors for 12 years and I've only

1403
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,400
grown Outdoors since 2018 so it's what

1404
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,099
four or four or five years and I haven't

1405
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,780
yet used companion plants so um

1406
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,500
definitely some of the information is

1407
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:06,300
takeaways for me on that one one note be

1408
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,400
careful of what you do use as a

1409
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,380
companion plant and pay attention to

1410
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,500
what kind of pests are prevalent on that

1411
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,260
companion plant I made the mistake of

1412
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,000
utilizing white Dutch Clover you hear

1413
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,859
all when you start going down this like

1414
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,559
companion plant cover crop type of

1415
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:24,598
rabbit hole one of the first things you

1416
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,579
hear about is white Dutch Clover that's

1417
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:30,180
what I use right now

1418
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:33,119
so my white Dutch Clover became a

1419
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:36,659
phenomenal Banker for thrips

1420
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,358
I had thrips that went up and down

1421
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:41,039
between my white Dutch Clover and my

1422
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,679
plants that were there my cash crop

1423
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:47,099
plants up and down and up and down and I

1424
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:49,799
I could not get rid of them at all it

1425
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:53,818
was impossible and because there was

1426
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,400
that white Dutch Clover that was such a

1427
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:58,019
um preferred food source and then they

1428
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,400
would go up and nibble on my cash crop

1429
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:01,858
and then they'd go back down and hide in

1430
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,660
the cover or in the companion plant

1431
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:04,980
um I couldn't I couldn't mitigate them

1432
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:07,799
at all I couldn't even manage them

1433
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,019
because I couldn't spray my cover crop

1434
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,539
or my companion plant my Clover that was

1435
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:15,059
down below so I ended up having to

1436
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:16,619
continually chop that Clover down Clover

1437
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,480
is great for a lot of things it is it

1438
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,220
makes wonderful biomass but if it

1439
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,800
becomes a banker for something like

1440
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:25,799
thrips it becomes an extreme problem

1441
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,920
because you can't get rid of it like it

1442
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,500
also will send out Runners that become

1443
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,079
new plants it's self-seed so it comes

1444
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,880
back every year I've now got it to where

1445
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,160
it stays in my walkways and gets

1446
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,740
trampled on and then if there's a pest

1447
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,318
problem it's not spreading to my other

1448
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:45,118
plants nearly as much it is the

1449
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:48,239
preferred food source so they tend to

1450
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,818
stay in it so they don't go to my other

1451
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,058
plants but especially if you're in an

1452
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:56,159
indoor situation your your Clover can

1453
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:58,260
become a problem with thrips

1454
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,899
specifically

1455
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,839
um there's nasturtiums and violas or

1456
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,420
violets or pansies that all become

1457
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,880
problems for spider mites so your spider

1458
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,039
mites will go in and out of those

1459
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,019
companion plants and in and out of your

1460
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,800
foliage back and forth and they're just

1461
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:18,780
having a sweet old time and you know it

1462
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,059
wouldn't it's not as much of a problem

1463
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,920
if you have those other plants there

1464
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,680
because they'll be the primary food

1465
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,858
source but you will have some plant

1466
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,019
resist or plant weakening in your cash

1467
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:33,000
crops because they're constantly being

1468
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,400
kind of nibbled on russet mites

1469
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,219
specifically are very very host specific

1470
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,160
so there are tomato russet mites they

1471
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:42,838
eat tomatoes there is

1472
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,818
um you know hempress it might it eats

1473
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:47,940
hemp there is

1474
00:55:44,818 --> 00:55:51,000
um a uh well that's a galmite I guess um

1475
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:54,599
but but most mites most of most russet

1476
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,719
mites are plant specific they don't tend

1477
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,579
to go back and forth and in fact as far

1478
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:01,259
as I know and I could be wrong there

1479
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,380
because I know they have been studying a

1480
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:06,300
lot these recipe in um institutions and

1481
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,480
things now

1482
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,880
um but as far as I last knew they were

1483
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,159
trying to get russet mites to move

1484
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:18,358
between hemp and

1485
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:21,179
um and uh hops and they were not having

1486
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,679
good success with that so they couldn't

1487
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:24,659
they couldn't get them to go back and

1488
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,818
forth the way that they wanted to Hops

1489
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:30,480
being one of the closest

1490
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:33,838
um plants to have so that they were you

1491
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,420
know unable to do that in a educational

1492
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,980
setting so out in nature might be a

1493
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,780
little bit different but as far as it

1494
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,719
goes with the studies that are being

1495
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,940
done they've not had good success so um

1496
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,759
just kind of have a mindset of like okay

1497
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:51,420
if I wanted to use Columbine what likes

1498
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,400
to eat Columbine Leaf Miners and thrips

1499
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,079
so maybe Columbine is not going to be

1500
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,818
even though it's a beautiful flower and

1501
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,160
I love it I might not want to put that

1502
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:01,558
in as a companion with my cash crops I

1503
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:04,799
might want to look at things that are

1504
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,440
um less that have less pests in similar

1505
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,000
in in similarity in similarities that a

1506
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,380
word yeah sure

1507
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,380
less pests similar

1508
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,260
definitely some good tips there I am

1509
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,720
probably going to stop using white touch

1510
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,040
Clover now that you mentioned that I

1511
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,078
have a little bit of a bag left so I

1512
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:23,818
won't waste it I'll still use it but uh

1513
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,619
but yeah that's that's crazy that drips

1514
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:28,139
feed off it alright so we are getting up

1515

1519
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:38,879
low till versus no-till cover crops

1520
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,559
companion plants mulch layers some of

1521
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,420
