1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,759
how about your daily routine how has

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,759
that changed having from basically no

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:11,719
equipment to having topof the-line

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:14,480
equipment um it's a lot more Stressless

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:18,600
I don't know if that's a word or term

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,560
but yeah um I I hand water so that's a a

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,118
thing that I still haven't figured out

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,919
um but other than that I I feel like I

9
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,960
can leave town for a couple days I can

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,640
leave town for like 2 3 days if

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,679
especially like you know grown in soil

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,719
you have a

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,119
2day in between watering most of the

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,480
time especially with like the medium I'm

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,679
using I don't have to water every single

16
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:47,359
day now that I'm in flour I might have

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:51,119
to water every other day but um yeah I

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:55,479
feel like growing in soil and with the

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,238
controller to hook it up to Wi-Fi so if

20
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,198
you go to Disneyland and you want to go

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,439
to Florida to visit your family or

22
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,599
things like that I still look at my

23
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,438
stuff I still see what's going on if you

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,359
have anybody in town you can have them

25
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,959
go do what you see going on oh this is

26
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,959
going on um hopefully I just to do this

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,719
it'll work that's huge um before I was

28
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,839
kind of just like scrambling I felt like

29
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,959
I was the only one that could fix any

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
problems I couldn't go out of town I

31
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,640
couldn't like there's no way like nobody

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,840
knows my problems nobody knows what can

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,799
be fixed but now it's kind of like a I

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,040
don't want to say automated cuz there's

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,439
like the new like automated system but

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,040
it helps me control myem I've like I've

37
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:41,758
been saying this ter a lot with my

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,079
friend I talk about growing and it's

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,920
like full control no offense to like

40
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,039
companies growing Autos or anybody that

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,719
grows Autos but I don't personally right

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,719
now because I really like full control

43
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,599
when

44
00:01:53,718 --> 00:02:01,199
it um I want to know how many days of

45
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,038
veg I can go for I if plant just decides

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,759
to do what it wants to do I want to know

47
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:10,360
how many like if uh right now I have one

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,159
gallons in my T I want to know that I

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,800
have this many one gallons the bare

50
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:20,439
minimum I'm always going to put the bare

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,120
minimum at developing uh 28 you know at

52
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:26,598
the

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,360
lowest 28 um at the weight of each one

54
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,799
gallon I'm just going to you know I'm

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,640
not going to high help if I know how

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,560
many I have and I know how many that

57
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,878
can develop then with the auto you could

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,360
never really calculate or predict those

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,359
thing with um photo periods and having a

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,720
system that is controlled that word

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,879
control become so much more like you can

62
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,759
control every single thing that's going

63
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,878
on even when it comes to like cutting

64
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,199
clones you kind of can control how many

65
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,158
days going to take the Roots come out

66
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,878
well a little bit of it is hope but if

67
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:04,239
you know what you're doing you can fully

68
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,878
control it wow having that controller

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,599
like you mentioned where you can

70
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:11,518
basically go into an app on your phone

71
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,158
and be able to not only see what your

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,039
conditions are but you can control the

73
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,519
different pieces of equipment through it

74
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,079
there as well that's a game changer yeah

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,719
that's crazy I felt the same way when I

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
went to like the AC Infinity system

77
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,799
using their App instead of kind of being

78
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,000
blind I spent so many years without that

79
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,438
and it is kind of nervous leaving town

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,878
because you don't even know like you

81
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:36,120
just hope that your plants are going to

82
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,479
be good to go you hope that the the

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,480
environment conditions are going to be

84
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,318
solid that the lighting is going to turn

85
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,479
on like it should and turn off like it

86
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,399
should you know so yeah that's

87
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,518
definitely uh definitely a huge game

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,280
changer that's another thing I forgot um

89
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,640
before you guys came I was having a

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:58,560
problem with um my lighting like I um

91
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:02,639
was using like the old like spin wheel

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,280
timers and and you know it happens I did

93
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:10,399
it wrong I was probably high but um I uh

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,079
W winded back my timer to where somehow

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,879
it was a couple more hours of light than

96
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,319
it should be it didn't turn off or it

97
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:19,478
cut back on and um literally things were

98
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,399
starting to Revenge everything had those

99
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,199
rev uh branded everything like every nut

100
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,918
it was wild but I wasn't able to catch

101
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
that because during those times it was

102
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,599
out I wasn't going to open that door I

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,280
was like just no way I don't need to go

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,400
in there like P up but um now that I

105
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,638
have the controller I don't really have

106
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,959
to worry about that I will say if you

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
are new to the controller at all and

108
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,519
you're setting up the controller by hand

109
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,280
I don't think anybody should do that you

110
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,680
need to use the app because there's like

111
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,239
the left and right button sometimes will

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,879
change settings that you don't even

113
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,519
notice and your lights might cut back on

114
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,759
and the only way to change that is in

115
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,359
the app I've had to happened to two

116
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,240
different people I've seen on Instagram

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,280
and I personally messaged them and

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
they're like y thank you like this is

119
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,399

120
