1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
coming up on garden talk if you've never

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:08,160
heard the name before and it's got a lot

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,039
of syllables and the price is incredibly

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
cheap

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,959
avoid that manufacturer nowadays there

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,519
are some pretty crappy lights that still

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,839
get surprisingly good results just

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,359
because they managed to get the spectrum

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,719
and the diodes right you cannot simply

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,439
get your light intensity up to 50 000

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,238
lux or whatever with the wrong spectrum

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,799
and expect to get great results

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,679
the number one problem with lighting is

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,839
often that the first time you set it up

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,558
you allow a light leak to happen during

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
the dark hours more often than not it's

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,199
not that a person gets a bad light it's

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
that they get a good light and they hang

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,160
it incorrectly

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
what's up everybody if you that don't

about lighting for plants so we're going

to get deep into led grow lights but

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,199
we're also going to touch upon your

81
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,199
traditional hid lighting such as hps mh

82
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,799

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
introduction can you tell me a little

85
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,878
bit about yourself and how you got into

86
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,598
gardening

87
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,840
my name is lex blazer i'm a how-to

88
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,959
youtuber and i've been uh

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
gardening the herbs for about 15 years

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,158
or so

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,759
um i've never been like a huge

92
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:34,560
commercial or underground grower you

93
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,560
know contrary to popular opinion uh the

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,319
most i can say is i've been a very

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,319
stable and steady grower for about uh 15

96
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:47,199
years and i'm also one of the older uh

97
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,039
medical planned youtubers in this niche

98
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,518
and i originally kind of became known

99
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,158
for throwing together these very quick

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,200
uh efficient how-to's for beginner

101
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,079
growers uh covering all their questions

102
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:03,839
and i did that for a bunch of years and

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
i also did sort of more general um

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
grower culture videos and then over the

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,319
last let's say

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,039
half a dozen years or so with lighting

107
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,598
getting a lot more exciting and diverse

108
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,719
i've been doing a lot more grow journals

109
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,199
and lighting reviews and playing with uh

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560

that's so funny cool so what's your

138
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,519
style of gardening are you indoors

139
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,839
outdoors um you know are you in soil

140
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:33,038
cocoa organic synthetic singhanic

141
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,839
so being a canadian and having spent

142
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,038
most of my time in chile northern

143
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,119
alberta

144
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,478
i'm definitely an indoor grower

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,399
primarily

146
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,199
and while i've dabbled in a few

147
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,519
different forms of hydroponics i've

148
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,160
tried deep water culture

149
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,519
i've tried aeroponics i've tried a

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,840
little bit of cocoa i do grow mostly in

151
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,399
soil um the reason being is that i find

152
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,038
most types of hydro and cocoa to be a

153
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,839
little bit too finicky for my taste and

154
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,959
i'm a very low maintenance style type of

155
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,679
a grower

156
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,478
so i always try to see how far i can get

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,759
on the least number of man hours

158
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,159
when i'm growing so soil suits me very

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,400
well from that standpoint

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
i don't maintain

161
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,439
organics so i cannot call myself an

162
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,439
organic grower so i'll have to call

163
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,478
myself a synthetic one

164
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,959
though i am a low nutrients

165
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,918
type of grower especially the past few

166
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,839
years just because i feel that

167
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,399
nowadays genetics have made such

168
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,119
incredible progress that you don't

169
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,839
really have to slather on various nudes

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
for

171
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,000
eye-popping results at least if you're

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,758
ultra careful about maintaining all the

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
other aspects

174
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,439
of your grow room so yeah that's i guess

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
the kind of grower i am overall

176
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,759
yeah the over fertilization is very very

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,959
common i mean still to this day even

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,720
back in uh you know uh 10 12 years ago

179
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,598
when i first started that was a common

180
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,080
problem and so you mentioning that you

181
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,839
feed real low amounts it makes sense you

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,598
know i mean there are many like

183
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,758
variables when it comes to feeding of

184
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,279
course what bdm you're using

185
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,840
which nutrient line you're using and so

186
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,000
on and so forth but uh you can get away

187
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,159
with a lot lower doses and what's

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,639
recommended on most feeding charts so

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,360
yeah less less is definitely more

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,000
nowadays if you can get away with it and

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,400
more often than not you'll find you can

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,079
absolutely all right let's get into

193
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,399
lighting for plants that's what this

194
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,560
episode is going to revolve around um so

195
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,959
what are you currently using for

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,598
lighting over your plants and why that

197
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,918
lighting yeah so i mean i i've never had

198
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
the luxury for many years now of kind of

199
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,680
growing with what i want to grow i kind

200
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,160
of grow whatever shows up uh in in the

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,598
mail for me but i found that the last

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
bunch of years

203
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,959
very consistently what has been showing

204
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,079
up in the mail that i've been wanting to

205
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,359
show up in the mail has been number one

206
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,959
leds

207
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,000
number two leds that are fanless

208
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:17,120
that's been the second kind of

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,918
thing that's gone on and also i found

210
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,160
that nowadays i grow with leds that are

211
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,279
fan less that also give what's typically

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,599
known as the white light spectrum

213
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,878
which is a sort of natural listing

214
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,679
looking light not that reddish purplish

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,240
hue that most people associate uh with

216
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,838
the older leds and those are typically

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
leds that contain

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,399
3000k

219
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,120
5000k a little bit of red uh the nicer

220
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,559
ones also mix in a little bit of uh

221
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,720
uh ultraviolet and infrared and yeah

222
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,599
that's been the general lighting style

223
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,639
it's been all leds

224
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
for five years now so what model grow

225
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:05,278
lights are you currently using uh

226
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,399
currently i am running a mars hydro as

227
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,439
well as a kind led

228
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,759
and

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
in the recent past i've tried out some

230
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,919
of g8

231
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
newer models because it's been a while

232
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,039
since they came out with some models

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,759
those are those are the main ones lately

234
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,399
but yet it rotates quite a bit

235
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,278
gotcha yeah i've been using the uh

236
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,080
electric sky es 300 by the green

237
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,600
sunshine company that one has been great

238
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,240
i've used some

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,000
spider farmer at the sf2000 for a while

240
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
i'm the same way as you as far as like

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
companies are always offering to send me

242
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,679
stuff to grow with and send on the

243
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,879
channel now oftentimes they say no

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,120
more times

245
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,879
i typically say no but there are many

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,080
companies that just reach out to you

247
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,879
especially when you have such a large

248
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,200
audience on youtube companies want their

249
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,600
grow lights to be seen in front of that

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
large audience so i'm the same way with

251
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,959
you a lot of these companies have sort

252
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,800
of figured out that um

253
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,719
there's a lot of names that come and go

254
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,519
and they don't necessarily mean an awful

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,800
lot to a lot of casual people so the way

256
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,000
to get your lights known is to have

257
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,599
influencers youtubers and so forth uh

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,278
getting them into their hands and

259
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,639
there's certainly some brands in

260
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,600
particular a spider farmer who've gone

261
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,278
from

262
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
total unknown

263
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,838
four or five years ago to being a fairly

264
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,360
recognizable name today just off of that

265
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,360
strategy yep i think another one worth

266
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
mentioning is viper spectra i'm growing

267
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,278
with one of their their ks5000 right now

268
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
which is great their new series the ks

269
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,439
series is just

270
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,159
really awesome up there as far as

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,519
quality but low budget pricing you know

272
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,559
so they're up there with the best of the

273
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,959
best in my opinion so yeah i i just i

274
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,119
just had viper spectre on i think i was

275
00:10:52,958 --> 00:11:00,399
growing with a ts 1000 and or no no it

276
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,200
was a p4000 it was their their big one

277
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,919
and yeah really good light wouldn't know

278
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,240
that it's one of uh the lower budget

279
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,679
lights that you can get in that size but

280
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
some of these companies like viper

281
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,519
spectre for example have had a bad

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
reputation in the past right some of

283
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
these grow lights

284
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,799
just were less efficient than some of

285
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
your traditional hps mh cmh grow lights

286
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,559
in the past right

287
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,600
can you talk to us about led grow lights

288
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,439
how they were back in like 2014 2015 and

289
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
how they've evolved since then i know

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,320
you have a great video on your channel

291
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,319
about that actually yeah so uh first off

292
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
what people have to understand is led

293
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,360
lighting is a really new technology

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
especially as far as led lights that

295
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,680
work well

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,880
it used to be the case that lighting was

297
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,799
a lot more expensive per watt

298
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,600
in terms of the cost of the lighting

299
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,679
fixtures they were far less reliable

300
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
because they had more components back in

301
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,359
the day

302
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,399
every single diode had more circuitry

303
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,440
there used to be fans which there aren't

304
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,919
the build quality used to be lower

305
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
the manufacturers simply didn't have any

306
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,199
experience because all of them were new

307
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:16,240
to it and also most importantly the

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,480
spectrum has changed a great deal

309
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
there used to be a really basic spectrum

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,600
and there wasn't really enough

311
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,078
in it

312
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and it was too far removed from natural

313
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:32,479
sunlight back in 2014 2015 a good led

314
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
light had maybe three

315
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,519
different uh colors

316
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,320
in the spectrum three different diodes

317
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,720
and they were mostly like a blue and a

318
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
red and then a deeper red and that's all

319
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,759
they kind of had it didn't work very

320
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,239
well

321
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
over time what happened was

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
spectrums got added

323
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,600
spectrums got refined

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,039
uh build quality increased

325
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,278
uh actual true power efficiency in terms

326
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,078
of what these lights draw from the wall

327
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,679
actually went up so nowadays they're

328
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,919
truly half of hid or even less whereas

329
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,199
before saying that was kind of like a

330
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,159
stretch if you you know you know counted

331
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,480
the ballast from the hid and so forth

332
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,958
nowadays it's a lot more than that uh

333
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,320
and of course uh the prices for the

334
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:27,679
fixtures themselves dropped dramatically

335
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,040
uh dimming was introduced daisy chaining

336
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,319
was introduced uh the leds became

337
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,319
silent slimmer brighter like it all just

338
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,360
got better and better every year since

339
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,680
the 2014 2015 zone

340
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,560
that you mentioned and it was right

341
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,519
around the beginning of 2017

342
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,399
that i both mentally myself made the

343
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,120
switch to leds and got to the point

344
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,839
where i was recommending them to others

345
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,078
in most circumstances yeah and that

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,839
nowadays it's uh overwhelmingly i

347
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,439
recommend leds

348
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
gotcha i actually made the switch back

349
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
in 2015. the first one i had was a

350
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,759
platinum led

351
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,120
p9 xml2 i'm surprised i actually

352
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,159
remember the model number i remember

353
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,679
that

354
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,198
i remember but uh that one actually

355
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,879
worked really good they had the cree

356
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,879
diodes in there i got a really good

357
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,720
yield off of it one of the things i

358
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,639
remember that has changed over the years

359
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
which you mentioned was fans right they

360
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
went from active cooling which a lot of

361
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,919
people don't know active versus passive

362
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,958
active cooling is when there's actually

363
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,639
a fan actively cooling the fixture so

364
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,638
there would be fans throughout the

365
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,399
fixture and that's actually a fail point

366
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
right if a fan goes out

367
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
well then you're you could actually

368
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
potentially have an overheating issue

369
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
with that uh used to be a big fail

370
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,000
exactly now there's more passive cooling

371
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
whether there's no there's heat sinks

372
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,759
basically there's no fans there's heat

373
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
sinks which which will allow the heat to

374
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,519
kind of dissipate off of the fixture

375
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,680
yeah the manufacturers have really been

376
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,480
playing a game the last few years where

377
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,719
they try and get the diode intensity as

378
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,278
high as they possibly can

379
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,720
without getting rid of the passive uh or

380
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,039
without getting rid of the passive

381
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,600
cooling uh in the process and they've

382
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,838
been very successful particularly the

383
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,759
last four years or so yeah it seems like

384
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
there's a split between companies that

385
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,639
are

386
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,039
loading up the diodes

387
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,759
and having a low amount of watts to it

388
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,240
so to increase the lifespan versus

389
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,679
running a lower amount of diodes

390
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
higher wattage

391
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,679
and really pushing it so i think there's

392
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,480
kind of that balance there let's not

393
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:34,958
forget about hid grow lights you know so

394
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,519
hps mh cmh all those fall into high

395
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,599
intensity discharge or hid grow lights

396
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,440
they're still used by many grows today

397
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,399
what are your thoughts on those type of

398
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,639
grow lights yeah so first off i should

399
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,600
point out that a good quality uh hid

400
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,079
bulb is still a terrific light spectrum

401
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
it's actually in in many ways second

402
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,198
only to sunlight which is the best light

403
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,600
spectrum the one issue with hid is of

404
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,198
course the electrical inefficiency

405
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
that's becoming a bigger and bigger

406
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,639
issue and also they produce quite a bit

407
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,120
of heat

408
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,480
and that can be an issue for some people

409
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,839
uh there's also certain situations where

410
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,159
you still need to use hid for example

411
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,800
growers who live in areas where the

412
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,519
electricity isn't 100

413
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,439
reliable or steady and there's still

414
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
things like offloading i was just

415
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,000
talking to a fellow who lives in rural

416
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,039
south africa for example and he wanted

417
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,759
to use leds but he couldn't because that

418
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,319
type of unsteady electrical flow

419
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,240
will annihilate most led fixtures they

420
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,440
just can't take those kind of

421
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,759
fluctuations whereas hid is a ton more

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,839
resistant to it and so this guy was

423
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,519
still using

424
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:56,880
hid so there's still a use for hid

425
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,919
i think that their spectrum is excellent

426
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,799
um

427
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,519
the electrical use those is a problem

428
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,359
and

429
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,078
as far as as high quality hid goes

430
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:12,078
i i do think that gavita still leads the

431
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:14,720
industry uh as far as hids uh it's not

432
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,359
that their bulbs contain

433
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,199
uh a spectrum that's so superior to

434
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:24,958
every other hid since every grow bulb

435
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,558
oriented hid gives off a decent spectrum

436
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,038
but uh

437
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,639
they certainly have the best longevity

438
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,720
on their components and that's why the

439
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
commercial growers use them so much

440
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,960
there's still many commercial growers in

441
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,240
particular the old school guys who've

442
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,120
been around in a long time uh because

443
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,679
they're in a setting where the lighting

444
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,879
is and the cost of the lighting is less

445
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,840
of a issue for the overall grow they'll

446
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,000
still stick to hids and that's all good

447
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,918
yeah i think as the years go on and leds

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,400
are more and more popular people are

449
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,679
kind of forgetting about hid you know

450
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
hps cmh they still have a place in here

451
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
for sure i used hid grill lights

452
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,159
particularly i used the

453
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,519
mh

454
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,360
and hps for the first six years of

455
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,558
growing then they made that transition

456
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,719
to led i actually did try cmh for a

457
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,160
short period of time as well the one

458
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,600
thing i don't like about hid grow lights

459
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
is the

460
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,038
light spread

461
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
unfortunately you've got that just a hot

462
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,640
spot down in the center

463
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
and then the outer edges really that the

464
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
part drops off now i know that it is

465
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,720
going to be the reflector is going to

466
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,880
have a big impact on it

467
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,480
but uh that's one thing i feel like that

468
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
a lot of these new led grow light

469
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400
fixtures

470
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,200
have a big leg up on them is being able

471
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
to evenly spread that light across the

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,640
entire footprint and also the efficiency

473
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,440
i mean you touched upon that a little

474
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,080
bit

475
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,519
back in the day i would run a 600 watt

476
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,439
hid grow light in a 4x4 grow space

477
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,319
now i'm able to run i actually have like

478
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,200
230 watts going right now in a 4x4 under

479
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,798
400 watts for a 4x4 and it's covering

480
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,120
that entire space

481
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,879
very efficiently so

482
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,000
they still produce really good results

483
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,000
hps mh cmh but it seems like more and

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,279
more people are transitioning over to

485
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,880
led yeah and i mean there's a bunch to

486
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:24,639
be said for using um your hps and your

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,360
metal halides and such like properly

488
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,520
um there's kind of a few tips i often

489
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,558
give people like first off

490
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,200
if you do go with hid do use a digital

491
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,119
ballast not a magnetic ballast

492
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
digital ballasts are more efficient

493
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,798
quieter they produce less heat

494
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,960
uh beyond that uh the metal halide bulbs

495
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,519
are really only for vegetative phase

496
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,759
guys uh they don't work well during

497
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,720
flowering back in the day the low budget

498
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,359
folks

499
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,279
who could only afford one bulb and

500
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,558
they'd buy an hid bulb what they'd

501
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,639
actually do is they'd buy just the hps

502
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,759
and they'd use it for vegetative and

503
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,240
flowering and that was okay but not

504
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,960
ideal because the metal halide bulbs

505
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,880
have a slightly more of a blue tinge to

506
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,759
their spectrum which worked better for

507
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
veg

508
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,519
uh but yeah you just can't use the metal

509
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,759
halide during flowering and as you said

510
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,639
like with hid bulbs your choice of

511
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,119
reflector makes an enormous difference

512
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,600
to the performance as well as to the

513
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,959
longevity of the bulb so like for

514
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,918
example your hood reflectors that have

515
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
glass covers to them those reflectors

516
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,919
are more expensive and they're heavier

517
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
and a pain in the butt to hang but

518
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
they're just amazing for hooking up

519
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,798
ducts to them and then getting all that

520
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,640
excess heat out from all the lights out

521
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,720
of the room which is really kind of

522
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,720
important when you're running you know

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,759
12 16 20 lights in a big room you really

524
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,480
gotta

525
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,400
dissipate that heat out so yeah that's

526
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,798
one of the main struggles that i had

527
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,120
living in a desert region is the heat

528
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,639
that it produces right and i had to have

529
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,119
the one with i mean i had the wing

530
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
reflector before uh but having the

531
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,719
actual

532
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,520
uh cooling hood where you can hooked up

533
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
the ducting was so key for somebody like

534
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,720
me

535
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,720
it used to be a life changer and and

536
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,279
there were all sorts of gorilla grows

537
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,000
that were working with limited space

538
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:27,519
um limited ceilings

539
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,759
uh limited ventilation sometimes so yeah

540
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,480
you had to uh take what you could get

541
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,200
for heat removal yeah even though there

542
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,360
are some downsides to hid lighting uh

543
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,880
the flowers that are produced and that's

544
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,599
still some people's argument today is

545
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,720
the flowers are just it can be so good

546
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,918
but let's get back to led grow lights

547
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,159
so in your opinion what makes a good led

548
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,559
grow light uh well one thing i'll say is

549
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
that nowadays there are some pretty

550
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,119
crappy lights that still get

551
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,119
surprisingly good results

552
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,599
just because they managed to get the

553
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,719
spectrum and the diodes right

554
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,839
so i'm i don't want to discriminate too

555
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,159
much against any particular light but

556
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,879
generally what makes a good light is

557
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,200
that a good manufacturer number one has

558
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,159
a year's long track record of making

559
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,279
them and they have high quality diodes

560
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,679
either

561
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,798
samsung or osram

562
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,600
and they'll tell you you know which ones

563
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,639
beyond that you want a good grow light

564
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,279
that has a minimum number of components

565
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,840
uh because as we discussed earlier

566
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,798
there's fail safes on those kind of

567
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,599
spots

568
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,079
nowadays comp or the manufacturers have

569
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,879
gotten good about that and you want to

570
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,119
light the dissipates heat very well

571
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,080
and you also want it to come with as

572
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,959
many features as possible now for led

573
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:56,079
lights features means number one it's

574
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,279
properly waterproofed uh which some of

575
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,319
the

576
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,519
less expensive lights might not be

577
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,678
but they

578
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,279
they come with waterproof designations

579
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,400
that you can look up to make sure that

580
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,798
they're there

581
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,600
and they do have to come with some basic

582
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,158
functionality the big one is dimming

583
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,158
and it used to be that there was no

584
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,120
dimming then there was dimming done with

585
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,240
a screwdriver uh if you do it right and

586
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,119
nowadays you kind of should expect a

587
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,079
proper dimming knob on an led light and

588
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,079
you also want them to uh have a daisy

589
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,839
chain capability so you can tie a whole

590
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,918
bunch of them together

591
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,359
and yeah that's pretty much what it

592
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,240
entails um i should note though like i

593
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,798
said

594
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
you can get some amazing results

595
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,440
out of lights that

596
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,880
aren't impressive in many other ways and

597
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:53,120
spending a thousand bucks in the light

598
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,039
and hanging it wrong is pointless and

599
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,359
more often than not it's not that a

600
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,599
person gets a bad light because there's

601
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,839
so many good lights on the market it's

602
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,319
that they get a good light and they hang

603
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,199
it incorrectly so for example when

604
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,200
dealing with led lights versus hid you

605
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,519
have to always bear in mind how much

606
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,240
closer an led light has to be to the

607
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,759
canopy in order to get the same kind of

608
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,159
light intensity

609
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,240
that an hid will give you from a couple

610
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,080
feet further away i think one thing that

611
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,480
i would add that you hadn't mentioned is

612
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,158
the light spread across the footprint

613
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,720
there's still some led lights out there

614
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,559
that have the light focused towards the

615
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,400
dead center of the footprint and then it

616
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,639
really drops off as you get to those

617
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
outer edges you know i'm talking like a

618
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,759
thousand ppfd dead center but it drops

619
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,359
down to like 200 on the outer edges

620
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,000
a lot of these companies are making the

621
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,479
bar style grow lights these days which

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,079
really helps spread that light evenly

623
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,599
across the footprint so that's one of

624
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,278
the things i personally look for that i

625
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,079
personally think makes a good grow light

626
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,640
these days yeah i i totally agree with

627
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,879
that sentiment uh definitely the

628
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
weakness that led lights have had in the

629
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
past was this kind of light spread

630
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,839
concentration problem and it was

631
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:09,038
especially bad a number of years ago

632
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:12,158
and then this uh once fanless leds took

633
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,879
off and you could have a bar type light

634
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,360
the bar lights just exploded and now

635
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,240
every manufacturer has a bar light going

636
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,599
on and they are really good they really

637
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,720
do get the light spread even um even if

638
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,678
you use an inexpensive thing like uh the

639
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,200
fc series by mars hydro one of their

640
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,240
lights those don't cost enough a lot but

641
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
because

642
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,400
of the way they're designed and they're

643
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,558
so wide you get excellent coverage right

644
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
at the corners so one other thing to

645
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,079
probably get a little bit deeper on is

646
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,240
light spectrum

647
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,158
a lot of people put a lot of focus on

648
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
light spectrum and then you've got the

649
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,559
people on the opposing side saying that

650
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,519
spectrum isn't as important it's more

651
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,639
about the photon density coming down on

652
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,200
to the canopy what's your thoughts on

653
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
light spectrum how important really is

654
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,600
light spectrum we talked about the

655
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,079
evolution of going from blurple to more

656
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,759
white light does that really matter

657
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,480
can people still grow with propel these

658
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,480
days what are your thoughts um well my

659
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,159
opinion is that light spectrum does

660
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,480
matter a lot and people can grow with

661
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,640
blurple but they shouldn't i do believe

662
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,240
that light spectrum makes an enormous

663
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
difference

664
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,960
you cannot simply

665
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,200
you know get your light intensity up to

666
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,919
50 000

667
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,038
lux or whatever with the wrong spectrum

668
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,200
and expect to get great results however

669
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,679
there are certain parts of the spectrum

670
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,400
that you absolutely have to hit and if

671
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,360
you hit them you get most of the way

672
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
there

673
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,439
and so

674
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,720
that's how we arrived at these white

675
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,200
yellow red type of light combinations

676
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,200
and i i do think that those are

677
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,919
mandatory you got to hit those type of

678
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,159
light spectrums in order to get

679
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,038
plants growing the way you really want

680
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,320
them to grow and in a way that honestly

681
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:11,278
competes with your high quality hids

682
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,000
like gavita so that's my two cents on it

683
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,839
i'm certainly not in the camp of a

684
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,679
spectrum doesn't matter and it's all

685
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,720
about light intensity in fact if

686
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,360
anything i'm in the camp that says that

687
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
light intensity has been overdone

688
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,359
um

689
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,679
with too much sales going on of

690
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,398
manufacturers going oh i can get it this

691
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
high and i can get it that high and

692
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,199
they're not bothering to keep in mind

693
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,038
well the plant can't absorb anything

694
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,159
beyond a certain amount

695
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,759
so uh yeah that's my two cents on that i

696
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,200
agree with you on that last point where

697
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,359
you say it's like these lights are

698
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,319
getting stronger and stronger but the

699
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,599
plants aren't able to take it right and

700
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,038
there are some people out there that are

701
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,359
going to say well that just means you

702
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,720
need to increase your nutrients and dial

703
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,199
in your environment a little bit more

704
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,640
then your plant will be able to take it

705
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,798
but really i mean some of these grow

706
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,960
lights are going 2 000

707
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,158
up to 3 000

708
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,759
ppfd yeah and these medicinal plants

709
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,200
they just get fried off of it you know

710
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,599
you see it in the top part of the plant

711
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,519
and it works its way down and it's just

712
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,599
it gets completely fried and you see a

713
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,440
stunt growth and a lot of folks

714
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,278
think that they just need to increase

715
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
the feeding and it doesn't work for them

716
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,919
and then all of a sudden they have a you

717
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,000
know a lack of a harvest because of

718
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,600
they've so much damage to their plants

719
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,240
yeah it's it's there's

720
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,359
sort of that kind of over maximizing

721
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,679
mentality and it exists not just in the

722
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,639
lighting but it exists in in the

723
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,960
nutrients as well and it exists with co2

724
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,840
as well like people think oh i'm gonna

725
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,120
i'm gonna get my co2 parts per million

726
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,798
in the room up to like 1800 2000 and

727
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,879
that's going to do something

728
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,879
no it won't

729
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,039
but but you will spend a ton of money on

730
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,799
your co2 gas

731
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,558
so we touched upon quite a few things

732
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,079
there are so many things that you can

733
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,158
look at when

734
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,398
determining whether or not to buy a led

735
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,600
go light are there any particular grow

736
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,398
lights or grow like companies that you

737
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,639
suggest people to buy sure so let's

738
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,119
break this down a little bit by budget

739
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,360
because budget is usually the

740
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,879
the one differential for growers when it

741
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,079
comes to this thing

742
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,559
so on the lower budget scale try out a

743
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,199
mars hydro as i've said i've grown with

744
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,440
the light slots including their more

745
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,640
affordable ones and i've had zero

746
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,038
problems

747
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,600
for all the times i've run them

748
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,079
ditto for brands like viper spectra and

749
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,480
spider farmer so what all of those have

750
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,519
in common is those are all inexpensive

751
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,120
asian made lights but they're quite good

752
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,918
all those companies have a lot of

753
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,239
experience making them and they do use

754
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,600
good quality diodes which is kind of the

755
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,640
main thing

756
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,719
for your mid-budget lighting um check

757
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,320
out electric sky as you've said i've

758
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,600
used electric sky es 180 and i really

759
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,519
enjoyed it uh phyllis on

760
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,000
growers choice

761
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,079
there's also a company called california

762
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
light works but that's almost getting

763
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:18,480
closer to like medium high budget

764
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,919
and for the high budget stuff there is

765
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,880
of course

766
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,880
hlg the horticulture lighting group for

767
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,480
their quantum board

768
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,440
style leds so they make the highest end

769
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,200
little flat led lights

770
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,440
but also the newer stuff by g8 some

771
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,600
people don't like the older g8 model

772
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
because it didn't have very good power

773
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,918
but the new stuff is very good and

774
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,519
obviously the manufacturing quality is

775
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,679
top notch

776
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,240
i've been really impressed by the kind

777
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,960
led that i've been running so gross

778
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,319
strong industries which is kind led is

779
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,360
doing good work

780
00:30:54,319 --> 00:31:00,158
and of course gavita which don't only

781
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,959
make hid bulbs but now they've gotten

782
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,080
into

783
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,798
the high-end leds which uh for example

784
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:11,839
their uh gavita pro 1700e

785
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:14,000
is a bar style led light which is just a

786
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,158
more heavy-duty version

787
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,798
than what all of the other companies

788
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,120
they just listed make so yeah there you

789
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,319
go that's some companies okay so lots of

790
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,719
options there there are so many

791
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,278
companies out there it's hard to uh

792
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,839
hard to mention all of them i'm sure

793
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,839
but uh taking that and flipping to the

794
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,278
opposite side are there any particular

795
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,038
grow lights or girl like companies that

796
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:41,119
you suggest people to avoid yeah so like

797
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:44,240
my advice is uh this industry has an odd

798
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,278
um sort of thing it does where companies

799
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,319
show up

800
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,720
they make a name they sell a few lights

801
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,558
and then they either disappear or they

802
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
change their name over

803
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,038
and most of these companies are

804
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,080
out of china

805
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,640
and uh my advice is if you've never

806
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,519
heard the name before and it's got a lot

807
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,480
of syllables and the price is incredibly

808
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,599
cheap

809
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,079
avoid that manufacturer and

810
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,278
don't be buying lights on ebay or

811
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,439
anything like that when when you're in

812
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,679
doubt about the brand and there's many

813
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,960
of these kind of names that come and go

814
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,240
like uh sehan

815
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,360
roli dro galaxy hydro there's a bunch of

816
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,759
these names

817
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:33,199
some of them sound like the others just

818
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,839
look up reviews instead by which i mean

819
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,558
reviews of somebody who's actually grown

820
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:41,918
with the light not just did a spec

821
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,240
review on camera of just the hardware

822
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,880
with a par meter without growing under

823
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,319
it and what you'll find is that

824
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,960
you will get a lot out of that review as

825
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,918
far as understanding the quality of the

826
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,159
fixture and whether it might be subpar

827
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,399
the nice thing is a lot of the light

828
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,640
brands that i wouldn't recommend you

829
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,759
can't get them because they only existed

830
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,679
for 18 months you know three years ago

831
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,720
five years ago and now they're gone so

832
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,880
yeah just

833
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,839
if you haven't heard of a brand

834
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,559
repeatedly look into it deeply because

835
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,879
these brands rotate like crazy that's

836
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,398
definitely some good advice there

837
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,080
you touch upon

838
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,319
measuring the light output i want to get

839
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,960
deeper into that there are a couple

840
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,359
different ways to go about that lumens

841
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
par just a couple to mention

842
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,398
what

843
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,000
method do you suggest for measuring

844
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,558
light yeah

845
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,679
well the first thing i'll say is that

846
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,879
the majority of casual you know

847
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,360
beginner at-home growers they don't need

848
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,880
a light meter at all they can get by

849
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,839
without one

850
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,240
there are some general um

851
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,599
general guidelines for how far the hang

852
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
away lights

853
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,599
often the lights themselves come with

854
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,159
them with the manual that gives you some

855
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:03,359
rough idea and you can often just hang

856
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,159
the light up and you can um

857
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,398
check the temperature at the canopy and

858
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,039
have it roughly right and beyond that

859
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,878
just gauge the reactions of the plants

860
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:16,398
and adjust it up or down a little bit

861
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,279
based on that so you don't need a meter

862
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,838
but

863
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,359
when it comes to meters you've got two

864
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,519
types mainly

865
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,039
there's the meters that measure lumens

866
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,119
or lux

867
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,440
that is a simple measure of light

868
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,159
intensity that's it total light

869
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,280
intensity and then there's par meters

870
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,358
which measures something called ppfd

871
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,359
that is

872
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,759
photosynthetically active radiation

873
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,639
and par meters only measure the light

874
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,480
that your plants can actually utilize

875
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,679
and they give you a much higher level of

876
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,039
precision

877
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
now uh

878
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:55,119
when it most growers at a higher level

879
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
can still actually get away with using

880
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,920
a lumen meter for most functions because

881
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,679
only all the lumen meter will really

882
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,079
tell you is whether you have enough

883
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,159
intensity or whether you might have too

884
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,320
much so if you if you're setting up a

885
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,078
whole bunch of lights in a room and

886
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,240
you're wondering well am i putting them

887
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
close together am i putting them too

888
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,199
close to the canopy all you really need

889
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,599
is a lumen meter to determine that and

890
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,879
beyond that you know that the spectrum

891
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,599
and the par

892
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,760
and so forth is going to be okay because

893
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:30,240
they're grower oriented grow lights

894
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,040
now there's a couple weaknesses for

895
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:36,719
example a lumen meter doesn't work as

896
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,960
well with led lights that have uh fewer

897
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,559
spectrums on them it's not quite as

898
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,920
precise on those

899
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:47,358
and a lumen meter is not precise enough

900
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,159
to measure one light that's an led light

901
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,358
for example against another light that's

902
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,719
an led light and know exactly which one

903
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,400
of them gives

904
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,358
more of the light that plants can

905
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,559
actually use and utilize

906
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,880
so

907
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,159
essentially most people don't need a

908
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,358
meter

909
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,519
a lumens meter gives them

910
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,759
you know enough data and information

911
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,960
that most people can be happy with it

912
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,119
and a par meter is the most specific but

913
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
most growers probably don't need them

914
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,800
and they're quite expensive

915
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,199
i agree with that i actually personally

916
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,800
ended up investing in a par meter i got

917
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,559
the apple gmq 500 and then eventually

918
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,599
once the extended range meter came out

919
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,480
it's the apogee

920
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,680
mq-620 which actually i think they

921
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,119
discontinued now it's the mq-610

922
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,679
but it gives you that extended rate

923
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,640
specifically for led grow lights

924
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,399
and

925
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,039
i was one of those guys back in the day

926
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,720
which would unbox the light and hold the

927
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,079
par meter underneath it and show what

928
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,279
the power measurements were but didn't

929
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,119
use the light

930
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,359
now i did that specifically for in my

931
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,000
defense did that specifically for just

932
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,719
to help out the viewers that were buying

933
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,960
those grow lights or potentially buying

934
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,639
those grow lights because back then and

935
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,320
even still to this day there are

936
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,879
companies that rely

937
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,039
on their listing specifically that par

938
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,519
chart they release which shows kind of

939
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,079
like an upwards diagram of the different

940
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,358
ppfd numbers across the footprint many

941
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,160
companies were called out in the past

942
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,920
for lying on that so what i did was i

943
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,279
got those grow lights

944
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,119
took the par measurements at the

945
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,720
different distances and then showed it

946
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,400
to my audience and made them make their

947
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,239
own decision on whether or not they

948
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
wanted to to buy that girl light and

949
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,000
also help with like distance as well

950
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,920
kind of seeing what the ppfd is it'll

951
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,320
help them dial in that grow light but i

952
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,639
ended up stopped doing those videos a

953
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,200
couple years back because i got number

954
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,799
one i got tired of it and uh also there

955
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,078
were some other guys out there that do

956
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,599
better reviews and i was like you know

957
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,680
what just start watching their videos

958
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,599
because they do a better more better job

959
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,519
than i do so

960
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,079
and there's also something to be said

961
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,480
for the fact that the the exaggeration

962
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,519
of the par ratings that you mentioned

963
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,440
has improved significantly uh they don't

964
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,358
exaggerate so much and part of the

965
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,159
reason is they don't have to now

966
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,880
nowadays they can shoot the part

967
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,159
higher than it needs to go frankly yeah

968
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,838
i mean there are companies like viper

969
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,000
spectre for example that'll proudly put

970
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,440
a lower number than their competitors

971
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,920
because of the fact that we talked about

972
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,000
too much light at the end right earlier

973
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,599
we talked about too much light

974
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,519
they put really they built their

975
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,440
fixtures for the right amount of light

976
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,719
to hit the plants you know at their

977
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,920
canopy

978
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,919
where other grow lights they're

979
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,200
advertising you know 1200 1500 plus ppfd

980
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
which

981
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,679
you really need co2 in order to be able

982
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,920
to intake that amount of light and these

983
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,598
studies have showed that but yeah the

984
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,119
par meter another one worth mentioning

985
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,280
would be the spot on par meter which uh

986
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,280
apparently shows very similar readings

987
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,519
to the apogee meters but they're a lot

988
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,160
cheaper so if somebody's listening maybe

989
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,838
check out spot on meter

990
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:59,039
and then there are a lot of people using

991
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,838
phone apps now to do measurements right

992
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,358
have you tested any of the phone apps

993
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,799
that are out there to measure light

994
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,119
output at all

995
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,039
yeah i've had a couple of the phone apps

996
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,160
approach me uh

997
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,480
wanting to test them out i've tried one

998
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,440
i've had some buddies who've tried more

999
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,599
of the

1000
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,880
uh phone apps i haven't used them too

1001
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,720
much just because i have a par meter and

1002
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,440
i have a lumen meter so i just don't

1003
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,598
have much use for them uh but my

1004
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,639
personal opinion is that i'm quite

1005
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,599
skeptical of all the phone apps i think

1006
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,679
that the majority of phones simply lack

1007
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,960
the right hardware

1008
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,679
uh to figure out par or light intensity

1009
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,358
properly so what they're giving you is a

1010
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,440
really rough type of idea instead and

1011
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,358
you know on the plus side it's very

1012
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,760
cheap but in my view if you're looking

1013
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,078
for the cheaper chicken so to speak

1014
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,040
just get a lumen meter they're like

1015
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,320
35 40 bucks they're not too expensive

1016
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,838
yeah i think a lot of people can get

1017
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,160
away with just that lumen meter like you

1018
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,318
mentioned so talking about the

1019
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,920
different stages of growth how much

1020
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,079
light do you suggest

1021
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,039
for the different stages of growth yeah

1022
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,800
so

1023
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,838
this is probably kind of the meat and

1024
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,440
potatoes for a lot of people watching um

1025
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,519
because that that's what people really

1026
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,559
want to know is exactly how much do they

1027
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,960
need

1028
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:25,480
and um as i've mentioned in some of my

1029
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,639
own videos because of the uh selling by

1030
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,599
manufacturers and and the anteing up of

1031
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,078
lights the past few years uh some people

1032
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,000
are confused about the maximum that

1033
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,760
these medical plants

1034
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,880
are able to handle so first off i'll say

1035
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,280
that

1036
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,440
if you take sunlight that's shining in

1037
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,839
the middle of a summer's day directly

1038
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,519
from overhead that's something to the

1039
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:54,799
tune of 95 000 lux

1040
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,599
and uh as far as we can tell

1041
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,079
uh

1042
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,160
these plants cannot handle more than

1043
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,880
half of that roughly so about 45 000 lux

1044
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,719
so beyond that at any stage of growth

1045
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,079
you're giving them more than they can

1046
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,358
really take in

1047
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,760
as far as how much they really need so

1048
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,799
let's first do this in in lux and then

1049
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,640
in par

1050
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,839
so in lux for vegetative phase uh you

1051
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,279
need somewhere from an absolute low of 8

1052
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,078
000 lux

1053
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,079
to 13 000 lux and some people are

1054
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,640
surprised by how low those numbers are

1055
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,480
but it'll grow and it'll work at those

1056
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:38,719
numbers uh flowering uh you can do from

1057
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,199
a low of 10 000 lux to a high of 30 000

1058
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,399
lux though ideally you want to be closer

1059
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,960
to the high

1060
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,680
rather than to the low because flowering

1061
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,358
will proceed at 10 000 lux but isn't

1062
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,598
gonna yield right

1063
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,719
at 10 000 lux so

1064
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,440
uh try to hit closer to 30 and you also

1065
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,399
have the ability to go the whole way

1066
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,800
through

1067
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,599
at between about 25 and 28 000 lux for

1068
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,400
both veg and flour and the plants will

1069
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,800
be extremely comfortable with that and

1070
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,639
like i said there's no need to go above

1071
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,359
45 000.

1072
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,639
now when we talk about par

1073
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,358
uh par kinda breaks down into three

1074
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,039
three levels of intensity uh first

1075
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:26,239
there's the level of intensity you'd

1076
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,079
want for your seedlings your clones and

1077
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,318
your mothers that you're trying to keep

1078
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,000
at low pace and you're looking for about

1079
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,480
250 to 400

1080
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,960
uh for your readings for par

1081
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,240
uh during vegetative phase you're gonna

1082
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,800
want about four to six hundred uh on

1083
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,279
your par and then for flowering phase

1084
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,000
you're gonna want between six and nine

1085
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,680
hundred per par uh maybe scraping

1086
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,039
towards a thousand

1087
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:57,440
and uh i i've told people many times if

1088
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,440
you're going well above a thousand

1089
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,679
you're not getting a whole lot for your

1090
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,960
uh extra

1091
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,879
electrical input and as you said you can

1092
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,838
increase a little bit what plants can

1093
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,800
handle

1094
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,920
uh by injecting co2 into the equation

1095
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,880
and so forth but uh yeah there's no

1096
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,519
sense going into the super high figures

1097
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,358
um it's it's just not giving you a whole

1098
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,199
lot yeah i think those are some good

1099
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,400
general ranges i actually use the same

1100
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,799
ones for par that you use but general

1101
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,680
ranges i think that's what's important

1102
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,599
there is some people stick to it

1103
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,358
real hard and they think that if they're

1104
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,039
going outside of that at all that

1105
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,838
they're failing but the plant will still

1106
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,239
grow right you could have a plant in

1107
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:44,159
flowering we give it 400 to 600 ppfd and

1108
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,639
it will still grow it'll still flower

1109
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,480
just the yield might not be optimal

1110
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,440
yeah it's it's not going to die it's not

1111
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,639
going to

1112
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,720
experience any particular deficiency

1113
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,759
as related to nutrients because you're

1114
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:01,199
running it like that um but it's just

1115
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
not needed and i've been amazed i've

1116
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,000
seen um

1117
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:10,719
i've seen vegetative rooms that were

1118
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,599
actually running at about uh 6 000 lux

1119
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,439
and uh they were running and everything

1120
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,519
was fine and this was in a commercial

1121
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,679
setting so yeah

1122
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,759
things can go low because remember like

1123
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,838
out in the real world these plants you

1124
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,480
know things aren't always perfect

1125
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:29,679
sometimes they're slightly in the shade

1126
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,760
somewhere some there's a tree nearby

1127
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,239
and they gotta get through all of that

1128
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,319
uh out in the natural world

1129
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,519
cloudy days is another thing that can

1130
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,199
affect it so yeah there are a lot of

1131
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,960
things that can affect light intensity

1132
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:42,879
particularly when you're outdoors it

1133
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,440
changes throughout the day

1134
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,559
now how about dli that's something that

1135
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,159
a lot of people now aim for is they look

1136
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,119
at the par numbers but they're also

1137
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:56,159
doing a calculation for dli do you look

1138
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,880
at dli at all or no no i actually don't

1139
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,759
i i just don't bother i i was happy with

1140
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
with once i got the par right i used to

1141
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,680
be unhappy slightly with the limitations

1142
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,799
of lumens

1143
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:11,199
particularly as we started getting leds

1144
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,000
out there but once i had power

1145
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,519
measurements i was happy with that i

1146
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,440
don't think you have to go further at

1147
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,679
least that's my personal opinion the

1148
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,519
general ranges that you recommend falls

1149
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,399
within the dli

1150
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:27,280
40 dli is what a lot of people aim for

1151
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,039
upwards of 60 dli now i know there's

1152
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,839
some argument between

1153
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,440
auto flowers and photo period plants and

1154
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:35,279
you do the math on that right if you're

1155
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,639
staying on an 18 6 life cycle for

1156
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,079
example and you've got 900 p pfd that's

1157
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,279
going to give you about i think it's

1158
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,760
almost 60 dli which is kind of the top

1159
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,599
of it so those ranges you mentioned i

1160
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,520
think are good for both photo period as

1161
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,760
well as autoflowering would you agree or

1162
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,800
disagree yeah yeah and that's the thing

1163
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,440
is autoflowers kind of confuse some some

1164
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,880
elements of it and uh it's a bit of an

1165
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,000
issue because autoflowers are so popular

1166
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,079
now and they've gotten so big so yeah so

1167
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,920
there are a lot of people who are brand

1168
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,480
new to this right they're just getting

1169
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,240
started growing for the first time

1170
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,159
what tips do you have

1171
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,239
in regards to lighting for those that

1172
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,719
are growing for the first time yeah well

1173
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,598
i mean i often deal with a lot of folks

1174
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,199
who uh email me because it's their first

1175
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,880
go around and they're having some

1176
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:29,598
problems uh interestingly in the area of

1177
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,000
lighting the number one problem with

1178
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,559
lighting is often that

1179
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,639
the first time you set it up you allow a

1180
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,639
light leak to happen during the dark

1181
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,440
hours that's actually one of the most

1182
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:44,000
common mistakes i see so however you set

1183
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,559
up your lights do uh you know go into

1184
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,480
your tent turn on the lights outside the

1185
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,880
tent and make sure there's no light

1186
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,240
leaks into there because uh those can

1187
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,200
really hurt you

1188
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,919
but uh beyond that uh don't get the

1189
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,279
distance wrong uh which is a common

1190
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,680
mistake uh most often with led lights uh

1191
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,599
people hang them too far away and they

1192
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,719
lose a lot of light intensity over the

1193
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,200
distance

1194
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,919
while those growing with hid lights

1195
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,879
often hang the lights too close and they

1196
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,440
cause heat stress at the canopy and they

1197
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,720
often don't discover that it's happening

1198
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,400
until uh either the leaves start to cop

1199
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:27,439
on them a little bit or the vods develop

1200
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,559
bleaching which is uh kind of this pure

1201
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,519
whiteness

1202
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,880
uh right near the tips that's

1203
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:34,960
undesirable and it means that your

1204
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,079
lights are too close

1205
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,800
and

1206
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,680
finally when it comes to newbies who set

1207
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,920
up multiple lights uh there's a lot of

1208
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,239
mistakes that get made people often will

1209
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,639
put lights way too close

1210
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,000
to one another and overshoot what they

1211
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,639
need for par

1212
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,599
and overshoot how many lights they need

1213
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:57,679
in a certain square footage and then

1214
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,640
they think it's not a big deal but here

1215
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:04,159
they are spending every single day

1216
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:06,400
30 percent more electricity than uh they

1217
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,039
gotta spend and that's where something

1218
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,960
like a light meter of any kind might

1219
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,960
come in handy a little bit to see just

1220
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,760
how much you're over shooting

1221
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,519
uh but i will say to all people who are

1222
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,240
new to it uh the reason i spend so much

1223
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:25,759
time dealing with lighting on my channel

1224
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:29,199
um is lighting is that important it's

1225
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,920
the be-all end-all of indoor-growing

1226
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:34,639
you can make all sorts of mistakes

1227
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,200
that your plants will survive

1228
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,480
but you know if for whatever reason your

1229
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:43,199
lights go off for three four days

1230
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,318
that's gonna really be punishing

1231
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,558
so yeah just gotta be careful and also

1232
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,440
don't overload

1233
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,720
don't overload your breakers guys

1234
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,200
uh a breaker is often rated for at most

1235
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:01,118
1500 watts and you really don't want to

1236
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:03,199
run more than 1200 watts on it

1237
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,318
when you're running it most of the day

1238
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:08,960
so just bear that in mind safety first

1239
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,800
those are some really good tips for sure

1240
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,800
so wrapping things up how can the

1241
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,318
listeners find you and what do you have

1242
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,200
