1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
coming up on Garden talk same way that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,318
you would see a tropical forest Run

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,359
itself or a woodland run itself that's

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,039
how I tend to think of no-till is not

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,199
disturbing the soil and just let it do

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,660
it it was naturally designed to do so

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll take 30 percent of good native soil

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,640
from my food forest and I'll use that to

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,278
create my beds because what better way

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,320
to introduce fungal and bacterial life

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,300
than to take it from somewhere that's

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,618
shown and proved that it can sustain

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,599
something way bigger than what you're

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,460
attempting to do I see no point in being

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,020
organic and going no-till and still have

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,000
to feed the same way that the synthetic

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,380
guys have to feed and still stay on the

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,960
same cycle that they have to feed

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,059
because somehow in nature this process

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,920
happens by itself I don't have to worry

21
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,479
about mixing bottles of nutrients and

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
having this and running out of this I

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,599
don't have to deal with any of that no

24
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,279
more now I can actually just enjoy

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,939
growing

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,939
foreign

27
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:59,519
what's up everybody if you that don't

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
know me my name is Chris aka Mr grew it

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,719
and you're tuned into the garden Talk

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
podcast this episode number 87. in this

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,320
episode I interview Beast Coast grower

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,260
he was on the podcast in the past

33
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,819
episode number 34 and a countless number

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,978
of you have requested for me to bring

35
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,139
him back for another episode in this

36
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,539
episode he talks about no-till farming

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,040
how he goes about doing it thanks to all

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,618
of you who support this podcast through

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,340
patreon if you'd like to support you can

40
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:28,019
do so by going to patreon.com Mr Grow it

41
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,520
before we get into it I want to

42
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,399
acknowledge that one of my goals for

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,679
this podcast is to bring zero cost for

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,079
information about gardening all plants

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,880
to the general public that being said

46
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,500
I'd like to thank the sponsors of

47
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,078
today's episode who helped make that

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,478
goal possible thanks to vivosun for

49
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,639
sponsoring this episode vivosun recently

50
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,560
released the smart grow system this

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Marco system helps streamline the

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
growing process by automating a stage of

53
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,819
growth requirements on and off schedules

54
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,159
spectral range airflow and circulation

55
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,500
and even records useful data about your

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,359
environment it is Wi-Fi capable and

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,040
connects to the vivosun app so you can

58
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,399
control your grow space from your

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,319
smartphone check out their website at

60
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,539
vivosun.com I will provide a link in the

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,299
YouTube description section below AC

62
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,098
Infinity is sponsoring this episode they

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,160
have two different series LED grow

64
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:23,159
lights the ion board and the ion grid

65
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:27,180
the ion board fixtures are board style

66
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,340
and use Samsung LM 301b diodes while the

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,700
ion grid series has an open Center

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,500
design and uses Samsung

69
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:36,000
lm301h diodes I'll have a link in the

70
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,860
description section below so you can

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,259
learn more about these grow lights and

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,080
you can use discount code Mr Grow it if

and we are back welcome to the Garden

79
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,459
Talk podcast today I am joined with

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
Beast Coast grower how you doing today

81
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:04,319
I'm great enjoying the day

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
same here so you're back for a second

83
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,639
time around first time you talked about

84
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,318
how you do plant training and the scrog

85
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,619
technique in particular which people

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,839
loved I mean that episode passed 67 000

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,599
views on YouTube and what pretty

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,039
mind-blowing uh there really have been a

89
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,859
countless number of people requesting

90
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:26,400
you to come back for a part two so here

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,260
we are thank you everybody yeah this

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,939
time around we're going to talk no-till

93
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,158
farming this is the way that you

94
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,500
currently grow and I'm excited to hear

95
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,000
all about it but first can you introduce

96
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,219
yourself for those that didn't catch the

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
first episode we did together yes so for

98
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,120
everybody tuning in I'm Beast Coast

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,519
grower420

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,200
um kind of in a permaculture that's what

101
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm mainly known for doing a whole bunch

102
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,179
of fruits and vegetables and everything

103
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,339
also co-host to the green table podcast

104
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,200
um it's just good to be back glad you

105
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,598
guys like the first one

106
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,339
um that I'm really simple like everybody

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,959
else I'm just somebody who fell in love

108
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,939
with plants not pretty straightforward

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,039
there and so you've done a whole bunch

110
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,560
of different styles of growing in the

111
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,019
past but right now you're into no-till

112
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,759
farming so I have a lot of beginners and

113
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,500
intermediate folks that tune into my

114
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,179
podcast I do have some Advanced folks as

115
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,040
well but I feel like a majority is

116
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,439
beginner and intermediate some people

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,720
might not know what no-till farming is

118
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,759
so can you break it down for us what is

119
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,460
no-till farming well in my opinion

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,100
no-till farming is not disturbing the

121
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,439
soil not disturbing the mycelium layer

122
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,879
that's getting built not disturbing that

123
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,800
connection of roots that's happening

124
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,779
inside of the soil like some people will

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,960
go through break the soil up after each

126
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,819
round reamend it put it back uh no-till

127
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,099
is more of a sustainable way of growing

128
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,079
where you don't actually deserve disturb

129
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,600
the soil other than you transplanting

130
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,279
back into it so to me no-till is just

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,960
letting the Earth be the Earth that's

132
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,899
the best way I can describe it the same

133
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,239
way that you would see uh a tropical

134
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,519
forest Run itself or a woodland run

135
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,259
itself uh that that's how I tend to

136
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,000
think of no-till is not disturb Urban

137
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,860
soil and just let it do it it was

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,160
naturally designed to do what's the

139
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,319
downside of disturbing the soil uh break

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
mainly to mycelium that fungal Colony

141
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,800
that builds in the soil you you don't

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,259
really want to disturb that connection

143
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,180
because once the roots connected at it

144
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,680
starts pulling nutrients from distances

145
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,780
that it normally wouldn't have been able

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,759
to and the more you disturb that the

147
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,559
less microbes you have the less fungal

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,538
life that you have the more you're going

149
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,339
to have to amend like now you're going

150
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,560
to have to actually put food back into

151
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,299
it because you're not able to you don't

152
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,180
have that same access you normally would

153
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,180
yeah those mycelium networks can extend

154
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,220
for miles and miles and miles I watched

155
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,740
it's one of the biggest organisms on the

156
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,020
planet yeah yeah it's it's amazing how

157
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,418
big those networks are I mean you talked

158
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,918
about the old growth growth forests out

159
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,899
there and I watched the documentary

160
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,779
fantastic fungi not sure if you've seen

161
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:57,659
that one it talks all about it yeah and

162
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,059
uh it's crazy how how long the network

163
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,100
actually extends to and the fact that

164
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,519
nutrients can be can't be transported

165
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,039
from so far away into the plant you know

166
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,219
so and it's always weird how like they

167
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,839
discuss like microbes they discuss mpk

168
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,940
they discuss a whole bunch of other

169
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,279
stuff and for some reason fungal is

170
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,779
really kind of left out it's like that

171
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,758
that thing you don't really want to talk

172
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,198
about and I get it when it comes to like

173
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,819
a lot of mushrooms you don't exactly

174
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,560
know which you can eat that'll harm you

175
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,539
and what you can eat that'll help you so

176
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,459
I get it it's kind of a gray area but

177
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,620
when it comes to the plants this should

178
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,079
be one of the first topics that's spoken

179
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,639
about yeah good point I felt kind of I

180
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,339
felt kind of cheated after I seen

181
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,840
fantastic fungi like wait a minute have

182
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,519
we been focusing on a lot of the wrong

183
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,500
things today

184
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,139
yeah a lot of people are using you know

185
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,060
chemicals and salts that's one way of

186
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,418
growing or there's the organic side of

187
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,519
things and and nove-till goes right with

188
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:56,579
that right so let's start with the media

189
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,038
or medium uh what do you use for that

190
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,779
when no-till farming it's a bunch of

191
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,459
different ways you can start and I know

192
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,079
the way that I'm gonna say a lot of

193
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,579
people don't agree with you're going to

194
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,978
hear a bunch of people tell you that

195
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,038
that's crazy don't do that but what I

196
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,839
choose to do is I like the Pro mix BX uh

197
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,120
is people don't know there's a different

198
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,859
type of Pro mix there's the HP that's

199
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,360
the high porosity one that's the one you

200
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,120
would mainly use if you were going to do

201
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,280
more synthetic feeding the BX is a

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,079
heavier Pro mix that you can use that's

203
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,818
mainly used for like no-till if you're

204
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,620
going to build a system where that soil

205
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,740
is going to stay put you would rather go

206
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,180
with the pro-mix BX now another thing I

207
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,120
did in the beds that I know people won't

208
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,360
agree with is my beds are 30 native soil

209
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,459
so I'll take 30 of good native soil from

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,098
my food forest and I'll use that to

211
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,680
create my beds because what better way

212
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:48,719
to introduce fungal and bacterial life

213
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,639
than to take it from somewhere that's

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,020
shown and prove that it can sustain

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
something way bigger than what you're

216
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,120
attempting to do so I like to take 30

217
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,780
native soil and also add it but I also

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,699
use uh Happy Frog and

219
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,638
some I don't have a problem with ocean

220
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,379
Forest but it can run a bit hot so it's

221
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,000
something that I tread lightly on and if

222
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,098
I was to use it it would be in the very

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,500
bottoms of the beds but that that's the

224
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:17,879
medium that I like to go with is 30

225
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,939
native soil 70 Pro mix or maybe added at

226
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,000
70 maybe take 20 percent of that and use

227
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,699
maybe uh Fox Farm Happy Frog or ocean

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,800
force or maybe another one uh I know

229
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,660
they have the Malibu compost and they

230
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,639
have a other ones on build the soil you

231
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,680
can use as well yeah I hear about more

232
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,240
and more people using the native soil in

233
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,319
their backyard and just grabbing that

234
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,580
and rehabbing it I guess you can call it

235
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,919
and that's where the Pro mix comes in

236
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,660
here right right so that way it's not

237
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,699
too compact because a lot of these

238
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,679
plants of course we know that oxygen is

239
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,759
needed down in the root Zone some of

240
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,259
these native soils are going to be too

241
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,600
Compact and you're just not going to get

242
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,179
optimal growth out of it so adding in

243
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,639
pro-mix adding in some of the the bag

244
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,079
soil that you use could certainly be

245
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,580
beneficial on that Avenue

246
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,100
yeah it's going to come with your

247
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,540
perlite or your vermiculite uh some wood

248
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,980
chips are going to be inside of there

249
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,500
there's going to be things in there that

250
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,700
help to aerate and and let the water get

251
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,278
through that's another thing if you have

252
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,080
heavy clay soils you you stand that

253
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,820
chance of a lot of your water not being

254
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,379
able to even penetrate through if you

255
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,019
don't mix it right so that's the reason

256
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,240
I only go 30 instead of 50 50 because

257
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,519
you can still risk compaction if you go

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,899
50 50. depending on if you don't mix it

259
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,500
right so I'd rather stay on the safe

260
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:34,080
side with the 30 70. is this for your

261
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,778
indoor garden or outdoor Garden indoor

262
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,339
okay both actually I'll if I had to

263
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:41,399
build beds outdoor I would build them

264
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,560
the exact same way okay got it and then

265
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,539
what else do you abandon to the medium

266
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,458
begin like some folks will do some sort

267
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,319
of amendments that have you know

268
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:52,259
nutrients in that obviously break down

269
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,260
are you adding anything else into the

270
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:58,799
medium to begin yes uh when I first make

271
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,019
the beds um there's 444

272
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,719
um what is that down to earth yeah down

273
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:08,879
to earth 444 uh Lang benite kelp

274
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,379
and maybe some Epsom salt Epsom salt is

275
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,120
super important it is something they

276
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,000
always leave out when it's time to amend

277
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,259
is Epsom salt but that calcium uptake is

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,480
important and you can't do it without

279
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,159
magnesium so I make sure that I always

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,899
add some Epsom salt to them too and

281
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,299
besides that that's it the beds run

282
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,480
themselves after that I know oh and also

283
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,759
human do you know offhand the ratios

284
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,300
that you use like the amount you

285
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,519
actually put in to the soil at all or no

286
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,679
I know they're supposed to be uh you use

287
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,778
a cup of this or half a cup of this I

288
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,699
eyeball it I'm not gonna lie like a chef

289
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,740
or just a little bit of this something a

290
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,740
little sprinkle of this yes

291
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,240
making sure that 444 be the uh bulk of

292
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,980
it of whatever I'm going to be using

293
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
because that's the main source of mpk

294
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,820
that they're going to be getting the

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,200
langva Knight is really it's slow

296
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
release so the langba Knight will get

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,259
released later but that's a potassium

298
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,778
Source

299
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,700
um so so I make sure that I add that and

300
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,620
that and again it depends on the layer

301
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,240
because I layer my beds like lasagna so

302
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,039
at the bottom there will be a stronger

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
layer of amendments than it will be at

304
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,059
the top because you don't want to put

305
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,739
Plants right into hot soil like if

306
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,539
peppers are burned up tomatoes are burnt

307
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,278
you don't want to deal with that so you

308
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,480
you want to go as light as possible on

309
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,639
the top because plants don't need as

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,259
much nutrients as they say they do so

311
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,120
really light on the top and it can get

312
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,458
heavier as it gets to the bottom okay

313
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,459
and then you mentioned you're in beds or

314
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:32,518
do you also or you also grow pots I use

315
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:35,099
I have I have some smart pots too what

316
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,200
size do you use and well what size do

317
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,700
you recommend at least seven you're

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,339
gonna need at least seven gallons I know

319
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,560
most people say five uh five is a pretty

320
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,899
safe Zone but when you're gonna have to

321
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,278
keep bad in layers of hay and and other

322
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,659
things eventually you're just you're

323
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,578
going to need a little bit more so I

324
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:53,219
like to go with seven fill it to five

325
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,958
and and leave that last two because

326
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,639
eventually it'll get filled up over time

327
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,259
and I don't I don't want to deal with

328
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,720
that and wind up having to switch these

329
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,559
pots out so at bare minimum of seven but

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,839
I use 20s yeah I use threes five sevens

331
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,659
and the sevens are our easiest you know

332
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,700
see easier it is sevens are the best and

333
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm gonna be trying tens and trying for

334
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,259
for larger ones as well so you know a

335
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,740
lot of people say that the larger the

336
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,379
grow pot or bed the easier it is it is

337
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,299
it is and you know what I have 20s but I

338
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,860
have them folded down to tens and after

339
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,719
each round you'll notice you'll have to

340
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,579
fold the bag up a little bit more fold

341
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,079
the bag up a little bit more so that's

342
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:32,599
what happens over time

343
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,399
oh that's interesting so you actually

344
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,620
folding down the sides of it and then

345
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,958
kind of unraveling It Grow off to grow

346
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,940
and yes because you're gonna have to add

347
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,439
another layer of mulch is going to

348
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,880
heighten it and you don't want to have

349
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,660
to water and then your water is running

350
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,159
off after a while

351
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:54,240
everything on the bottom will eventually

352
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,039
turn into a compost or worm castings and

353
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,539
that's what you'll be able to that

354
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,399
that's what's going to keep on raising

355
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,679
the height of it that's a good technique

356
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,379
so the hail disappear but it'll leave a

357
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,539
whole bunch of uh insect Frost or worm

358
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,000
castings whatever got it that makes

359
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,519
sense so when does your first feeding

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,759
happen and what does it consist of

361
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,379
but it so I'm going into the beds I'm in

362
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,240
veg I'm just getting the plants in there

363
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,778
for the first time yeah they're not

364
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,459
going to get a first feeding for a month

365
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,799
and then what do you typically do for

366
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:29,638
the that feeding

367
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,778
uh uh ferments so fpjs will be one of

368
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,339
the first things that I'm going to be

369
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,620
feeding because after they veg for that

370
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,540
month they'll be transitioning into the

371
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,459
flower stages and at that point that's

372
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,139
when I wanna I wanna boost the potassium

373
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:43,979
the phosphorus everything else so I'll

374
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,899
go with fpj feeding fpj fermented plant

375
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,360
juice okay so you're doing a natural

376
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,458
farming technique there for your first

377
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,079
feeding can you talk about fpj and like

378
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,879
how you go about doing that it just

379
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,179
makes sense for me to do ferments

380
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,620
because I'm vegan so most of the stuff

381
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,679
that I'm throwing away is reusable

382
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,139
anyway so I mainly just ferment the

383
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,299
fruits and the vegetables separately the

384
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,000
vegetables that I firm it that's for veg

385
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,679
the fruits that I ferment those are for

386
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,659
Bloom so you wind up with two almost

387
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,278
separate nutrients and you can use them

388
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,078
at whatever stage that you want to do

389
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,939
that works best I just normally never

390
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,739
need them in veg because they don't take

391
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,019
a lot of nutrients in veg especially in

392
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,060
big beds so my ferment process is

393
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,440
actually to take the fruit

394
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,599
um some people use brown sugar some

395
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
people use white sugar I like Agave I

396
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,079
don't know why I like Agave but it's

397
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,539
just something I always have on hand so

398
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,338
I'll take the Agave let it sit for a

399
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,099
week and a half after a week and a half

400
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,620
strain it take the juices from it dilute

401
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,079
that probably like three milliliters to

402
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,860
a gallon and and that's what I'll use to

403
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,819
feed what's the shelf life on fpj

404
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,500
truthfully I don't know they said the

405
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,500
longer you sit sometimes the better it

406
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,539
gets if you can store it properly but I

407
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,159
try to make mine small batches at a time

408
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,539
so I don't have them sitting around too

409
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,639
long to wind up just having to throw

410
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,500
them away so I'll do them as needed and

411
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,419
in the meantime any of that extra stuff

412
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,100
will just go into the worm bin but when

413
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,899
I know I want to do a feeding coming up

414
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,659
within the next week or so that's when

415
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,799
I'll go ahead and make the fpj that

416
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,019
makes sense and then are you just

417
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,359
following like the recipe that say Chris

418
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,459
Trump for example is a well-known

419
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
natural Farmer on YouTube and he has

420
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,659
step-by-step instructions on how to do

421
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,638
the technique or you just phone his

422
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,139
technique or is there some other thing

423
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,139
that you're doing besides what he does

424
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,698
I'll do mixture of what I can from some

425
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,259
of these people and what I can't because

426
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,179
they're in different areas they have

427
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,220
access to different live plants they

428
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,259
have like some people use banana flour

429
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,060
like there's no way for me to get that

430
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,338
where I'm at Banana bananas just don't

431
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,958
grow where I'm at so I just try to fuse

432
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,760
the two so I'll take some of the stuff

433
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,379
that I have access to from some of these

434
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,360
people and the rest of it is literally

435
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,100
just kitchen scraps and that that makes

436
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,419
life the easiest for me because I know

437
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,920
that uh if you're thinking like

438
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,419
cantaloupe you're talking about

439
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,278
something heavy in phosphorus and

440
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:58,198
potassium it's a big bulky fruit you

441
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,939
know phosphorus and potassium you

442
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,179
everyone knows bananas are full of

443
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,040
potassium so I I try to think of it by

444
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,599
nutrient value like what's inside of

445
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,539
these fruits that I'm going to be using

446
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,399
and what part of growing would I like to

447
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,659
add these in so I may be a little

448
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,198
different than some of the other ones

449
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:18,838
got it so you're first feeding is fpj

450
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,759
fermented plant juice and then after

451
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,620
that I assume that you're kind of

452
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,319
already flipped a flower at that point

453
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,940
so you're doing fermented fruit juice is

454
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,800
that right sure as your second feeding

455
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,540
yes yes I forgot there's a difference

456
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,578
there's the fermented fruit juice and

457
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,620
the fermented plant juice I say that the

458
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:36,958
plant juice is for veg and the fruit

459
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,980
juice is for flour okay yeah I've heard

460
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,299
a lot of people that do the natural

461
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,680
farming techniques that's what they've

462
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,799
been doing or you could just make a full

463
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,539
spectrum blend and you basically have a

464
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,120
one-part nutrient that you can use all

465
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:50,219
the way through huh okay that's awesome

466
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,799
that's pretty cool and then you're doing

467
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,660
a third feeding after that I try my best

468
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,639
not to have to feed

469
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,799
um so it's rare that I feed I'm straight

470
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,600
water from beginning to end like if they

471
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,120
go check the rounds that I have recently

472
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,699
those are ran off water for the most

473
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,740
part I'll feed if I decide to but if not

474
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,660
they still they still hold steady that's

475
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,699
mainly just the microbial feeding or if

476
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,919
I want to boost the bacterial fungi or

477
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,539
something but they don't exactly need

478
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,459
the feedings after you build the beds

479
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,019
right if you if you've got the worms in

480
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,298
there and if you're doing the method

481
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,980
that I use then you're constantly making

482
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,480
worm castings and Foods you don't have

483
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,039
to worry about it so how do you know

484
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,140
when how do you know when to feed feed

485
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,659
it's really up to you so if you're in

486
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,700
weak if you're in week two or a flower

487
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,220
and you're trying to get uh more flower

488
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,019
sites and more flowers to develop and

489
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,339
you want to boost that you see you see

490
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,038
it and you think you just want to boost

491
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,139
that go ahead and add a feeding if you

492
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,058
get into week five and you want to do a

493
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,620
little bit more bulking feel free to go

494
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,019
ahead and use the same way that you

495
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,279
would use any other PK booster is the

496
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,720
same way that you would use this the

497
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,879
only difference is you're not feeding in

498
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,319
between time you're only targeting those

499
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,900
specific points where you just want to

500
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,759
boost something because I I see no point

501
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,320
in being organic and going no-till and

502
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,119
still have to feed the same way that the

503
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,798
synthetic guys have to feed and still

504
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,319
stay on the same cycle that they have to

505
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,960
feed because somehow in nature this

506
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,178
process happens by itself no no one's

507
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,038
there feeding anything and yet these

508
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,200
trees grow to hundreds of feet and they

509
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,538
do just fine I try to replicate that

510
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,980
same method understood yeah I know a lot

511
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,379
of people doing the natural farming

512
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,179
technique and no-till but they're also

513
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,539
doing like some people use the organic

514
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,460
Blends and they'll top dress at certain

515
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,200
times typically some people do got 30

516
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,819
days into it to do a top dress then

517
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,100
every 30 days after that they'll do a

518
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,200
top dress and they'll just really just

519
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,119
top dress in the water after that so it

520
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,160
seems to be like the similar frequency

521
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,659
to what you're doing with the ferments

522
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,940
so would you say that's just kind of an

523
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,058
alternate way to go about the no-till

524
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,919
yes and the ferments are readily

525
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,139
available immediately like the reason

526
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,880
that they have to feed 30 days in or are

527
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,740
the time after that is because that has

528
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,260
to take time to break down so if I'm

529
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,779
gonna want a feeding week two I have to

530
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,879
go two weeks back and already amend it

531
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,139
so two weeks later they're finally

532
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,179
starting to uptake it it's finally

533
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,400
broken down is finally available when it

534
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,780
comes to ferments if I feed today they

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
took that today

536
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,899
so I don't have to worry about it again

537
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,580
afterwards every time I'm watering

538
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,440
afterwards I'm pretty much just diluting

539
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,639
what's already in there God it's a big

540
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,038
difference there and that's definitely a

541
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,538
pro having that readily available you

542
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,460
know especially if you've got a problem

543
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,319
and you need to fix it because in soil

544
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,600
the hardest thing is running into a

545
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,460
problem because sometimes it can take

546
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,139
days before you can fix it and it might

547
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,419
take weeks before it shows that fix

548
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,538
shows up like you're running low on on

549
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,860
nitrogen you you add some nitrogen two

550
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:39,538
weeks later they'll finally start

551
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,219
Greening up but for the two weeks in

552
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,359
between that your plans ain't gonna be

553
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,740
looking good

554
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,798
I think a lot of people start off

555
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,880
organic and they run into the point

556
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,440
where they're seeing deficiencies in

557
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,700
their plants and they'll top dress but

558
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,960
like you said it's gonna you're gonna

559
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,160
wait those two weeks in order for it to

560
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,500
break down I don't think a lot of people

561
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,320
know about the alternative of fpj and

562
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,359
ffj the ferments uh and then being

563
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,519
readily available so instead of

564
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,558
resorting back to synthetic nutrients

565
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,000
the fact that fast acting stuff which I

566
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,798
think a lot of people doing might want

567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,779
to consider going after a ferment since

568
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,000
that is fast reacting than just top

569
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,058
dressing and waiting until the Organics

570
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,740
break down exactly it's just a cheat

571
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,980
sheet like if I if I need something

572
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,140
right now and I know that I created this

573
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,058
ferment out of a whole lot of greens I

574
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,679
know it's loaded with nitrogen and if I

575
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,918
feed this right now they can uptake this

576
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,620
nitrogen right now uh but if I decide to

577
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,179
give them some 444 it's going to be a

578
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:34,918
week or two before they get ready to

579
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,419
uptake that and something else is most

580
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,860
people aren't dealing with deficiencies

581
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,200
when it comes to Soy they're dealing

582
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,178
with toxicities so like you'll go get

583
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,460
your happy frog or you whatever you're

584
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,019
gonna the gate you pop your plan in but

585
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,240
you're also going to run the fox farm

586
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,679
nutrient line right along with it what

587
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,419
they don't tell you is to add water

588
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,860
until that runs its course because

589
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,538
there's there's tons of food in the

590
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,519
Happy Frog and the ocean Forest already

591
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,259
so imagine imagine you're trying to feed

592
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,058
on top of everything that's already

593
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,919
available there you wind up burning your

594
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,779
plant but it shows up like a deficiency

595
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
because you can't tell the difference so

596
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,839
I think most people are not dealing with

597
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,279
deficiencies depending on what they're

598
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,099
using they're dealing with toxicities

599
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,259
and over watering yep I ran into it 10

600
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,719
years ago and 12 years ago when I first

601
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,839
started you know not not realizing that

602
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,140
the dark dark green leaves are actually

603
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:25,199
toxic toxicity right yeah now are you

604
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,380
running into any toxicity issues using

605
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,080
fpj or ffj nope because I don't use it

606
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,179
often okay so you're controlling it now

607
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,980
if I used it if I used it more maybe

608
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,980
because all the nutrients also available

609
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,700
in the soil but I haven't ran into that

610
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,159
problem

611
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,960
I go I'm I'm really easy I try to go as

612
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,580
light as possible on the plants because

613
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,200
there's so much available there and when

614
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,939
you're adding things like ferments that

615
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,558
is feeding the microbes and bacteria

616
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,720
they start releasing more nutrients

617
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,279
available for the plants you you don't

618
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,919
have to really worry about that I think

619
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,599
the synthetic way of us learning just

620
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,799
has us thinking we constantly have to

621
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,839
keep feeding our eventually they're

622
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,000
going to run out but there's so much

623
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,379
food available in that soil that you you

624
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,619
wouldn't believe it especially in a bed

625
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,659
and a pot maybe not as much but it you

626
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,819
you in a four by eight bed that holds

627
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,980
hundreds of gallons of soil like yeah

628
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,359
yeah you're good and that's where having

629
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,740
a bigger container can make things

630
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,798
easier because there's more availability

631
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,000
right yes so you mentioned worms in your

632
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,279
garden I want to get a little bit deeper

633
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,220
into that because a lot of people are

634
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,960
utilizing worms and either containers or

635
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,720
beds when they're growing organically

636
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,759
now there are several different types of

637
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,579
worms that you can use right red

638
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:38,099
wigglers European night crawlers African

639
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,619
nightcrawlers what do you use for worms

640
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:43,259
in your bed I choose the red red

641
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,699
wigglers but I also do add earthworms as

642
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,200
well but they serve two different

643
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,000
purposes

644
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
um red regulars are mainly going to be

645
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,819
at the top they're going to deal with

646
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,960
the composting the things that land on

647
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,700
that top layer they're going to break

648
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,740
all of that downturn that into castings

649
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,080
for you the earthworms on the other hand

650
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,460
they're gonna stay a bit lower and

651
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,960
they're they're going to eat the peat

652
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,179
they're going to eat they eat other

653
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,700
things they handle other processes but

654
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,960
for that top layer to get broken down as

655
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,580
fast as possible you're going to want

656
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
the red wigglers or the African

657
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:11,279
nightcrawl you're going to want the

658
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,139
smaller worms

659
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,119
the thinner worms are mainly used for

660
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,860
composting the bigger thicker worms are

661
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,839
mainly used to create tunnels and do

662
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,119
other things inside of the soil so I do

663
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,279
a mixture of both but I mainly focus on

664
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,038
the red wigglers now are you just

665
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,259
getting the worms from your native soil

666
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,079
that 30 percent does that include worms

667
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,058
are you Outsourcing it are you buying it

668
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,220
somewhere whether it be from a local

669
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:37,678
Walmart in the bait section or whatever

670
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,900
or ordering it online like Uncle Jim's

671
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,940
worm farm is a common source a lot of

672
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,000
people go to where do you get your worms

673
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,640
Uncle Jim yep so I I'll get my worms

674
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,200
from there but I I am still adding worms

675
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,480
all the time like if it's a rainy day

676
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,159
and I know it's done raining I'll go out

677
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,779
lift some bricks up take some of those

678
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,340
worms and bring them right back in as

679
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,139
well just to just to keep them

680
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,199
reproducing instead of having to keep on

681
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,460
adding them why why when they're free

682
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,319
I'll pay for them the first time when I

683
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,759
add them but after that I'm never paying

684
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,259
to add worms again they're gonna I'm

685
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,940
gonna give them every reason to stay

686
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,919
that's another thing people add worms

687
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,600
and give them nothing to do afterwards

688
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,100
like you're going to add composting

689
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,480
worms to it but you're not giving them

690
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,740
anything to compost what are they going

691
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,058
to do eventually they're going to leave

692
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,558
you're going to start digging through

693
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,460
your soil and you won't find worms

694
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,678
anymore and you're going to wonder

695
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,298
what's going on well you sent a bunch of

696
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,320
workers to a job site and there was no

697
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:27,319
work to do so they went home

698
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:33,240
that's funny I I started vermicomposting

699
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,240
last year so I got about a year under my

700
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,099
belt and uh yeah I'm at the point where

701
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,019
I can actually just take some worms from

702
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,819
my vermicompost bin which is it now a

703
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,639
year-round thing and then put it into my

704
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,899
containers as needed so it's a good way

705
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,179
to have them on hand at all times just

706
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,380
have a firmer compost bin exactly and

707
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,360
then every time that you have to clean

708
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,860
it out to harvest the the castings and

709
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,178
everything when you add those castings

710
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,099
they're going to have a bunch of little

711
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,538
worms and eggs and stuff inside of them

712
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,939
and they're going to re-inoculate the

713
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,919
Bed full of worms as long as you got a

714
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,240
layer for them to live in as long as you

715
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,000
got some bedding for them to live in

716
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,919
they'll handle the rest like I added a

717
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,359
thousand worms per four by eight I know

718
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,919
a lot of people would have said use a

719
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,798
whole bunch more but no I added a

720
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,538
thousand her 4x8 gave them a proper

721
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:17,339
environment to live in and now there's

722
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:19,798
there's more than I could ever count

723
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,379
like you'll lift you'll lift a layer

724
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,879
ahead in this thousands of worms yeah

725
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
because they'll reproduce right what do

726
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,179
they make they have to make contact with

727
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,440
each other and then they uh they

728
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,960
reproduce that way or something like

729
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,519
that I think so yeah but they they all

730
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,440
they lay eggs too you'll see them all

731
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,058
through the uh through the hay when you

732
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,798
lift it they lay a bunch of eggs inside

733
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:41,038
of there and that's why you need that

734
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,298
and a lot of people use an avocado Tech

735
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,579
I'm not sure if you've heard about

736
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:46,259
avocado yeah that's uh I have it's a way

737
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:49,199
to attract the worms into one area right

738
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,579
so they'll go after the avocado and then

739
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,259
uh and then once they're making that

740
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,058
contact and they're reproducing so you

741
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,579
can get faster reproduction just by

742
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:58,558
putting avocado face down on the top of

743
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:00,899
the medium yeah that that works too

744
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,000
cover crops let's get into that next

745
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,240
what do you use for cover crops and when

746
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,038
do you plant them uh there's this a a

747
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,778
medium the as soon as I make the beds I

748
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,460
make a layer of cover crop that's the

749
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:13,440
very first thing I do before any other

750
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,659
plants are gone in before anything I'm

751
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,360
going to grow a really thick layer of

752
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,760
cover crop really thick like purposely

753
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,099
I'm gonna let it overgrow itself because

754
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,900
that's going to be the first layer of

755
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:27,778
food and mulch for those beds because

756
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,700
once I hate that over that becomes the

757
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:31,380
first layer of food going in is that

758
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,380
layer of cover crop that happens right

759
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,440
there but uh Harry vetch um the daikon

760
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,778
radishes the Red Clovers the the snow

761
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,778
peas the the regular I think it's like a

762
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:45,058
20c variety that use and that's what I

763
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,339
go along with where did you get the 20c

764
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,500
variety was it locally or probably

765
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,199
Amazon it was like a non it was a

766
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,058
non-GMO uh pack from Amazon a cover crop

767
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,558
and it was like a 20 seed blend I think

768
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,500
I showed it on my Instagram or something

769
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:01,200
the the actual pack of it nice nice yeah

770
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,179
a lot of people buying the 12 seed blend

771
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,159
from Builders soil that seems to be very

772
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,960
popular I've used that before too that

773
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,080
works well too I was just in a rush and

774
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,298
I needed it faster so I chose to go with

775
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,339
Amazon to get them because I needed it

776
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,538
faster but the build the soil one works

777
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:17,819
perfect as well

778
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:20,759
you said you're planting the cover crops

779
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,740
right away so as the cover crops growing

780
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,778
up you have to eventually cut it back

781
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,298
right

782
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:29,579
when do you make that call to cut back

783
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,259
your cover crop uh when they pass the

784
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,058
Ring of the bed so there's a distance

785
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:36,058
between where my soil starts and where

786
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:38,399
the actual bed is once they pass that

787
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,619
that uh that arm rest basically on the

788
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,059
beds that's when it's time to hang them

789
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,619
over some people just cut them back I

790
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,658
hit them over completely that's going to

791
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:48,359
be the first layer of food the worms and

792
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,919
bugs are gonna love me after I smother

793
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,558
that underneath there they're gonna go

794
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,900
crazy and all of that turns into just a

795
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,879
massive layer of worm castings later on

796
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,500
like you'll go back at the end of that

797
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,539
round and then to just be black

798
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,000
underneath there that's another source

799
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:05,940
of nutrition right once you put that

800
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,679
mulch layer over it and it dies off and

801
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,940
the worms are going after it and the

802
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,679
microbes and all that stuff that's

803
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,080
turning into usable nutrients that's the

804
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,480
plant can uptick yes and on top of it

805
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,699
the plants themselves that that want

806
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,860
ended up getting hated over their Roots

807
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,480
start to release nutrients once the once

808
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,859
they notice that the plant's dead so

809
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,298
they'll start to let go of some of the

810
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:26,399
nutrients that they've been holding on

811
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,740
to and you're watering in a worm casting

812
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,298
tea every time you get fresh water so I

813
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,519
can say that I'm not feeding I'm just

814
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,079
giving them fresh water all the time but

815
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,658
I'm not just giving them fresh water

816
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,339
there's such a big layer of thick layer

817
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,559
of worm castings underneath that hay

818
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:43,019
that I'm watering in a worm casting tea

819
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,058
every single time that I water are you

820
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,139
just using the hay as a mulch layer

821
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,639
there are several different things that

822
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,679
you can use I'm not sure if you're

823
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,620
you're just using that is it barley

824
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,840
straw or what exactly is it yeah

825
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,158
or Alfalfa some people use Alfalfa

826
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,139
there's there's a couple different ones

827
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,059
that you can use but yeah but on top of

828
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,220
that I still do chop and drop too so

829
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,899
when I go to Leaf strip or I lollipop

830
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,120
and clean the bottoms all of that goes

831
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,340
to the soil goes right to the soil does

832
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,839
it go on top of the mulch layer are you

833
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,119
lifting up that mulch layer and then

834
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,000
sliding it underneath if it's a new

835
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,558
layer of of straw Then I then I'll

836
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,119
purposely go underneath and put it

837
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,119
because it takes a little while for that

838
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,038
uh straw to flatten uh but but if it's

839
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,839
already been in and it's kind of flat

840
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,278
and compacted already then I'll just

841
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,480
throw it right on top it'll still serve

842
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,220
its purpose eventually it'll just

843
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,319
disappear or it'll turn into a black

844
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,819
spot on top of the straw and then

845
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,619
that'll let you know that it's now a

846
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,200
bunch of insect Frost and worm castings

847
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,418
okay have you used any some people use

848
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,460
wood chips as a mulch layer have you

849
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,500
done that at all or no I don't like wood

850
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,240
chips because since I have to transplant

851
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,159
back into these beds I never want to

852
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,079
risk this these wood chips getting mixed

853
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,760
back into the soil because uh they'll

854
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,199
start to Leach nitrogen they'll cause a

855
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,000
whole bunch of issues being inside of

856
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,058
your soil only good for the very top

857
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,500
layer of your soil if I was outdoor then

858
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:59,700
maybe I would go with wood chips I

859
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,619
wouldn't have as much of a problem with

860
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,700
it but indoor I'm not even messing

861
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,839
around with it I'm just gonna go with

862
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,580
straw

863
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,259
if I use wood chips it's literally

864
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,579
because I put them outside to inoculate

865
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:10,019
them with some microbes and brought them

866
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,839
back afterwards that's the only time

867
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll be using them understood and what

868
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,778
type of water do you use when doing

869
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,538
no-till are using oral water distilled

870
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,579
tap water well water what are you using

871
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:27,778
for a water source they gonna chew me up

872
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,778
in the comments over this one tap

873
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,759
I I don't get what everyone's big issue

874
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,439
with the tap water is go look at your

875
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,898
lawn go look at your garden in the

876
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,640
backyard go look at anywhere else and

877
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,319
it's It's tap water that's doing that

878
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,880
like tap water is not the worst thing in

879
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,519
the world I think mine comes out at

880
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,220
around like 225 or something I think

881
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,740
it's all calcium and whatever it's not I

882
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,079
have mycelium to be able to disinfect it

883
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,359
that's anti-bacterial properties inside

884
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,639
of it I'm not exactly too worried about

885
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,859
that like the once you learn what

886
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,419
mycelium actually does with one layer of

887
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,918
skin compared to ours with like seven

888
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,899
you start thinking about things

889
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,240
completely different like am I am I

890
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:09,058
willing to waste a five to one ratio on

891
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,740
our RO water I'm not I'm not willing to

892
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:13,200
waste five gallons of tap water to make

893
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,599
me one gallon of usable RO water that's

894
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,220
that no I'm cool on that so I'll just

895
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,558
tap water right out the right out the

896
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,460
hose I think mine comes out at three to

897
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,579
one

898
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,740
but still that's that's crazy as far as

899
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:28,379
the uh yeah I'm wasting three gallons

900
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,480
just to get one of of possibly some

901
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,399
better water but possibly tip for

902
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,679
anybody doing that you can always take

903
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,599
your drain line of the RO put into a

904
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,340
bucket and use it elsewhere right your

905
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,319
outdoor plants for example some people

906
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,658
like oh you're wasting it with RO water

907
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,220
but uh you know most people's drains are

908
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,778
going right back into local water

909
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,298
Municipal system so it's not really

910
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:51,240
being wasted yep and now now if I had

911
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,619
bad water like I hear some people's PPM

912
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,380
at the top and I'm like I wouldn't use

913
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,939
that either mine is 485. I I would

914
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,440
filter that in some way shape or form

915
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,960
like I don't care if I created my own

916
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,480
charcoals filters or or no matter in

917
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,120
some way I would filter that water yeah

918
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,940
mine comes out at 485 PPM so I'm just

919
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:11,759
like I've got the RO system I have to do

920
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,380
something it's just yeah in your case it

921
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,500
makes sense it's just a little bit safer

922
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,760
because if I get through if I start

923
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,798
watering my plants I've done this before

924
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,379
I water it with tap water trying to get

925
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,298
through it plants are struggling and I

926
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,100
need the yield right I need the end

927
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:27,658
result off of it and I'm messing up my

928
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:30,058
plants all of a sudden quality goes down

929
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:31,919
the drain well that now my stash is

930
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:34,500
going down the drain too somewhat so

931
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,480
exactly so I I safe side it although I

932
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,819
am revisiting the whole tap water and

933
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,980
trying to use it straight from the top

934
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,898
and I'm trying to get some sort of

935
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,899
result in there and I'm hoping that

936
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:48,000
organic no-till that I'll be able to get

937
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,439
away with it you know it just depends on

938
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,240
what's coming out of it like if you're

939
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,340
getting a bunch of like iron in your

940
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,200
water you're gonna come out with a

941
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,879
problem that that that you won't even

942
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,500
recognize like you'll look at it and be

943
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,419
like am I over watering am I

944
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,798
underwatering like what's going on I've

945
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,360
seen another grower deal with it where

946
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,359
they were trying to keep the water from

947
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,740
the dehumidifier so they would use the

948
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,119
water from the dehumidifier and they

949
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,038
were wondering why the room kept on

950
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,599
having problems and it was because the

951
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,240
extra iron that was coming through the

952
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,038
coils of the dehumidifier that iron was

953
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,960
in the water and just the smallest

954
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,339
percentage of it was burned in the

955
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,019
plants because they don't need the

956
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,119
amount of iron that's coming out of that

957
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:25,798
it's a small percentage to us it's a

958
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,199
large percentage to a plant that doesn't

959
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,179
exactly need it so if I had worse water

960
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,740
then yeah I'd have to have some kind of

961
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,899
system to stop it

962
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,538
that's interesting that that grower came

963
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:39,658
across an issue where iron was leaking

964
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:41,579
in through their dehumidifier I've

965
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,919
actually come across studies where I

966
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:46,439
think it was by like Quest dehumidifier

967
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,600
humidification systems that company they

968
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,980
have a study on theirs they did testing

969
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,859
and everything seemed to be clear on

970
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,200
multiple dehumidifiers but uh but it's

971
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,278
kind of like a as a biased Source I

972
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,679
guess you can say because they're

973
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,839
selling that equipment right Quest also

974
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,700
has a completely different system than

975
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,439
the person who was using this

976
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,960
dehumidifier was using that wasn't a

977
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,539
quest well well they tested other brands

978
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,039
as well I forget exactly what the oh and

979
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:12,358
then they found out that it was they

980
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,159
found out it was cool yeah I think

981
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,980
copper was like there was like Trace

982
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,200
Amounts of copper but that was it like

983
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,059
parts per billion or something like that

984
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,799
so like very small amounts but I have to

985
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,960
revisit that study it's interesting that

986
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,339
that grower came across that and the

987
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,780
moment that they stopped using the water

988
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,279
that they were reclaiming from the

989
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,960
dehumidifier the problem went away in

990
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,119
the garden like this so I could have

991
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,619
just been there dehuman humidifier but

992
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,119
there's there's just instances where

993
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,559
you're gonna need a filter like I'm not

994
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,940
just one of those people that's just all

995
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,639
or nothing we got to be for the

996
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,099
environment we I get that and I love

997
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,659
that but uh if my tap order is coming

998
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,179
out at 480 I'm doing something about

999
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,460
that like I I can't just feed that to my

1000
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,639
plants like you you mix three bottles of

1001
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,320
nutrients and it comes out to 480 like I

1002
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,200
can't have that coming fresh out to tap

1003
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,119
into my plants right yeah I mean the

1004
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,519
elements some cations you know if

1005
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,960
there's excess of some elements they

1006
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,579
could lock out other elements inhibit

1007
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,920
the uptake of other elements so if you

1008
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,380
have a whole bunch of cations of calcium

1009
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
for example it could be inhibiting the

1010
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,240
uptake of magnesium or some of the other

1011
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,280
cations so that balance is certainly

1012
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,019
important now are you phing your water

1013
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,540
no

1014
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:24,300
I think I think my pH of the water is

1015
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:27,420
like 6.3 or something so it comes out in

1016
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,980
the range that is acceptable for for the

1017
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,720
plants that you're growing and then the

1018
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,460
language and stuff like that buffer it

1019
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,338
once it gets inside of the soil so it's

1020
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,159
fine by the time it touches if the water

1021
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:41,460
out of your TAP came in at like 8.0 pH

1022
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,259
would you pH adjustment I'm lowering it

1023
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,500
yeah

1024
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,880
100 yeah again I just lucked up and

1025
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,320
winded up with a situation where

1026
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,420
everything just kind of worked the way

1027
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,920
it was but I know everybody's situation

1028
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,659
isn't going to be like that so if your

1029
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,700
tap water is coming out way too acidic

1030
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:58,379
or way too alkaline do something about

1031
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,480
that I get it you want to be as natural

1032
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,980
as possible find a natural way to lower

1033
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,858
it like there's natural ways to lower

1034
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,240
your pH as well but it does pH Up and

1035
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:08,578
Down ain't the worst thing in the world

1036
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,078
uh get your pH in range to make sure

1037
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,519
that your plants are happy that's the

1038
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,700
that's the end goal is to have happy

1039
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,320
plants so don't be so encased in I don't

1040
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,480
want to use anything that you you're

1041
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,280
willing to sacrifice the round don't do

1042
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,219
that some people worried about using

1043
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,019
those few drops of phosphoric acid lower

1044
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,179
their pH and they think it's just wiping

1045
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,199
out their micro population which isn't

1046
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,960
true you know it's just some

1047
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,639
misinformation that's been passed along

1048
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,559
generation to generation and it's been

1049
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,779
debunked over and over and over again so

1050
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,539
yeah if those folks that are in living

1051
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,460
soils you know growing organically you

1052
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,639
can use a little bit of pH Up and PH

1053
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,800
down and um it's not going to

1054
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,000
drastically harm your population to

1055
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,440
where your plants are going to be all

1056
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,599
screwed up and you're not going to get a

1057
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,920
harvest no it's not going to destroy all

1058
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,019
of your microbes it's not going to

1059
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,700
destroy your fungal colonies and all

1060
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,440
other funny stuff that they decided to

1061
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:01,259
tell you guys none of that is going to

1062
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,240
happen over a few drops of some ph up or

1063
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,339
down it is not the end of the world and

1064
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,078
you guys being like 30 gallons like and

1065
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:09,358
you're worried about a few drops like no

1066
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,700
this is going to make a difference now

1067
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,039
do you incorporate any sugars into your

1068
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,899
garden at all when I feed the ferments

1069
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:18,420
okay so just that you're not doing any

1070
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,338
like some people do molasses no it's in

1071
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,079
the ferment so there there's no point of

1072
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,578
adding it separately if I if I want to

1073
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,440
do a sugar feed and I'll just add some

1074
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,599
of that makes sense so it's kind of one

1075
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
last step yep and the only time I'm

1076
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,320
feeding that anyway is latent flour like

1077
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
there's no other time where the plant is

1078
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,800
going to really need some sugars are you

1079
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,920
adding in any microbial inoculants at

1080
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,380
all imos okay yeah so I'll go and get

1081
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,960
the microbes and stuff myself but do I

1082
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,000
use any specific product no okay so no

1083
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,400
specific product of microbial napkins

1084
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,719
but you're doing IMO the Imo's process

1085
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,820
can you actually break that down for

1086
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,939
those that don't know what IMO is uh

1087
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,619
indigenous microorganisms so outside in

1088
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,300
nature there's plenty of fungal and

1089
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,700
bacterial life if you know how to go and

1090
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,140
find it some people uh they'll sit like

1091
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:02,639
rice out or something and they'll

1092
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:04,679
collect it that way some people will

1093
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,679
take the leaf mulch lift it up find the

1094
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,539
fungal colonies take that I cheat and

1095
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,699
either use a paper bag or cardboard on a

1096
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,199
rainy day I'll let it sit out there and

1097
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,358
then I'll go back later on lift the

1098
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,000
cardboard and it'll just be covered in

1099
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,440
fungi and I'll shred that into pieces

1100
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,579
bring it back up Let the worms go

1101
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,800
through it and everything and it'll

1102
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,119
inoculate the beds themselves

1103
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,039
that's pretty cool I never heard about

1104
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,539
that cardboard technique yeah cheat

1105
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,119
sheet so if you got some dirt just go

1106
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:32,219
out there Lay It Lay It Down Let It Rain

1107
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,780
on top of it or water it yourself when

1108
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,000
you come back in a few days later as

1109
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,800
that box is kind of sort of starting to

1110
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,019
break down you'll lift it up and it'll

1111
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,000
just be covered with fungi on one side

1112
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:46,079
of it enough to try that out I live in

1113
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,699
the desert so I'm like oh yeah dirt out

1114
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,680
here you'll be you'll be surprised which

1115
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,419
you can find yeah I mean it doesn't work

1116
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,819
maybe that'll that'll bring up some of

1117
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,139
those microbes uh and then I'll maybe

1118
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,940
I'll be able to use them in my garden in

1119
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,679
the future because now they're protected

1120
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,240
from the Sun now they have uh something

1121
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,159
they can latch onto and you'll be

1122
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,719
surprised how much of it it is I was

1123
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,759
shocked like when I first seen the

1124
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,439
method done I went and tried it myself

1125
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,320
and then afterwards I looked and I'm

1126
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,119
like yo I think everyone should know

1127
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
about this I even took the dirt layer

1128
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,200
that was underneath it because that was

1129
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,720
fully covered in mycelium afterwards so

1130
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,039
I even took that with me as well that's

1131
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,279
awesome that's really cool that that

1132
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,500
works how about aerated compost teas or

1133
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,079
nutrient teas plant teas manure teas

1134
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,980
anything like that do you do uh I'll do

1135
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,920
a tea

1136
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,280
probably once every couple of rounds

1137
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,720
so I uh main it's mainly just for root

1138
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,460
health is what I'm doing it for it's not

1139
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,259
for readily available nutrients or

1140
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,820
anything it's mainly just for like root

1141
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,000
health so I'll do like stinging nettle

1142
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:48,119
uh maybe a little bit of neem

1143
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,980
um I like and maybe just some worm

1144
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,660
castings or some IMO or something that's

1145
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,179
the that's the most I'm gonna do I try

1146
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,559
to keep it as simple as possible like I

1147
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:57,779
didn't want to take no-till and turn it

1148
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,059
into synthetic growing all over again

1149
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,440
by having to do five six different

1150
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:03,420
things throughout the stage of flower

1151
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,338
like my entire last two rounds was just

1152
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,900
water I didn't even feed them so for the

1153
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:09,239
teas that you do just to dig a little

1154
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:13,740
bit deeper into that how do you brew the

1155
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,299
tea uh I I have like uh you get the mesh

1156
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:16,979
um put everything inside of there and

1157
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,839
Brew it just like everybody else hang it

1158
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,539
off the side of your res and and let it

1159
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,460
Brew for 24 hours sorry what what I

1160
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,679
missed what it actually consists of is

1161
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,380
it consists of worm castings and then

1162
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,779
you said neem in there as well neem yup

1163
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,700
I'll use neem for a root health and it's

1164
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,040
also a good nitrogen Source

1165
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,319
um and stinging nettle because one thing

1166
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,679
you're going to worry about and no-till

1167
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,359
is going to be fungus gnats and a nice

1168
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,739
easy way to get rid of fungus gnats is

1169
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,239
to brew sting and nettle teas because

1170
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,098
they don't like it they can't stand it

1171
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:49,578
so when you water in stinging nettle

1172
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,660
teas into your soil you're kind of

1173
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:53,880
decreasing your chance of having that

1174
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:56,098
fungus night outbreak because it it'll

1175
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,980
it'll destroy them for you so that's the

1176
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,019
most I'll do if if I do it now I'm not

1177
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,820
telling no one to not do it uh please

1178
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:04,440
use all the aerated teas that you want

1179
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,180
to the more the better like I'm not

1180
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,300
going to tell you guys not to do that

1181
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:12,059
but I just don't do it often yeah this

1182
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,680
is just your style of growing right

1183
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:16,139
there are so many different ways to do

1184
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,539
it and that's a good question for the

1185
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:19,858
audience actually tuning in right now if

1186
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,659
you're doing no-till or if you're going

1187
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:23,039
organically in general what way do you

1188
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,659
do it let us know down in the comment

1189
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,519
section below some of your techniques do

1190
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,440
you do the same techniques as Beast

1191
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,358
cross grower here or are you doing your

1192
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,858
own thing a different way to go about it

1193
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:33,299
let us know I love going through the

1194
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:34,559
comment section and reading and just

1195
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,140
seeing the different methods that are

1196
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,519
out there because it's so many and they

1197
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:40,199
poke holes in a lot of your theory

1198
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:41,639
sometimes like sometimes times you'll

1199
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,259
have a way of doing something and

1200
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,400
somebody will be like hey instead of

1201
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,359
that why don't you just try this and

1202
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,660
you're like

1203
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,460
genius yeah genius how did I not how did

1204
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:52,199
I not think of that like how did I not

1205
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,519
see myself running into this problem or

1206
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,679
that problem like you know what you're

1207
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,599
absolutely right thank you so I still

1208
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,879
watch a whole bunch of no-till Growers I

1209
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,500
don't think I know it all I love all of

1210
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,420
the no-till Growers out there Queen of

1211
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,320
the sun grown full of knowledge people

1212
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,940
like that I nerd out on all day IPM I

1213
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,280
want to get into that before we wrap

1214
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,460
things up here I know this wasn't on our

1215
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,260
original list of questions but uh if

1216
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,960
you're comfortable talking about it you

1217
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,060
know one of the common concerns of

1218
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,440
people going to organic so going to

1219
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:25,259
no-till is that they think they're gonna

1220
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,639
have bugs more prone to pests do you do

1221
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,820
anything in particular in order to

1222
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,699
prevent pests the native soil

1223
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,579
so you'll you'll find the area that is

1224
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:37,019
loaded with plants and you will see Mite

1225
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,460
damage on some of those plants you'll

1226
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:40,019
see mildew on some of those plants

1227
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,880
you'll see bugs eating on some of those

1228
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:43,500
plants and then you'll see a section

1229
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,000
that's just pristine

1230
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,739
that lets you know that there are

1231
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,800
predators there and large numbers

1232
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,358
keeping the pests down I want the soil

1233
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,680
from that section that's going to bring

1234
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,420
in all of the predator mites and

1235
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,399
everything else that I need but if need

1236
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,500
be I would also release predator mites

1237
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,420
and that's the the most I would do I try

1238
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,039
to stay away from spraying anything in

1239
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,139
no-till situations and I just haven't

1240
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,639
had no bug problems mainly because I

1241
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:08,759
brought the good bugs to fight the bad

1242
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,618
bugs some people want to fight it with a

1243
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,020
spray bottle I don't have time to be

1244
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,700
doing that but that's a lot of spraying

1245
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:17,099
especially when you got dense canopies

1246
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,659
and you tight spaces you don't want to

1247
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,119
be going in there spraying all the time

1248
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:24,059
so I just make sure that I find areas

1249
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,039
when I bring the native soil that like I

1250
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,199
specifically look for areas heavy in bug

1251
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,818
damage and then I look for an area

1252
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:32,578
that's not heavy and Bug damage that's

1253
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:34,739
nearby and I'll know that this area has

1254
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,420
more Predators than that area apparently

1255
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,459
because you can see the Damage Done to

1256
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,500
one and not done to the other so I want

1257
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,179
the area that has nothing done to it

1258
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,739
that's right next to it

1259
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:45,659
that's the that's the best way I can

1260
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,219
think of it yeah so I know I'm bringing

1261
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,299
a whole bunch of predators and I've seen

1262
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:51,179
them I've looked at them under

1263
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,519
microscopes yeah so there's Predators

1264
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,618
all over the place in my garden and I'm

1265
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,539
perfectly okay with that and I would

1266
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,000
release some too if I didn't have that

1267
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:02,279
that would be my IPM right there is to

1268
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,980
release Predators or use like a jidon

1269
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,440
spray uh maybe use a genome wedding

1270
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,260
agent with maybe like a compost tea or

1271
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,940
something uh they're safer soaps that

1272
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,960
you can use and spend aside and the rest

1273
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,179
of that

1274
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,880
I don't like doing all of that

1275
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:19,440
so so far so good if I run into that

1276
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,260
problem I may wind up using a different

1277
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,940
product but so far so good that makes

1278
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,579
sense so we're getting up towards the

1279
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,260
end of the episode here a couple more

1280
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,260
things I want to ask you actually one of

1281
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,880
them do you have any advice on no-till

1282
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,579
farming that we didn't talk about here

1283
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,960
in this episode or just general advice

1284
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,460
for beginners

1285
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,099
do your best

1286
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,900
to maybe use beds if you can

1287
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,059
um like like the pots do work don't get

1288
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,500
me wrong the pots work amazing but if

1289
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:47,940
you're going to be doing no-tilling this

1290
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,039
soil is not going to be going anywhere

1291
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,599
anyway then just go ahead and use the

1292
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:53,159
beds there's no point in still cleaning

1293
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,960
up your floors in between all of these

1294
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,879
pots and everything when you could just

1295
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,619
have if you got a 4x4 tent they have

1296
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,838
four by four beds you got a five by five

1297
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,180
tent they got five by five beds

1298
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:05,159
um there's really no point in in doing

1299
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:06,779
Pots if you don't have to now if you may

1300
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,000
have to move these plants at some point

1301
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,560
in time you got inspectors coming

1302
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,179
through or people coming by you might

1303
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,119
have to move these one day go ahead and

1304
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,739
use your pots but if not use beds um you

1305
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,420
kind of save yourself from over watering

1306
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,679
it's a little harder to over water at

1307
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,720
that because you're just kind of going

1308
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,759
by Judgment of how much water these beds

1309
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,799
need and they hold a lot too so it's

1310
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,180
kind of hard to over water

1311
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
um and

1312
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:30,539
these plants don't need as much

1313
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,220
nutrients as you're thinking

1314
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,599
that's another word of advice that I'll

1315
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:34,980
give you guys like if you're if you're

1316
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,480
going to do anything close to the method

1317
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,099
that I said where you're amending when

1318
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,500
you make the soil or you're starting

1319
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,940
with a super soil use fresh water and

1320
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,380
maybe have some salt for as long as

1321
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,420
possible

1322
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,858
let let the nutrients run its course

1323
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,940
because you're going to start feeding in

1324
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:49,019
there you're going to get dark green

1325
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,460
leaves you're going to deal with

1326
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:53,099
nitrogen burn you're going to deal with

1327
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,480
all sorts of problems uh if you you go

1328
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,280
ahead and start feeding like you're in a

1329
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,539
synthetic system that nutrient needs to

1330
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,420
run its course

1331
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:02,579
less is more a hundred percent less is

1332
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,680
more like you guys heard I dilute the

1333
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:07,980
ferments three milliliters per gallon

1334
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:09,659
that's not a lot at all that's not a lot

1335
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,460
at all and it but yet it's more than

1336
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,739
enough because we're talking about a

1337
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,318
pure concentrate so at three milliliters

1338
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:19,199
a gallon it's still plenty I have yet to

1339
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,519
venture down the fpgas and ffjs but it's

1340
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,559
on my list of things to do I think

1341
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:24,780
probably next grow is when I'm going to

1342
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,159
try it out for the first time and I'm

1343
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,660
excited because it's something I haven't

1344
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,940
done before you know I've been gardening

1345
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,799
for 12 years now and I haven't done that

1346
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,420
and there's actually still other ways of

1347
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,099
growing that I haven't done and just

1348
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,019
doing these different ways it's just

1349
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,359
been so fun and that's why I encourage

1350
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:40,739
folks listening in just have fun with it

1351
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,358
you know don't try not to get

1352
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,979
overwhelmed with all the different ways

1353
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:46,019
to go about it just

1354
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,338
just try one way and then see what

1355
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:49,259
happens and make adjustments from there

1356
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:51,179
because check back last episode I was in

1357
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,099
one gallon pots of cocoa on tables with

1358
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,739
watering systems and said soil grows too

1359
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:58,559
slow and everything but outdoor I'm a

1360
00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,719
100 no-till grower so I'm like let I

1361
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,179
have an extra room let me just try

1362
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,338
no-till indoor and just see how it is

1363
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:07,318
and I and I'm gonna I'm gonna go with

1364
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:09,779
the stun method sheer total utter

1365
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,920
neglect I'm gonna build these beds the

1366
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,300
way that I'm thinking I'm gonna build

1367
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,220
them and I'm gonna give the plants

1368
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,380
straight water the entire round just to

1369
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,358
see how much nutrients is actually here

1370
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,858
with the entire round and it was

1371
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,259
beautiful converted all the other rooms

1372
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,179
in no-till after and that's just how

1373
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,680
because it was more fun it freed me up

1374
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,899
on more time I don't have to worry about

1375
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,519
no watering systems getting clogged I

1376
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,079
don't have to worry about mixing bottles

1377
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,579
of nutrients and having this and running

1378
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:34,200
out of this I don't have to deal with

1379
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,960
any of that no more now I can actually

1380
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,699
just enjoy growing so do you have

1381
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,639
definitely a big change from last year

1382
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:43,919
we actually recorded that first episode

1383
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:46,019
October of last year so one year ago

1384
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,880
well is when we actually filmed that

1385
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:49,500
episode so I'll definitely have that

1386
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,539
episode linked down in the YouTube

um coming up in the future

1397
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,460
um a lot of organic talk a lot of

1398
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:16,139
regenerative agriculture talk uh a lot

1399
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,240
of ways to show you guys how to be more

1400
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:19,679
sustainable and a game where it's

1401
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,358
forcing you to have to be more

1402
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,980
sustainable like eventually there's

1403
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,900
going to be no way around it that's how

1404
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,760
I got here because it's almost it's

1405
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,380
almost no way around it but to become as

1406
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,119
efficient as possible and I think this

1407
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,220
method is the most efficient method that

1408
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:34,019
there is no-till in some way shape or

1409
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:36,358
form or organic gardening in some way

1410
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:38,219
shape or form to me is going to be more

1411
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,139
viable than any other system that you're

1412
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:42,299
going to be using so a lot of that

1413
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:44,519
coming up and more episodes with the

1414

00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:10,139
had was the scrog technique and you

killed it man so many people love that a

1428

1430
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,039
information as well something completely

1431

different and thanks once again one more

1432
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:22,199
thing yeah go ahead I'm still using that

1433
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,759
exact same scrog method so the same

1434
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:25,679
scrog technique that I was talking about

1435
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,140
using with the one gallon pots of cocoa

1436
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,419
in the water I still use the exact same

1437
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:31,980
scrog method now I transferred that

1438
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,318
right over the only thing that changed

1439
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,300
was the medium that's awesome all right

1440
