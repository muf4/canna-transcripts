1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,759
coming up on garden talk in the flower

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
tent i usually have some type of net

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,160
some type of netting in my flower tents

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,719
so if a plant gets into

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
that tent and it's like really starting

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,518
to get too big i'll kind of bend it over

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,320
using

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,600
that netting my pot sizes when i'm

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
flowering they

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
vary from like i guess the three gallon

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
to a five gallon just depending on

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,919
the strain that's in there i feel like

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,198
i'm that grower that's like

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
borderline i almost break every rule

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,679
possible or try to come as close to it

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,359
you know

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,880
if you get a strain it's great at

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,280
growing in the desert and you bring it

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
to

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
somewhere where it's damp and humid you

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,239
probably gonna mess that strain up

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,398
making everything as simple as possible

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,279
for you because let's face it at the end

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
of the day

25

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,198

30
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,839

like it's been several years

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
since we kind of first found out about

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,479

appreciate your time today yes the

89
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,639
the world has bumped us into each other

90
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,319
once again so

91
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,518
for those that don't know who you are

92
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,399
can you tell us a little bit about

93
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
yourself and

94
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,439
how you got into gardening i'm a small

95
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,839
pretty much home closet grower i guess

96
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,519
for the most part um

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
i pretty much started in nevada like

98
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,158
when

99
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,759
we went recreational out here and it was

100
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,318
kind of legal for me to grow

101
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,679
so to speak i mean when i first started

102
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,359
it was kind of still in the gray

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,280
area-ish

104
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
but um after it went wreck

105
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
or before i went wreck i got my medical

106
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,400
but once it went wreck out here stuff

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
kind of got a little bit more lenient so

108
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,480
i kind of started growing just to i

109
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,760
guess get my feet wet a little bit but

110
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,280
shortly after i started growing i

111
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,919
started reading a little bit more up on

112
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
different

113
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:46,798
strains medicinal strains and

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,040
um kind in hopes to find i guess

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
for my mother like she's got some health

116
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,798
issues and

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,200
at one point in time she was on around

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239
seven or eight different medications

119
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:02,158
and i started making her

120
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,878
um like oil or i would make her edibles

121
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,280
and whatnot

122
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,878
and she would use that and pretty much

123
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,519
alleviate

124
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,000
her she got rid of the majority of the

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
prescriptions that she was taking so

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
it just kind of made me feel good to be

127
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,959
able to produce something

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
you know you could almost say in your

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
own backyard i don't have a backyard

130
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
in my closet in this instance but like

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
you know when you can grow something

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
kind of on-site or produce something on

133
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
site that's

134
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,560
not necessarily chemically altered and

135
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,240
you know i'm not in the science code

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
with the beakers and everything

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,478
sitting up messing with nature so to

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
speak you know

139
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,000
i don't know it just makes me feel good

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
so i've been pretty much

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
in love with it ever since and

142
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,439
here i am now i guess i i wish i had

143
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,359
more space you know one of these days

144
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,360
hopefully i'll get

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,199
be able to kind of i guess expand or

146
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,439
at least upgrade a little bit but

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,080
for my space in area i just kind of make

148
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,199
do with what i have you know

149
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,198

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
channel and check out what he has there

171
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,000
so before we get into the nitty-gritty

172
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
on your grow 10 setup

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,360
and growing in small spaces

174
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,639
you know i really want to first address

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
what you have

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
as your primary goals right so everybody

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,959
has their goals before they grow

178
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,478
if you talk to me eight to 10 years ago

179
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,959
i would have told you my primary goal

180
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,359
was to

181
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,799
obtain as high of a yield as possible

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
that's not everybody's goal right i

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,919
think some people jump to the assumption

184
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,638
that everybody's goal is a high yield

185
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,959
that's not really

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
the case for everybody these days i'm

187
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,318
focused mostly on simplicity

188
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
how do i make things easier in the

189
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,000
garden and i've also been focusing on

190
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,879
efficiency so reducing that electrical

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
consumption

192
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,560
what would you say your goals are what

193
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
are your primary goals

194
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
for your garden when i first started off

195
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
i was kind of like you i think i wanted

196
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,359
that

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
i was just pushing for uh

198
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,519
two things i think i wanted to save

199
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,439
myself some money you know as far i

200
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,799
wouldn't have to go out and buy that bag

201
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,279
as much you know so to speak or

202
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,960
that my main goal is just i guess you

203
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,758
you know to try to get as much as i

204
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,598
could

205
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,439
and um over the years i've

206
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,680
kind of strayed away from that for the

207
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,839
most part especially

208
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,038
trying to work more with like medicinal

209
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,719
strains and trying to

210
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,439
kind of zone in on the strength of my

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,000
mother it's been more just like

212
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,000
quality for me for the most part um

213
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
viewed i mean yield is good but if you

214
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,280
have a pound of something it's like

215
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,159
compared to you know a half a pound or a

216
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,439
quarter pound

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,759
of something that's a1 or you know top

218
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,759
notch

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,160
and i guess it's all up to the person at

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,439
the end of the day you know but

221
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,479
overall now my my

222
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,399
my overall i guess expectation out of

223
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,959
the garden is just like my

224
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,478
quality for the most part and to make

225
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,680
sure everything you know kind of just

226
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,240
runs smoothly um

227
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
fortunately like i started growing

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,120
around the led era

229
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,759
so i i didn't have to go through the hps

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,079
and the

231
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
hid and all these extra other lights

232
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,719
that you know the old school growers

233
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,680
went through kind of

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,240
with them higher electricity bills and

235
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
honestly

236
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,759
i haven't like grown with leds for the

237
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,359
most part i really haven't seen like a

238
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,759
super

239
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:21,520
jump in my electricity bill in general

240
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,840
um but as i said

241
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,839
you know i don't run a huge goal either

242
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,839
so to speak

243
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,598
so you know if if

244
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,119
i guess it got to the point to where my

245
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,319
electricity was kind of getting out of

246
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
hand you know i would

247
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
kind of keep that in mind that hey i

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
need to kind of

249
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,359
make this as efficient as possible

250
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,919
because

251
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,278
ironically as the times are going on and

252
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:47,679
you know as more places legalized like

253
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,639
the cost of stuff is going down a lot

254
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,519
and you know in some instances it almost

255
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,600
might be easier for and i'm not trying

256
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,959
to discourage anybody from growing but

257
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,000
if you're paying more in electricity

258
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,759
and you know items for your grow and

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,958
more to keep up with it then it would

260
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,600
cost you to go

261
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,518
to your local produce market or

262
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,200
dispensary or whatever

263
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
you know it kind of defeats the purpose

264
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
unless you're doing it

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,080
with a specific purpose you know such as

266
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,839
breeding or

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
you just want variety of something that

268
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
you can't get you know where you're at

269
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
at the

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,720
moment in time but i i don't know i i

271
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,958
feel like for the most part

272
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
i i like to concentrate on the quality

273
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,439
of the product you know especially

274
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
working

275
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
with strange trying to help ease my

276
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,399
mom's

277
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,080
ailments and whatnot you know i just

278
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,440
want her to have the best

279
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
it's like i'm trying to get her the name

280
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
brand i don't want to get her to generic

281
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,759
that works i want to get her you know

282
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,799
make the best

283
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,519
brand possible for the most part so

284
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,519
gotcha and yeah just to piggyback off of

285
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,679
the whole efficiency thing i mean if you

286
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
have a small grow i mean that's you're

287
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,120
not going to really worry much about

288
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
it as long as you you're running the

289
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,039
appropriate

290
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,200
equipment within there so kind of to get

291
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,799
into your growth setup you know we'll

292
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
get into the topic today which is indoor

293
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,240
gardening and

294
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,838
a small grow tent or really any small

295
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
spaces i guess you could say this

296
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
can apply to so let's talk about your

297
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
current growth setup

298
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
i know you grow in a smaller tent can

299
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,799
you tell me a little bit about your

300
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,200
setup

301
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,879
like what size growth space lighting

302
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
equipment you have in there so on and so

303
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,439
forth

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,600
well currently i i have a

305
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,760
two by two by two just like a square

306
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,320
or a cube cube for the most part um

307
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,360
i use that for my germinating and maybe

308
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,560
keeping like

309
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,800
starting seeds or keeping cuts around

310
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,399
for the most part you know sometimes

311
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,078
i have the problem of overgrowing

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
because

313
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,359
of my space being so confined like a lot

314
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
of times

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,720
especially some of my keepers

316
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,399
my mom's training in particular likes to

317
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
grow and if i don't

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,559
keep that thing trimmed it's just like

319
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
you should try to grow out of the tent

320
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,958
you know and there's not a lot of space

321
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,919
in most two by twos to grow multiple

322
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,799
plants you know

323
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,838
i mean it's it's advised to grow like

324
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,838
one to two plants

325
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
two is kind of pushing it in a two by

326
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
two like one plant

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
will give you probably the best yield as

328
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,599
long as you

329
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,839
you know kind of scrog it out or make

330
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,759
your canopy

331
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,839
nice and even as even as possible you

332
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,559
know but

333
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,040
my two by two by two is a my germination

334
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,639
tent

335
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:42,799
and i'm running just regular

336
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:46,078
i think it's a four bay like it was a t5

337
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:49,679
setup or t3 something like that but

338
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,679
i found some led bulbs for it so

339
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,120
that's kind of reducing the electricity

340
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,399
usage of the light i really haven't

341
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,879
noticed any

342
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,200
i guess yield difference in that

343
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,679
specific tent but we are talking about a

344
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
small

345
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,919
like a small area and you know the

346
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,480
lights not the

347
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,958
i forget how many watts my my little

348
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
four bay uh

349
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,638
light thing is but i've had it for the

350
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,680
longest so um

351
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,278
you know if it's not broke don't fix it

352
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,879
but outside of that um in my closet i

353
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:25,278
have two

354
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,879
two by two by i think they're

355
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,320
they're not quite six feet because i'm

356
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,240
taller than the tents

357
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
so they might be like five and a half or

358
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,278
five nine something like that

359
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,720
and i use one for germinating

360
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,519
and one for i'm not germinating

361
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,079
one for veg the others for flower and i

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,600
just kind of rotate you know

363
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,319
i i attempt to keep a perpetual girl

364
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,240
going

365
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
as as much as i can every once in a

366
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,680
while something will happen and

367
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,159
you know i might have to restart or

368
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,599
whatever you know but for the most part

369
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,879
i try to keep that

370
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,159
there's always something in a

371
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,360
germination tent there's always

372
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,399
something in beds there's always

373
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,399
something in flower

374
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,440
you know but my my primary goal is to

375
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,480
get it to where like

376
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,040
i could harvest once every other month

377
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,720
but i just it's like i have the schedule

378
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,559
and i know what to do

379
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
it just never works out for me because

380
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,759
it's kind of dependent on the strangest

381
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,759
themselves and how far along the cuts

382
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,439
are and everything and it's it's

383
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,958
it's kind of weird but like i said i

384
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,079
keep something in each one of those and

385
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,078
as far as lighting goes

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,160
i've been approached by a few different

387
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,919
lighting companies to you know review

388
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,120
lights and this and that and

389
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,719
i think in the veg tent right now

390
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,399
i'm running to mars want to say ts 600

391
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
or something of that nature

392
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,078
and then in my flower tent and i got the

393
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,959
viper specter

394
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,159
so they're probably if they see that

395
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,799
they're probably mad he can't

396
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,600
tell the name of our like i'm sorry i

397
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,198
just

398
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,278
i don't have it written down right now

399
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,958
but i do have videos for them on my

400
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,799
channel so you know anytime i get a

401
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,239
new light or something i'll do a

402
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,639
unboxing or a review

403
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
and if i have a promo code or anything

404
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,360
like that you know i'll put it all in

405
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,399
the description of my video

406
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,440
so i think both of my flower lights are

407
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,639
considered 1000 watt leds or whatever

408
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,120
so they're not the highest end

409
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
you know but they're not like the lowest

410
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
and so my yields are

411
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,199
fairly decent but then again i'm not

412
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,278
i'm not really trying to push that pound

413
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:37,039
to plant envelope you know i'm more

414
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:39,519
like i said earlier i want that the

415
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,958
quality i just want to clarify that when

416
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,560
you say a thousand watts you're talking

417
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,799
about the equivalent

418
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,559
yeah of a thousand watt hps so really

419
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,559
it's around 100 watts is

420
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,000
true wattage for some of these lights

421
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,838
some of these chinese manufacturers

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,679
they'll say a thousand watt

423
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
uh in the title but it'd actually be a

424
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,120
thousand one equivalent

425
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,879
so there's a lot of controversy behind

426
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,159
all that so

427
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,159
yeah but as far as

428
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,600
you know in a two foot by two foot grow

429
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,319
tent when you're flowering in there you

430
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
mentioned that

431
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
one plant sometimes two plants you think

432
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,319
sometimes two plants

433
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,799
is pushing it now when you have two

434
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,040
plants in there what size grow

435
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,639
pot do you typically use and what type

436
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,679
do you use the plastic

437
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
fabric idealistically i would like to

438
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,000
keep one plant in my flower tent but i

439
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,519
can't

440
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
like just because of the fact that i

441
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,839
like varieties and

442
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,278
it's a must that i keep at least one of

443
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
my mom's

444
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,078
plants and flower pretty much at all

445
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,919
times so i can kind of keep up with her

446
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,519
you know that i don't want to call it

447
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,639
medicine but her

448
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,639
herbal supplement so to speak you know

449
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,919
and um then i push the envelope with my

450
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,839
two by twos like i

451
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:55,198
depending on pot size a lot of times

452
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,480
i put anywhere from one to

453
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,599
maybe four plants in my 2x2 and i can

454
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
fit

455
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
four or five gallon pots you know one in

456
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,879
each corner

457
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
if it's is it the best decision i'm not

458
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,838
gonna you know i'm not telling you to do

459
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
this at home kids

460
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
this is just something that works for me

461
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
you know

462
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,919
and i know that it could be better if i

463
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
put that one plan in there

464
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,958
you know my yield might be a little bit

465
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
better

466
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,599
but to me it's just like i said i'm a

467
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
stickler for variety i want to

468
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,680
have some flavors you know i kind of get

469
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,639
tired of

470
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,319
using the same thing over and over again

471
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,240
i don't know if they call it burnt out

472
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,160
or whatever i just

473
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
i don't know i like a little bit of

474
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,679
variety you know that's

475
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
one of the reasons you go to the beer

476
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,758
island that's a million beers right

477
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
there like if we all just wanted one

478
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,039
type of beer in the world then there

479
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
would just be one beer but there's not

480
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,719
there's a variety

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,958
and i like variety so i like to keep a

482
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,519
couple different plants in there but

483
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,799
my pot sizes when i'm flowering they

484
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,480
vary from like

485
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,159
i guess the three gallons to a five

486
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
gallon just depending on

487
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,759
the strain that's in there some of my

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
strengths my mom's constraints the

489
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,679
heavier feeders so i usually keep that

490
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,798
in a five gallon

491
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
and you know some of the other strains

492
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,838
that i know

493
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,119
aren't as heavy feeders i might get away

494
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:22,078
with putting a three gallon in there and

495
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,798
i've had at a time three five gallons

496
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,279
and then two

497
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,639
three gallons in in my plant in my tent

498
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,519
so

499
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,440
it's like i'm a bad landlord that just

500
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,440
likes to pack

501
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960
i need as many tenants in my garden as i

502
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
can get you know

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,600
do you do uh plastic pots or

504
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
fabric pots air pots and then are you in

505
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,119
soil

506
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,199
or cocoa or what been in soil

507
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,279
pretty much since i started um i've

508
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
tried coco running coco straight i've

509
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,119
tried running

510
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you know like different mixtures i ran

511
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,918
organic

512
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,960
like i made a super soil

513
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,880
about two years ago i um

514
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,880
i forget the name of the book but

515
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,320
i think his name is the rev or something

516
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,160
like that

517
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,798
um yeah true living organics by the rev

518
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,558
yeah i i picked that book up a while

519
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,480
back and made one of the

520
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,399
super soils or whatever you want to call

521
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,798
it from in there and

522
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
in all honesty i just watered that

523
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,558
specific

524
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,519
girl and that was probably some of the

525
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,839
best

526
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:34,160
quality that i've ever had and

527
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,918
the batch of soil that i made like it

528
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
kind of cost me a little pretty penny to

529
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
get that

530
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,240
batch together so at the time

531
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,839
you know i had a lot of synthetic

532
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,359
nutrients you know i've had a couple

533
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,319
people

534
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,839
every time i go to the the hydro store

535
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,000
out here you know they're always pawning

536
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,000
stuff off on you here try this or this

537
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,279
you know giving you samples and

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,079
i know i ran general hydro brands

539
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,399
sweet leafs products were like i think

540
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,639
those are supposed to be on the organic

541
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
they're not 100 organic but it's kind of

542
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
an

543
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
organic based synthetic nutrient mine if

544
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,519
there is such a thing i mean there are

545
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,000
people that kind of argue up and down

546
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,119
with that nature but i pretty much tried

547
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,359
it all

548
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,759
you know just to kind of get the

549
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,240
experience with different

550
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,038
nutrients and different mediums and in

551
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,679
general um i've always kind of tried to

552
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,720
want to go

553
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,480
uh do a hydro girl but unfortunately i'm

554
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,600
in an apartment on the second floor

555
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,839
and i'm super paranoid about leaks and

556
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,439
stuff going downstairs like if i was

557
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,199
downstairs it'd probably be different

558
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
but

559
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,000
i don't want to go through all that so

560
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,079
until i you know either move into a

561
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,759
single level area where i could kind of

562
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,359
try that out you know it's just been

563
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,440
pretty much cocoa

564
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,119
or some type of fox farm soil or

565
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
local soil from the home depot or

566
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,000
whatever whatever i can kind of get my

567
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
hands on and

568
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,880
after a while i tried to well not try to

569
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,759
i try to recycle as much as my soil

570
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,039
as i can as well like i try to clean out

571
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,720
you know any root

572
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,480
matter or whatever and um

573
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,558
when i first started doing it i wasn't

574
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,279
flushing it so to speak so there was a

575
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:20,558
lot of build up in my soil from like

576
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,119
you know past girls or whatever and

577
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,158
i learned the hard way you know i ate up

578
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,918
some plants just

579
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,760
burnt you know burnt them by over

580
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,320
feeding them because i was feeding them

581
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,158
on top of whatever was in the soil so

582
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,759
you know i learned a lot of diff just

583
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,360
different do's and don'ts

584
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,798
over the years because

585
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,399
it doesn't matter how many books you

586
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,240
read at the end of the day on the

587
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
subject matter until you get your hands

588
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
in that dirt

589
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,798
or that water or on the plants itself

590
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,080
like

591
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,639
there's nothing like the actual

592
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,759
experience itself so

593
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,640
um but you mentioned pots too like i've

594
00:20:53,759 --> 00:21:00,720
had fabric pots i've ran

595
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,360
i guess like netted pots um plastic pots

596
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,120
air i think they're air pots it's pretty

597
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,038
much just been trial and error with me

598
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:11,519
i like i guess if i had my choice i love

599
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,599
fabric pots but cleaning those things

600
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,359
you know especially if you're not

601
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,199
if you don't catch those like right

602
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,479
before they start to kind of grow

603
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
they're not supposed to grow through the

604
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,759
pot so to speak you know they're

605
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,559
supposed to kind of air prune

606
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,279
roots wise but they don't always happen

607
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,038
sometimes

608
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:32,158
you know i've had those pots kind of

609
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,200
when i um feed from the bottom or just

610
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,360
water like

611
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
my catch tray and let the fabric pot

612
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,879
soak up the water

613
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
there's been instances where i've had a

614
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,080
little bit too much water in the trailer

615
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,679
that you know a little bit of water sit

616
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,000
in the bottom and like the roots will

617
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,320
start kind of growing through the pot

618
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
like throughout the tray into the water

619
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,439
or whatever

620
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
so it does help with air pruning a

621
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
little bit but it doesn't like alleviate

622
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,079
the problem

623
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,519
you know and getting that plant out of

624
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,720
there was like a pain in the butt

625
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,599
because i ended up

626
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,360
kind of pruning the roots myself pulling

627
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,399
it away from the pot or whatever you

628
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,158
know

629
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,919
but i've tried to use it all man

630
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,760
if it's out there i want to use it see

631
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,520
it you know try it whether i stick with

632
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,480
it or not that's a whole other thing but

633
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,480
you know

634
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
at least i can say yeah i've tried that

635
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,599
product or

636
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,880
i've tried that method i've attempted

637
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,240
that you know

638
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,480
i've tried the like the plastic bags

639
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
from

640
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,840
they're okay but i've always had to put

641
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,599
like more holes in them because

642
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,158
once you feel them and they sit right

643
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,759
it's like there's not the drainage isn't

644
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
proper so

645
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,079
i don't know if they thought about that

646
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,439
i mean i'm sure somebody has but i don't

647
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,480
know maybe i should come out with my own

648
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,600
grow bags with enough

649
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,960
hoes there you go to drain properly like

650
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,240
i don't know innovation for sure so

651
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,319
when you're growing in these small

652
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,798
spaces right they small or

653
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,879
grow tents are you mostly growing

654
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:04,240
autoflowers or photoperiod

655
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,360
i think i've grown one autoflower in the

656
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
six

657
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,719
or whatever five six years that i've

658
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,319
been growing um

659
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,679
i wasn't too pleased with the yield

660
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,439
in general and to me

661
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
i like the photo period there's

662
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,759
something about that hunt

663
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,279
like you know popping seeds

664
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,879
growing the plant for a little while

665
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,558
trying to figure out hey is this boy is

666
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
this a girl you know like playing the

667
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,759
guessing game it's kind of like being

668
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
pregnant

669
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,798
so to speak you know not knowing if it

670
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,080
is it a boy is it a girl like

671
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,480
you know and then that kind of moment of

672
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,759
truth

673
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,240
after you flower you know start to

674
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,798
flower the plant out to sea or or sex

675
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,839
the plant

676
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,359
so to speak you know and that moment of

677
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,359
truth when you actually see it's like

678
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,558
getting your ultrasound what's a boy or

679
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,000
it's a girl you know you

680
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,240
you see those those female hairs or the

681
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
the the male sacks coming off the plant

682
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
you know it's

683
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,038
i don't know there's just something

684
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
about that that has a little bit more

685
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,359
allure to me

686
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,759
than just yeah this is going to be a

687
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,879
female it's going to be this strain and

688
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,640
you know that's that but

689
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,120
that's not to say that i won't ever grow

690
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,679
them again i just i'm having too

691
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,599
much fun along my journey right now with

692
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,960
i guess photo period you know

693
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,519
plants to even get to that point and

694
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,200
on my journey i've made a couple i think

695
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,119
i've made like 10 crosses

696
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
i haven't stabilized anything you know

697
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,798
i'm not a

698
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,520
quote-unquote breeder as much as i

699
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,759
aspire to be one like it takes time to

700
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,119
kind of get there you know but i've had

701
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,200
people ask me about

702
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,959
some of the crosses that i made like you

703
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,519
ever think about feminizing those or

704
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,278
making autos and

705
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,679
i'm not at that point yeah i get what

706
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,079
you mean you know 10 15 years ago

707
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,159
these autoflowers the genetics they

708
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,879
stayed pretty small so some may

709
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,720
say hey that's good for small spaces

710
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
these days i mean i've had some autos

711
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
that blew up

712
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
like crazy like four feet five feet

713
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,400
easily so

714
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,440
um i hear a lot of people saying that

715
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,120
autoflowers

716
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,038
are good for small spaces i don't know

717
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,839
if i would necessarily agree with that

718
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,599
photo period you get that control to

719
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,119
where you can keep it small

720
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,959
via training which we'll talk about in a

721
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,158
little bit and then you're able to

722
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
change that light cycle and flip the

723
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,760
flower

724
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,519
to force flowering versus the autoflower

725
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,359
could blow up in the first 30 days all

726
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,558
of a sudden you've got height issues

727
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,959
and you've got another three weeks of

728
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,879
stretch on top of that so it could be

729
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,159
it could get out of hand pretty crazy

730
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
but um yeah

731
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,720
it comes down to a preference thing i

732
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:43,599
feel like but going into

733
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
transplanting i want to talk about that

734
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,079
you mentioned

735
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
you're in three to five gallon

736
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,720
containers typically right is your final

737
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,278
container

738
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,798
i've seen your videos you typically

739
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:53,278
start out correct me from wrong you

740
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,278
typically

741
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,640
will start out in a smaller like solo

742
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,240
cup for example

743
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
and then i believe you transplant up do

744
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,400
you go directly into that three

745
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
or five gallon container or are you

746
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
going to a one gallon container

747
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,520
and then your final container and then

748
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
when do you typically do that

749
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,798
transplanting

750
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,320
well for the most part if it's a season

751
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,960
i'm not going

752
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,678
to be sure of the six of the plant i

753
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,038
usually go to

754
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,960
like a one gallon or i've been known to

755
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,400
go to like a half gallon just depending

756
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,278
on what i started out at

757
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,759
i've started out seeds like in like a

758
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,159
clone

759
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,158
tray for the most part like i feel the

760
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
cone tray

761
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,000
or i guess they might be propagation

762
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,158
trays i don't know what they're called

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,240
i'd fill those up with you know soil or

764
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,919
some type of median and just put seeds

765
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,919
in there and then kind of

766
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,759
with that being so small i can go into a

767
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,679
solo cup after that and then maybe like

768
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,919
a half gallon

769
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
and then a one gallon or whatever if

770
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,200
it's a

771
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,558
a clone or something and i know it's a

772
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
female or whatever i

773
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,798
sometimes i'll go from once it gets

774
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,480
rooted into the biggest pot

775
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,639
you know or sometimes i'll go to that

776
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,200
one it really just depends on the space

777
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
in my garden like this space

778
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,038
and what's moving around where it really

779
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,159
depicts on

780
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,558
depicts what i kind of put stuff in you

781
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,440
know for the most part because

782
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,079
i used to keep like a five gallon pot in

783
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
my veg

784
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:24,720
tent as a mother plant for my mom strain

785
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,558
and i ended up

786
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,480
like cloning the mess out of that plant

787
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,158
because she was getting like way too big

788
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
for the tent

789
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
and i ended up dropping that down to two

790
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
and a half gallon but now it's like i

791
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,239
have to

792
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,960
almost clone her twice as often because

793
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,519
ironically enough it's like i almost

794
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,600
feel like

795
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,879
she's growing faster now in a smaller

796
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,319
area

797
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,000
and she's a lot more like susceptible

798
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:55,278
to stuff going wrong like her drying out

799
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,720
or being over under nutrient being over

800
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,000
under fed so that five gallon pot to me

801
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
is like the sweet spot but

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
it affects my space in there so it

803
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
really just depends on

804
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,759
the strains that i'm running and you

805
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,079
know the amount of space that i have in

806
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,879
there

807
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,398
kinda i told you i'm that mean landlord

808
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
i'm trying to stick everybody in there

809
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,239
like sardines and

810
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,360
i know it affects my growth especially

811
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,720
with some of the

812
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,879
i guess circulation you know sometimes

813
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
a lot sometimes i'll get that overlap

814
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,919
where your leaves are

815
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,399
you know this plant might be kind of

816
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,159
overlapping the plant next to it

817
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:34,000
and as much as i don't want it to affect

818
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,840
that grow like your plants need as much

819
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,038
energy as they can from that light

820
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,639
with me running leds you know it's

821
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,319
i'm just kind of pushing it i kind of

822
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,440
like to push the envelope a little bit

823
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,918
more but

824
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,440
i know that like i said if i put one

825
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
plant in there i can get a bigger yield

826
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,880
off of it but i just try to keep as much

827
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,798
in there as i can so i can get you know

828
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
just kind of keep all my bases covered

829
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,079
but i think i went

830
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,960
i ran a seven gallon fabric pot one time

831
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,678
i think in my tent or it wasn't

832
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,519
something here it was a

833
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,960
ten i was doing offsite for one of my

834
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,759
partners

835
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,038
and i really didn't see any difference

836
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:23,359
yield wise or like size wise from

837
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:26,960
running the same plant and a five gallon

838
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,599
but i really didn't do a scientific i

839
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,720
didn't measure

840
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,319
both fields and you know what was being

841
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,480
fed and the lighting there's two

842
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,119
different lights so

843
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,599
it's possible that the bigger median

844
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,719
area

845
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,079
gave off a bigger yield you know but i

846
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,839
don't know i really don't see a big

847
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,639
difference between

848
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,278
the yield and like i guess when i did

849
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,840
that five

850
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,519
down and the seven gallon but i noticed

851
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,359
when i do

852
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,440
when i flower out like either two and a

853
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,278
half or three gallon or five gallon like

854
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,440
there's a big

855
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:05,599
difference in the beer you know so

856
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,278
like i said i just i want to try it all

857
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,278
but i think that's my sweet spot for the

858
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,880
most part is like flour i like to keep

859
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,640
something you know i flower out in a

860
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,159
five gallon

861
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,720
um veg is anywhere from a half gallon to

862
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,240
maybe a two and a half gallon pot

863
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,120
and then in germination you know

864
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,319
i think i have like some little pint

865
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,798
sized

866
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,119
pots that like you get when you go home

867
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,759
depot and buy your little starter

868
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,359
seedlings or whatever i got a bunch of

869
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,240
those off the show that i did a long

870
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,639
time ago

871
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,399
that some folks were getting rid of so i

872
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,240
kind of left up on that but

873
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,319
i'm almost like you whatever's around

874
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,679
because i've had you know i've tried so

875
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,359
much to everything it's

876
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,240
sometimes i look in my tent there's a

877
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,398
fabric pot of five gallon home depots

878
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,679
you know paint bucket that i put holes

879
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,519
in and

880
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
a couple plastic bags and this and that

881
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,038
and it's like man you have the

882
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,440
just to throw two garden over here but

883
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,038
it works you know and at the end of the

884
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,519
day i think that's all you can do is do

885
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,798
what works best for you you know

886
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,359
so going back to plant training

887
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,639
you know when you're in small spaces you

888
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,879
have height restrictions

889
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,240
you have space restrictions just in

890
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
general what do you

891
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,839
typically do for plant training in order

892
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,960
to keep those plants

893
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,798
you know small within that growth space

894
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,480
usually in the germination stage i

895
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,200
really don't do too much to them i mean

896
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,679
as their

897
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
seedlings their small cuttings i i

898
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,080
really don't

899
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:38,879
do too much to them um sometimes if it's

900
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,079
if i do have a seedling and to me i feel

901
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,440
it's growing a little bit too

902
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,639
fast i might like crop it or super crop

903
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
it whatever

904
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,000
cut the top nodes off once it gets past

905
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
like its

906
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,599
fifth set of leaves or whatever and um

907
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,119
i'll let it sit maybe the germination

908
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,000
for probably about another week before i

909
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,798
put in

910
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,119
the veg tent and in the veg tent i mean

911
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,398
i've

912
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,199
used anything from um what they call it

913
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,000
garden tape

914
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,640
like the green garden tape and kind of

915
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
you know

916
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,519
loosely taped around limbs and kind of

917
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,679
bent them down and taped it to the pot

918
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,200
you know if i'm using a plastic pot in

919
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,720
that instance um

920
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
i've used string and in the past to kind

921
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,679
of tie

922
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,880
you know branches down to kind of slow

923
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,000
them from growth

924
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,320
growing as high as fast and promoting i

925
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
guess a bushier canopy as well

926
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,839
and the flower tent i usually have some

927
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,839
type of net

928
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,519
some type of netting in my flower tent

929
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,240
so if i need

930
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,960
if a plant gets into that tent and it's

931
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,640
like

932
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,480
really starting to get too big i'll kind

933
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,519
of bend it over using

934
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,120
that netting um

935
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,839
i also use the netting for kind of

936
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,439
spacing and trying to just get my

937
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:55,119
i guess get every

938
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,720
piece of the plant just kind of spread

939
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,639
out so it gets that

940
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
as even as amount of lighting as

941
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
possible a lot of times like when you

942
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
grow from seed

943
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,880
you have that uniform kind of christmas

944
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,360
tree structure with the plant

945
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,960
and that assuming you don't top it or

946
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,759
anything like that you know if you do

947
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
top it

948
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,038
and and kind of train it a little bit

949
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,839
more i guess you can spread that canopy

950
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,679
out but

951
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,439
sometimes from seed i like to just let

952
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,759
it grow like that first run

953
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,840
i just let it grow to see i guess some

954
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,119
of the plants

955
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,158
[Music]

956
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,918
you know the the node spacing and how i

957
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,080
guess fast it grows

958
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,440
and in that case the the net really

959
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,759
comes in handy because i can kind of

960
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,759
spread

961
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,199
i guess the the branches and the arms of

962
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,240
the

963
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,558
you're playing out but when you

964
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,798
you know do other training methods as

965
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,278
far as i guess super cropping and low

966
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,038
stress training and whatnot it just

967
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,038
the netting in there in my flower tent

968
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,079
it helps i guess keep everything at bay

969
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,119
as well as

970
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,599
keep your your canopy even you know

971
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,918
and with some of the strains i grew a

972
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:08,078
lemon tree strain out not too long ago

973
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,480
and it was like super spindly almost

974
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,320
it wasn't a very i guess bulky type of

975
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,838
strain it was kind of dainty on the

976
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
dainty side i don't know if it was just

977
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,679
that specific

978
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,759
um cut or whatever but

979
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,240
in that case it's almost like i needed

980
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,560
the the netting to kind of hold the

981
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,838
plant up once it got so big

982
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,440
because the branches were like smaller

983
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:35,599
than my pinky just

984
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,559
small branches super thin almost wispy

985
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,519
like

986
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,239
it was crazy the flower was decent but

987
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,918
it

988
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,838
the plant structure and everything to me

989
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,559
it just wasn't something that

990
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,000
i would keep you know in my garden for

991
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,078
the most part especially if

992
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,878
i was to try to take it outside i think

993
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,960
that thing would probably

994
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,799
fly away it looked like a tumbleweed you

995
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,599
know

996
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,599
crossing the road or something out here

997
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,559
i hear you and what you said about the

998
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
um

999
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,000
topping and then low stress training

1000
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,559
from there that's what i typically do

1001
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
now

1002
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,759
especially when i'm trying to stay in a

1003
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,039
smaller area

1004
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
i've tried so many different training

1005
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,960
methods over the years just about

1006
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,039
everything you know topping filming

1007
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,079
super cropping so on and so forth but

1008
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,320
you know when i'm trying to keep it

1009
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,440
small in small spaces i will do that

1010
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,559
topping

1011
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,639
typically i'll let it grow up to like

1012
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,838
the fifth node the third node fourth

1013
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,759
node fifth node

1014
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,199
then i'll top the plant sometimes

1015
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,160
depending on growth if it has real long

1016
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,239
inner nodes

1017
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,759
i'll take it from the fifth node top it

1018
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,879
down to the third node

1019
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
you know what it means i will remove

1020
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,838
some of that growth then from there i'll

1021
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,119
allow it to grow

1022
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,759
and i'll bend down those branches

1023
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,119
to make sure keep it small even canopy

1024
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,560
like you mentioned

1025
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,240
i like how you mentioned the netting in

1026
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,880
there as well that definitely

1027
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,159
would help in a small space you know

1028
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
bending those branches down in the

1029
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,319
netting

1030
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,000
and then super cropping what i

1031
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,800
personally like to do is even when using

1032
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
the netting

1033
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,560
sometimes some shoots will grow up

1034
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,920
taller than others saw a super crop in

1035
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,119
and that's usually when i'm

1036
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,320
in that um that stretch period right so

1037
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,640
i flipped a flower

1038
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,160
now things are growing up in the netting

1039
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,679
some growing more than the others so

1040
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,118
within the first like two weeks or so

1041
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,919
three weeks or so i'll do some super

1042
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,000
cropping

1043
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,960
that's typically what i'll do in smaller

1044
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,039
spaces

1045
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,199
in order to try to you know keep things

1046
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,000
small all right let's get into

1047
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,159
uh nutrients let's get into water what

1048
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,838
do you typically use for base nutrients

1049
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,358
and then what type of water do you use

1050
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,159
do you use filtered water

1051
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,679
tap water well water distilled water

1052
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,519
that's another thing i

1053
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,519
i could say i've almost tried it all

1054
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,440
i started out with tap water from my

1055
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,880
sink like

1056
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,280
before i as a novice i mean a complete

1057
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,200
novice from back in the day

1058
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,800
um i was just running tap water you know

1059
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,039
i was one of those guys oh you just need

1060
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,400
to water it you know

1061
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,480
and then i had to sit down and kind of

1062
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,519
learn this trade

1063
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,280
you know via youtube and books and other

1064
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,358
social media platforms and a couple

1065
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,599
friends or whatnot but

1066
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,119
a lot of it was was trial and error just

1067
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
getting

1068
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,680
kind of doing it you know getting your

1069
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,838
hands in that dirt so to speak

1070
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:18,559
and um well from tap water

1071
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,000
uh i bought a ph pen and a tds meter or

1072
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,358
whatever

1073
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
and i think the first time i took the

1074
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,598
readings on

1075
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,359
like my local tap water or whatever um

1076
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,720
i want to say my tap water came out at

1077
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,880
like 420

1078
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,199
410 parts per million or something like

1079
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,680
that i couldn't tell you what the ph was

1080
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,519
on it

1081
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,358
you know at the time or whatever but

1082
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:43,280
once i figured that out

1083
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:46,400
i went and i got the amazon i bought a

1084
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,880
ro filter off amazon and i was running

1085
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,639
that

1086
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,680
for a while you know so i could get that

1087
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:57,039
zero parts per million neutral water

1088
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,759
in order to add my synthetic ingredients

1089
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,239
because

1090
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
when i first started off i was overfleet

1091
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,559
i was over feeding my plants and i

1092
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,358
didn't know it

1093
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,239
like when i started i was using general

1094
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,960
hydro

1095
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,879
and they have like a feeding chart that

1096
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,639
you can download offline

1097
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,559
it might be on some of their products as

1098
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,759
well but i i ended up downloading it

1099
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,838
offline and

1100
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,839
being new i kind of wanted to get the

1101
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,000
best you know i wanted the best so to

1102
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,279
speak and the guy

1103
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,358
at the hydroponic store you know saw him

1104
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,839
a young guppy fish and reeled me

1105
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,639
in and i ended up buying like the

1106
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,078
advanced

1107
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:36,879
news chance products which is like

1108
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,039
and it's our like in the top of each

1109
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,160
week it gives you

1110
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,000
like a ppm number of

1111
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,879
once you mix the ingredient the

1112
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,400
nutrients like your ppm should be around

1113
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,880
whatever level like 800 or 400 or

1114
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,000
whatever and when i was starting off

1115
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,480
with 420

1116
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,239
tap water and then adding however you

1117
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,320
know many parts per million

1118
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,598
depending on what week it was like i

1119
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,920
would always be at least at 420

1120
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,440
parts per million over so i was way over

1121
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,720
feeding my plants in the beginning you

1122
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,838
know

1123
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,319
and then i got the ro filter but

1124
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,759
after using that for probably i don't

1125
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,039
know i want to say i use that about a

1126
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,079
year

1127
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,480
and then one of my buddies that pointed

1128
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,079
out to me was like man you ever

1129
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
you know notice how much water that

1130
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,920
thing wastes

1131
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,680
and i didn't and i was i ended up

1132
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,800
hooking the runoff

1133
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,239
you know of the ro filter

1134
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,599
well i didn't hook it up into anything

1135
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,598
there's a hose that comes off but i

1136
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,119
ended up draining that into

1137
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,359
like a a container and i kept like

1138
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,039
measuring that out to every gallon of

1139
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,239
water that i had

1140
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,440
if i'm not mistaken my ro filter was

1141
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,919
wasting

1142
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,280
it was either three or four gallons of

1143
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,639
water

1144
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,519
in order for me to get one gallon of

1145
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,078
you know zero water or neutral water for

1146
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,599
the matter

1147
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,519
and to me it's like

1148
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,960
when you're paying for four gallons or

1149
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,599
three gallons for that matter

1150
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,720
to get one gallon of you know purified

1151
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,559
water i just

1152
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,399
i kind of stopped using that then i went

1153
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,440
into

1154
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,519
buying like purified water from

1155
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,358
local places you know going to fill up a

1156
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,400
five gallon

1157
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,358
uh jug here and there or whatever i

1158
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,599
needed water

1159
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:32,639
and then after that i just kind of

1160
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,599
i started using tap water again but

1161
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,078
instead of doing a full feeding or

1162
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,400
whatever

1163
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,000
nutrients that i'm using i usually like

1164
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,039
cut that in

1165
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,880
either a half or like a quarter

1166
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,639
and that kind of offsets that

1167
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,640
whatever parts per million or what's in

1168
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:54,559
my water the negative

1169
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,358
about that though is at any given moment

1170
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,599
you know in our

1171
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,199
your city tap water there could be what

1172
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
whatever nutrients you know

1173
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,358
they try to keep it at a parts per

1174
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,920
million at a very low

1175
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,759
i guess rate but you never know what's

1176
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,119
in your water is there iron from the

1177
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
pipes in there is there

1178
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,640
more copper or zinc or whatever's in the

1179
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
water and

1180
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,400
i always try to let it sit for a couple

1181
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,200
days

1182
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,960
so any chlorine and i guess chloramine

1183
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,199
or whatever will kind of evaporate off

1184
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,000
of there before i use it

1185
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,118
and i've been having fairly decent luck

1186
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,679
doing it that way

1187
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,440
you know but i'd like to go back to

1188
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,719
doing the ro water if i could find

1189
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,880
a better ro filter but

1190
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,480
even at the end of the day i mean i

1191
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,358
think i've looked on amazon and they've

1192
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,280
got up to like the one to one ratios

1193
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,039
but there's something about wasting a

1194
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,880
gallon of water to get a good gallon of

1195
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,000
water to me at the end of the day it

1196
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,720
just doesn't seem

1197
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,039
right you know yeah three gallons to one

1198
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,239
gallon uh one gallon of three gallons

1199
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,000
is about right for the rl water now i'm

1200
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,399
in the same boat as you as far as

1201
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,960
the waste actually had a podcast with

1202
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,400
somebody else dog of the hot not sure if

1203
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,960
you know who he is but

1204
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,318
he had mentioned that he takes his um

1205
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,480
the drain line

1206
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,400
and he'll actually use it on his outdoor

1207
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,559
plants so he's not wasting

1208
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,519
that uh additional water which i thought

1209
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,880
was pretty cool

1210
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,800
and that's something i'm transitioning

1211
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,720
on to but uh yeah

1212
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,280
as far as you don't know what's in your

1213
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,759
water um the chloramine letting its

1214
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,760
uh sorry chlorine letting it sit out for

1215
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,720
24 hours so it dissipates

1216
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,240
chlorine will chloramine won't now

1217
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,598
luckily we live in las vegas we don't

1218
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,239
you have chloramine

1219
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,960
in our local water but there are some

1220
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,559
places that do

1221
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,119
so for anybody watching that you might

1222
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,199
want to check your local water report

1223
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,800
see if you have chlorine or chloramine

1224
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,199
because you would take

1225
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,800
different routes for that i believe you

1226
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,279
can just filter out the chloramine if

1227
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,480
you

1228
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,720
had chloramine instead of chlorine yeah

1229
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,920
all right let's move on to temperature

1230
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,118
and humidity

1231
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,800
what do you typically run for

1232
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,240
temperature and humidity in your small

1233
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,079
grow spaces

1234
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,358
this is another one of those questions

1235
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,560
that a lot of people are going to

1236
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,719
probably

1237
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,000
i feel like i'm that grower that's like

1238
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,799
borderline i

1239
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,400
almost break every rule possible or try

1240
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,160
to come as close to it you know

1241
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,800
i know the ideal humidity is

1242
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,679
what is it are the ideal temperatures in

1243
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,200
between 80

1244
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,159
what 86 and something i'm in vegas it's

1245
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,960
hot as hell

1246
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:29,118
i like i said i have the two by two

1247
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,159
tents i have two of those and i pretty

1248
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,800
much

1249
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:35,358
let my tent do what it does i i have my

1250
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
air conditioning on my house it's 78 so

1251
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,920
it kind of goes off the ambient

1252
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,280
temperature of that

1253
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,318
i also run my leds so it

1254
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,519
usually doesn't get over

1255
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:50,960
maybe 90 in my tent which is it's high

1256
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:53,280
it's pushing it in the summer time

1257
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,039
i've seen it go over that but i'll

1258
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,440
usually just kick the air down a little

1259
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,800
bit

1260
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,639
more and it'll kind of keep those

1261
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,280
temperatures down um

1262
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,078
the leds work a lot it does not

1263
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,800
alleviate

1264
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,560
all your heat but it does work a lot you

1265
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,440
know like i said i didn't really come up

1266
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,759
in that

1267
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,838
light bulb grow generation so to speak i

1268
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,839
didn't have to do the hids or the

1269
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,838
ballasts or all that extra stuff you

1270
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,960
know that i guess or a little

1271
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:21,679
a lot you know i know they've busted

1272
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,760
gorilla groves for

1273
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,440
readings because of the lights being so

1274
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,520
hot back in the day not to say that they

1275
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,679
couldn't do it maybe with these leds but

1276
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,440
i think you'd have to have

1277
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:32,879
a lot more or something like that you

1278
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,599
know so

1279
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,000
i just kind of let my tents just you

1280
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,480
know

1281
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,519
humidity wise whatever it is in there i

1282
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,679
think it's

1283
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:46,400
the watering and the feeding days are

1284
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,399
i guess the days that it is it's as

1285
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,160
humid as it's gonna get in my tents you

1286
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,160
know for the most part

1287
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:56,639
and my thermometer for the mo

1288
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,598
it always reads like low humidity you

1289
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,759
know and

1290
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,280
i have a humidifier in the box sitting

1291
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,280
in my closet i bought it

1292
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,440
one day i'm like you know what i'm gonna

1293
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,760
fix my

1294
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,358
humidity issue then i got home and i'm

1295
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,000
looking at both my tents and i'm like

1296
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,639
one humidor humidifier

1297
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,440
two tents like i was trying to think of

1298
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:17,759
a way i could like

1299
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,559
rig something up to it and poured it to

1300
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,640
both

1301
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,400
tents and then i'm like you know what no

1302
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,519
maybe i'll go buy another one and put it

1303
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,639
in there

1304
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,880
but like i said in a 2x2 by the time you

1305
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,118
put a humidifier in there

1306
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,640
unless it's like mounted hanging up

1307
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,358
something which i'm not even going to

1308
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,598
try to do like

1309
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,880
it's beneficial yes you know to keep

1310
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,599
that humidity at the

1311
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:47,039
the ideal temperature but or the ideal

1312
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,680
rating but i just weighed it man

1313
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,759
whatever

1314
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,838
it is you know i keep my thermostat in

1315
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,680
my house on 78 year round

1316
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,239
you know summertime winter time whatever

1317
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,480
it's always 78 in here so

1318
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,358
i've been lucky enough that i guess my

1319
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,559
ambient temperature kind of keeps

1320
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:07,679
my temperatures at bay but i do

1321
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,400
know that you know it could be a lot

1322
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,440
better

1323
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,480
if it was a little bit more controlled

1324
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,358
but i just it's to me it's not that big

1325
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,000
of an issue

1326
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,920
you know i i could i would probably see

1327
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,519
a better outcome at the end of the day

1328
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,639
if my plants weren't idealistic

1329
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,800
temperatures but

1330
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:28,559
i mean let's face it this plant grows

1331
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,880
from california to

1332
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,799
kuz pakistan or whatever way on the

1333
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,079
other side of the planet you know

1334
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,440
so if you get the right strain in your

1335
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,280
garden you don't have to worry about

1336
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,800
temperatures

1337
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,560
and all that other stuff you know if you

1338
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,880
get a picky strain

1339
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,480
or you know if if you get a strain it's

1340
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
great at growing in the desert and you

1341
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,719
bring it to

1342
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,159
somewhere where it's damp and humid

1343
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,879
you're probably gonna mess that strain

1344
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,920
up but

1345
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,358
you know due to the genetics so

1346
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,039
that's something else that i kind of

1347
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,199
incorporate into my crosses and

1348
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,639
everything is our temperature out here

1349
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,480
you know and in the past i've made

1350
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,838
kind of testers and sent them out and

1351
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
hey let me know how

1352
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,039
they do in your neck of the woods so to

1353
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,240
speak because

1354
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,440
i want to know in different environments

1355
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,279
you know how

1356
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,039
something that i'm growing out here may

1357
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,160
vary you know

1358
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,119
so i just try to keep it as cool as i

1359
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,000
can in there

1360
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,800
you know i on each of my tents like the

1361
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,559
flap down

1362
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,599
part that covers i guess your zippers or

1363
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,519
whatnot at the top

1364
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,160
like i wrote the idealistic temperatures

1365
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,480
what is it

1366
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:41,679
it's 86 to from everything i've read

1367
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,519
82 degrees leaf surface temperature

1368
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:44,639
is said to be ideal now if your canopy

1369
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,000
temperature is a little bit higher than

1370
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,078
that your leaf surface temperature might

1371
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,079
be a little bit lower than that so

1372
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,760
some people will run up to 85. i've

1373
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,000
heard people running up to 87. i've

1374
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,040
tried

1375
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,519
87 in the past but i've seen you know

1376
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,000
heat

1377
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,440
stress issues on my plants so i've

1378
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,199
lowered it down but i usually aim for

1379
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,599
about 80 to 82

1380
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,960
leaf surface temperature now that like

1381
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,440
you've said before the plant is going to

1382
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,000
grow

1383
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
outside of the ideal ranges for sure

1384
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,760
absolutely

1385
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,279
the plant is very resilient you can see

1386
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,160
problems and you might not see optimal

1387
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,079
growth but

1388
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,440
the plant will still grow for sure same

1389
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,039
thing with humidity right

1390
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,039
we live in the same area we struggle

1391
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,719
with i think at the natural humidity

1392
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,800
level is about 20 percent

1393
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,318
that's crazy crazy so having that

1394
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,599
humidifier in there

1395
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:32,079
i have three humidifiers i have uh

1396
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,440
i have one in my lung room which i was

1397
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,000
going to recommend to you is just having

1398
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,920
like the room

1399
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,079
that your grow tents are in maybe just

1400
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,079
control that at the ideal humidity

1401
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,519
so that way when you're exhausting out

1402
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,079
you're bringing in that ideal

1403
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,838
humidity level that might work because

1404
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,160
you're stuck with space constraints not

1405
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,400
being

1406
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,838
able with that humidifier in those small

1407
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,000
grow tents but

1408
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,358
typically for humidity i'll have like a

1409
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,358
higher humidity

1410
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,880
when the plant is uh you know on the

1411
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:01,119
seedling stage vegetation stage

1412
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,280
65 to 85 maybe when it's super young

1413
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,880
then i'll slowly reduce it and then

1414
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,680
flowering you know

1415
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,720
40 50 40 to 60 percent as a general

1416
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:14,399
range now that kind of goes against vpd

1417
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:16,239
that's optimal range is vpd um

1418
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,119
but yeah again if the plan is going to

1419
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:22,318
grow outside of those ideal ranges

1420
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,800
for sure yeah it's it's

1421
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,440
kind of funny i idealistically i would

1422
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,480
like to have

1423
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,079
all my tents in one room but just

1424
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,400
i'm in a two-bedroom kind of like

1425
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,720
roommate style apartment and

1426
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,599
everything is cramped in my room and

1427
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,519
it's

1428
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,280
temperature wise you can tell like the

1429
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,679
difference between a living room and my

1430
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,720
room it's like

1431
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,558
it's almost like walking out into the

1432
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,439
sun from the shade but it's not

1433
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,319
that drastic with you know of a change

1434
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,440
it's like you know

1435
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:56,719
if it's 90 degrees outside and

1436
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,200
you're under some shade it doesn't feel

1437
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,118
like 90 it might feel like that 85 or

1438
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,639
you know lower 80 or whatever

1439
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,039
but if you're in the sun yeah it's gonna

1440
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,159
feel like that 90 you know and my room

1441
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,838
is it's always

1442
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,519
kind of pushing that temperature that

1443
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:12,000
high temperature of the house because of

1444
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,719
the fact

1445
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,280
that the tents are in here the lights

1446
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,118
are on

1447
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,680
you know and i try to keep the majority

1448
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,640
of this stuff

1449
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,358
running at night just to kind of keep it

1450
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:28,799
cooler in here and just

1451
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,880
i guess uh kind of find a median zone

1452
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,559
for my temperature in general because if

1453
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,039
you know if i ran these lights in the

1454
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,200
daytime oh my god i should probably be

1455
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,800
ridiculously i my power bill would

1456
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,679
probably jump up a lot more due

1457
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,359
just to the my electricity as far as my

1458
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,440
air conditioning

1459
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,960
consuming a lot more to keep it cooler

1460
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,720
in here but

1461
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,400
anybody that's been in my room ever

1462
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,919
they're always like why is it so hot in

1463
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,280
here i'm like

1464
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,838
you know in the first place we live in a

1465
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,000
desert

1466
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,400
so it's not hot in here you think it's

1467
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,880
hot go outside

1468
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,160
i aim to get into everything in the one

1469
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,480
room sooner or later

1470
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,558
if i if i can get a three bedroom but

1471
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,599
yeah i like to get a house and then you

1472
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,760
know

1473
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,440
i got gross stuff all throughout my

1474
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,640
apartment kind of scattered you know

1475
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,838
there's old stuff

1476
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,679
in a bin over here and you know

1477
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,199
my master bathroom kind of has the

1478
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,000
majority of my nutrients

1479
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,318
and some spare pots and whatever and i

1480
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,639
would love to get everything in one room

1481
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,400
and just kind of concentrate on that one

1482
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,759
specific area and

1483
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,440
you should see me sometimes i'm

1484
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,079
transplanting i gotta go in this room to

1485
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,480
get a pot

1486
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,160
and over here to get you know some great

1487
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,079
white or some type of root

1488
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,759
inoculant or something you know and it's

1489
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,480
just like man if everything was in one

1490
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,240
spot i wouldn't have to do all this but

1491
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,679
that's my goal sooner or later is just

1492
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,239
to get everything in

1493
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,838
one spot either that or my child is

1494
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:55,039
going to have to hurry up and turn 18 so

1495
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,039
i can kick her out and take her

1496
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,599
give me your room no i'm just playing

1497
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,039
i'm not kicking her out she's probably

1498
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,559
going to be the one to take care of my

1499
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,599
old self when i turn

1500
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,559
however old and we can't do it no more

1501
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,559
i can see it now

1502
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,359
yeah would definitely be easier to have

1503
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,400
everything all in one area

1504
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,318
so all right so that being said you know

1505
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,720
we went over a decent amount of stuff

1506
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,358
in this video everything you can think

1507
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,000
about

1508
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,078
in regards to growing in small spaces

1509
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,719
what advice would you have for somebody

1510
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,720
who's

1511
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:32,558
new to growing in small spaces research

1512
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,558
do your research do your research do

1513
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,319
your research you know unless your daddy

1514
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,359
wore bucks and you got money to blow

1515
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:41,679
wasting on

1516
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:46,400
trying to do everything you know like

1517
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:47,598
gardening in general can be the most

1518
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,720
simplistic

1519
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,318
thing in the world or it can be the most

1520
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,919
complicated it's just kind of what you

1521
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,679
make out of it

1522
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,318
um you know you got some guys out there

1523
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,558
it's i know you mentioned you're trying

1524
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,119
to get down to simplicity and efficiency

1525
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,160
and you know making everything as simple

1526
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,160
as possible for you

1527
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,358
because let's face it at the end of the

1528
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,039
day gardening

1529
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,039
is not your life it's a part of your

1530
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,440
life but you have other stuff to do you

1531
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,119
know

1532
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,720
you don't want to spend your whole time

1533
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,079
sitting there babysitting literally

1534
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,639
watching the grass grow

1535
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,359
you know so just do as much research as

1536
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,400
you can

1537
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,639
um figure out what style

1538
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,559
if any that you kind of want to hone in

1539
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,118
on because there's a lot of girl styles

1540
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,240
out there

1541
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,760
you know and some style might be better

1542
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,358
for you and your environment or your

1543
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,400
atmosphere

1544
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:42,078
so just do some research i mean

1545
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,000
youtube is as long as you have internet

1546
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,599
i mean that's youtube helped me out a

1547
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,199
lot people like mr growit

1548
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,800
and oh my gosh i'm having brain farts

1549
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,519
right now everybody that i learned from

1550
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,880
is probably like

1551
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,440
this guy there's a large community on

1552
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,440
youtube

1553
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,039
i've kind of started seeking out a

1554
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,000
little bit more knowledge as far as the

1555
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:05,119
gardening community in general because

1556
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,679
last year i bought it

1557
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,440
two by four by like five and a half ten

1558
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,719
and i started

1559
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,318
indoor gardening so

1560
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,759
i'm trying to alleviate like some of the

1561
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,599
fruits and vegetables or at least the

1562
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,280
vegetables that i buy the tomatoes and

1563
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,240
lettuce and i'm always at the store

1564
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,519
getting because

1565
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:26,719
their shelf life isn't all that you know

1566
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,880
long for the most part so if i can

1567
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,639
take that eliminate that cost and grow

1568
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,400
it myself here you know i could always

1569
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,000
have stuff for salads and

1570
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,798
herbs and spices and whatnot around and

1571
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,679
that's kind of let me branch out my

1572
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,119
gardening

1573
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,798
if you can grow your own fruits and

1574
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,760
vegetables or a little bit of

1575
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,199
substance for yourself that's one less

1576
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,520
thing you got to worry about you know if

1577
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,679
the

1578
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,960
if the s ever hits the fan at the end of

1579
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,159
the day so

1580
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,000
i think that's really good advice for

1581
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,759
sure okay so

1582
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,199
wrapping things up how can the listeners

1583
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,160
find you and what do you have upcoming

1584
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,318
in the future

1585
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,519
i'm on just about every social platform

1586
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,838
some more than others

1587
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:06,318
um youtube probably has the biggest

1588
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:10,480
collection of my work

1589
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:13,119
i guess videos so to speak um instagram

1590
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,559
you know i have i guess of course photos

1591
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,119
on their short videos

1592
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,040
