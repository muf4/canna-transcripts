1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,759
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,919
and you're watching my extras channel

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,559
mars hydro sent me over there fc

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,160
3000 led grill light and in this video i

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,239
am going to unbox the unit

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,839
i'm going to test the power output and

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,199
i'm going to do a heat test on it i'm

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,320
not gonna go over all the specs that

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,840
this urlite has

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
but i will leave a link down in the

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,640
description section below so you can

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
click on that if you want to learn more

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,679
about this light

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,198
okay first thing out the box is the

16
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,640
fixture

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
after that you can see they have

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,520
included a sheet of stickers

19
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,280
here is the meanwhile driver as you can

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
see they already have pieces attached to

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,520
it

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
so all you have to do is place onto the

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
fixture and then tighten the screws

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,239
to secure they've included a set of rope

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,920
ratchet hangers

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:51,198
here's the power cord a cable

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,840
and the user manual for the part test

28
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,280
i'm going to use the apogee mq620

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
extended range par meter

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,198
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,198
to 1040 nanometers

32
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,799
and the measurements are in ppfd this

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,719
light does have a dimmer on it

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,359
for the part test i'm going to set it to

35
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
100 so it's operating at full power

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,280
i do these part tests just to give you a

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,599
general idea of what the power output is

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
they're not meant to be 100 accurate i

39
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,399
take measurements and grow tents which

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
have reflective walls

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
that will increase the numbers so just

42
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,039
keep that in mind the coverage area for

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
this grow light is

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,080
four feet by four feet for veg and three

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
feet by three feet for flower i'm going

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,719
to take measurements in a four foot by

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
four foot grow tent

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,920
and i'll take measurements at three

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,280
different distances 12 inches

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
18 inches and 24 inches since 18 inches

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,719
and 24 inches are

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
veg recommended height distances i'll

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,239
move my par meter around

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
the entire footprint and then for the 12

55
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,879
inch measurements which are recommended

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,478
for the flowering stage

57
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,719
i'll keep my par meter in a three foot

58
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,319
by three foot area i plug the led grill

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,879
light into my kilowatt meter and it

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,438
shows

61
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,399
2.48 amps pulling 295 watts from the

62
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,438
wall

63
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
all right let's get into the

64
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
measurements

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:03:44,569
