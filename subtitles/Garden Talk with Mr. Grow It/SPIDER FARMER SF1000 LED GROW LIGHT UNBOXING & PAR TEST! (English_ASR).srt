1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,688
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,609
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,609
you're watching my extra channel here I

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,410
have the spider farmer SF 1000 LED grow

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,928
light in this video I'm gonna unbox the

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,250
unit and also test the power output if

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,570
you want to know about the specific

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,879
features of this grow light or

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,170
specifications I will provide a link to

10
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,299
it in the description section below

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,449
after I open the box and pull out the

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,089
contents first up is a spider farmer VIP

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,699
card they've included some plant tags a

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,308
thank you card have a pretty nice user

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,410
manual here and now my cats teller is

16
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,689
gonna join us she's excited to see what

17
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,669
else is in the package after moving the

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,500
top you can see the LED grow light which

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,840
does have the driver and power cord

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,299
attached they've included wire hangers

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,100
and to ratchet hangers in this bag and

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,049
then lastly they've also included

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,390
measuring tape for the part test I'm

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,089
going to use the appo gmq 500 par meter

25
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,000
this meter measures from 389 nanometers

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,280
to 692 nanometers plus or minus 5

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,689
nanometers so if there's any light being

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,579
emitted from the scroll light that's

29
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,679
outside of this range it won't show on

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,368
this par meter measurements are shown in

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,810
ppfd

32
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,579
and this is just going to give you a

33
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,900
general idea of what the power output is

34
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,908
it's not meant to be a hundred percent

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,560
accurate I am taking measurements in a

36
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,570
grow tent which does have reflective

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,000
walls that could increase these part

38
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,739
numbers so just keep that in mind this

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,228
LED grow light has a flowering coverage

40
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,908
area of 2 foot by 2 foot I'm gonna take

41
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:25,978
measurements in a two foot by four foot

42
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,810
grow tent so I'll keep the light to the

43
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,150
side of the tent and keep the meter

44
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,290
within a two foot by two foot space I'm

45
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,140
gonna take measurements at three

46
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,020
different distances 12 inches away 18

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,210
inches away and 24 inches away now let's

48
00:01:37,019 --> 00:05:10,389
take a look at the measurements

49
00:01:38,209 --> 00:05:10,389
[Music]

50
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,470

51
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,569
let me know in the comment section below

52
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,009
again I have provided a link to this

53
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,598
grow light in the description section

54
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,520
below and I'll leave it at that

55
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:27,060
thank you so much for watching and until

56
