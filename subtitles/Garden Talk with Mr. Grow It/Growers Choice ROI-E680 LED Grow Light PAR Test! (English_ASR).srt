1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,600
what is up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,200
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,960
and today i've got a part test video for

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,559
you this is the roi e680 led grow light

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
i actually did an unboxing video on my

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,839
main channel i'll link that in the

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
description section below

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,679
in this video i'm just gonna do the par

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
measurements so i'm not going to be

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,719
talking about any of the features or

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
anything like that now the meter i'm

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,759
using is the apogee mq 500 this measures

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,278
just a certain range it measures from

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,719
389 nanometers to 692 nanometers plus or

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,159
minus five nanometers so if any light is

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,399
being emitted from this grow light

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,359
outside of that range it will not be

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
shown

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,359
according to the listing for this light

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,799
it emits 1700 micro micromoles per

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,799
second ppf

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
this meter is going to measure in ppfd

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,038
so it's a spot check

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
if you're not sure what i mean by ppf or

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,359
pvfd you may want to read my buyer's

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,239
guide on led grow lights i explain what

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,238
those are in that article as well as

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,320
some other good information that is good

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,000
to know when searching for an led grill

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
light i'll link that buyer's guide in

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
the description section below so for

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
this light i'm going to take four

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
different uh height measurements i'm

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
going to start off six inches which is

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,399
what it says in the owner's manual then

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
i'll go up to eight inches which is what

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
it says i believe on the website

38
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,478
i'll go to 12 inches and then i'll do

39
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,319
one that's 24 inches

40
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,478
this does have a dimmer on it on the

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,199
screen i'll show what percent it is

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,879
dimmed so it starts off 100 you can dim

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,400
it down to 80

44
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,759
then 60 then 40 so keep an eye on the

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,478
screen and then you'll see what

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,400
percentage uh this unit is dimmed down

47
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,039
i'll start off six inches away

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
this is a two inch sensor so really the

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
height is

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,000
six inches from the top of the sensor to

51
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
the light i'm really not going to talk

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
in this video maybe towards the end

53
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,840
i'm going to let the measurements do the

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
talking

55
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:50,590

56

[Music]

57
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:32,480
[Music]

58
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:43,258
so

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:43,259
[Music]

60
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,399
so

61
00:04:52,699 --> 00:05:06,939
[Music]

62
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:45,160
[Music]

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
so

64
00:05:47,069 --> 00:06:01,209
[Music]

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:18,000
my

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:19,130
[Music]

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:35,839
oh

68
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:37,290
[Music]

69
00:06:35,839 --> 00:07:20,399
more

70
00:06:37,290 --> 00:07:22,020
[Music]

71
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:46,079
so

72
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:47,969
[Music]

73
00:07:46,079 --> 00:09:35,319
my

74
00:07:47,970 --> 00:09:35,320
[Music]

75
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:48,460
[Music]

76
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,799
all right so i will actually be growing

77
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
with this light and i just wanted to

78
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,278
take a few minutes to go over kind of

79
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,439
the results and what i'm going to hang

80
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,360
the light at for the different stages of

81
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,279
growth so when my plants are in seedling

82
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
stage or if i'm putting any clones

83
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,759
underneath it

84
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,759
i think i'm going to do 24 inches away

85
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,919
dim down to 40

86
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,399
uh basically the ppfd reading dead

87
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,039
center was at 380 and

88
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,278
uh the reading actually in the last the

89
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,759
corner diode when i brought that

90
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,519
sensor up all the way into the corner

91
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,078
right underneath that last diode is kind

92
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,959
of where i paused the video and i got a

93
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,559
319 reading on that corner diode for

94
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,679
seedlings of clones i usually aim

95
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,439
between 200 and 400 ppfd so that's right

96
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,599
there in that range my plates for the

97
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,800
vegetation stage i think i'm going to do

98
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,879
i got a couple different measurements

99
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,799
here not sure which one i'm going to do

100
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,039
at 24 inches away 80 percent dimmed dead

101
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,838
center comes in at 750

102
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,639
and then that corner diode comes in at

103
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,760
580. so for plants in the vegetation

104
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,039
stage between 400 and 600 ppfd is what i

105
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,679
aim for

106
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:21,120
another height distance that appealed to

107
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,399
me was 12 inches away 40 percent dimmed

108
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,039
down to

109
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,639
dead center came in at 554 and then that

110
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,719
corner diode came in at 359 ppfd so

111
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,439
right in the range where i want to be

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,480
for vegetation stage maybe that 12 inch

113
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,720
distance at 40 is for early veg because

114
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,278
the ppfd number is a little bit lower

115
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,320
and then later on in veg it looks like

116
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,759
the 24 inches away 80

117
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
would be kind of better for late in the

118
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,559
vegetation stage when it comes to

119
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
flowering i actually have three

120
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,919
different distances here that kind of

121
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,679
stuck out for me so i guess for early

122
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,479
flower maybe 12 inches away 60 dimmed

123
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,039
down dead center came at 800 the corner

124
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
diode came in at 600 so usually between

125
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,919
600 and 900 ppfd is what i aim for in

126
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,479
flowering another distance that stuck

127
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,599
out was 24 inches away 100

128
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,399
the dead center was 922 and that corner

129
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,680
diode was 700. the last one that stuck

130
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,039
out for flowering uh was 12 inches away

131
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,919
80 percent it came in at 11 20

132
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,599
ppfd in the dead center and then 750 on

133
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,000
that corner diode now some of you guys

134
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,159
might say 1120 that's a little bit too

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
much four pints of flowering especially

136
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,958
since i just said i like to go for 600

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,919
to 900 ppfd one way you can get away

138
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,399
with running a higher ppfd and the one i

139
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,958
recommended is running co2 so i actually

140
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,879
do i have been running co2 this last

141
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,239
girl on my phenol grow series on my

142
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,480
patreon page

143
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,519
i did run those uh co2 canisters by tmb

144
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
naturals

145
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:59,120
and just having additional 100 200 ppf

146
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,440
i'm sorry 100 to 200 ppm of co2

147
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,078
added to my environment will allow me to

148
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
run a higher ppfd number so that's why i

149
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,199
figured i'd mention that one that one

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
stuck out that's what i have four

151
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,480
measurements where i think i'm gonna run

152
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,000
what do you think about these

153
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,159
measurements let me know in the comment

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
section below and i'll leave it at that

155
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,958
thank you so much for watching and until

156
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,958
next time peace
