1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:06,120
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,750
you're tuned into my extras channel here

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,580
I have the bloom + DP 1500 LED grow

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,949
light they sent me over this girl light

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,990
in order to do an unboxing and park test

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,390
video I'm also going to do a heat test

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,579
on it jumping right into it first thing

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,429
out the box is the user manual which

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:27,179
includes information on the BP 1000 the

11
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,768
BP 1500 and the BP 3000 it also includes

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,448
some Gro tips such as recommended

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,269
hanging Heights and assembly

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,579
instructions next out the box is the

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,739
fixture this fixture does come with the

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,539
power cord attached to it and last thing

17
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,689
in this bag they include some wire

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,460
hangers and two rope ratchets I'm not

19
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,229
gonna talk about all of the features in

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,609
this video but I will leave a link to

21
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,648
this grow light in the description

22
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,628
section below so you can learn more for

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,539
the part test I'm gonna use the apogee

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:58,409
mq 500 power meter this meter measures

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,870
from 389 animators to 692 nanometers and

26
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,698
the measurements are in ppfd if this

27
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,438
fixture is emitting any light outside of

28
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,750
that range it will not show on this

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,339
meter and this part test is really just

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,170
to give you a general idea of what the

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,659
power output is it's not meant to be

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,640
exact I'm taking measurements in a grow

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,710
tent which has reflective walls that

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,719
could increase the numbers so just keep

35
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,640
that in mind the flowering coverage area

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,079
is two foot by two foot and I'll be

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,180
taking measurements in a two foot by

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,039
four foot grow tent I'll do my best to

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,110
keep my par meter in a two foot by two

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,880
foot space I'll be taking measurements

41
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,859
at three different distances these are

42
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,739
the recommended distances shown in their

43
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,409
user manual twelve inches 18 inches and

44
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:40,500
24 inches ok I've plugged this light

45
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,140
into my kilowatt meter and it shows 1.17

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,090
amps pulling 143 watts

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,090
alright let's get into the measurements

48
00:01:53,750 --> 00:03:52,889
