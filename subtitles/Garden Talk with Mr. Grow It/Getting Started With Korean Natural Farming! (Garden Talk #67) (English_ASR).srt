36 hours where it's not

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,599
as fine as a blender can make something

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,800
it's as fine as a microbe

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,518
eating it

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
and

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:33,039
passing it through its enzymatic process

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,679
and spitting out the raw materials or

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,640
the plant nutrients that's how fine it

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,159
is product when finished correctly is

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,679
better than anything you can buy on the

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,199
shelf for the cost of a potato and a few

20

grams of salt you're gonna have

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
tell us a little bit about yourself and

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,840
kind of how you got into gardening yeah

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,360
yeah i um i was born on the big island

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,680
of hawaii and the um

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,400
i was born on a farm we were doing some

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,438
livestock as a kid and

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,920
and

116
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,438
my dad when i was pretty young got into

117
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,560
macadamia nuts

118
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,959
and then after college um

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,839
and some some work i

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,840
decided to go back to farming and uh

121
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,000
helped my family farm transition to

122
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,478
organic i learned natural farming in the

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,478
process as we needed a tool

124
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,199
that made more sense than traditional

125
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,519
organic but yeah i managed

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
our 750 acre

127
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,799
macadamia farm with my dad for about

128
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,519
eight years and uh then have been

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
involved since the last six years

130
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,359
my brothers now manage it and they're

131
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,119
doing a great job

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
um

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,199
yeah but i've since then have been i

134
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,439
managed a three acre farm in idaho for a

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
while and have

136
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
popped all around in

137
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,799
different places in the world and in the

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
country

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,038
working with farmers and

140
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,198
and

141
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,199
you know kind of teaching how to tend to

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
the microbial life the soil and partner

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,478
with nature so

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,880
pretty deep down that rabbit hole

145
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,599
somewhere along the line i think in

146
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,439
managing our farm and having to sort out

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
the details of

148
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,800
what we were doing in our process i

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,600
think i probably got a couple degrees in

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,000
microbiology just

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,759
continuing to learn and

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,439
so i've had the opportunity to um

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
advise uh

154
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,000
a doctorate thesis program in korea

155
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,879
congress university i still work with

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,918
them

157
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,399
um

158
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,839
i was asked to be on the research and

159
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,399
development board the international

160
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,599
macadamia society is the work on our

161
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,318
farm so i spoke in china a few times

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
over the last few years

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,960
up until 2020

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,478
to room full rooms full of scientists

165
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,478
and uh

166
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,918
yeah i think um

167
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,839
i think i've really come to have an

168
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,519
appreciation for the

169
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,359
need for uh systemic change and um the

170
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
part i get to blame at

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
i think a lot of my audience probably

172
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,959
knows you from your youtube channel you

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
know i'm looking at your channel right

174
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,680
now you've got over 40 000 subscribers

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,639
just on youtube alone i'm not sure what

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,478
other platforms you're on but uh

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
you know you're really one of the

178
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,038
pioneers when it comes to

179
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,439
bringing k f over to the states and kind

180
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,959
of bringing it to a wide audience i

181
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,038
guess we should say right i mean some of

182
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,638
these videos are back from like 2016

183
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,079
2017

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,360
and if you click on one thing i just

185
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,199
want to point out is if you go to his

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,038
channel chris trump to search for it on

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,319
youtube playlists

188
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,079
there is 21 videos under a

189
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,879
chris trump how to korean natural

190
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,478
farming and this playlist alone i think

191
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,719
is

192
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,639
kind of really monumental to the move of

193
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,520
korean natural farming there's just so

194
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
much

195
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,719
detail on how to do these practices and

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,280
they're in a simplified form that's easy

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
to for a new grower to digest

198
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,918
so hats off to you on that one

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,598
you know your work is definitely noticed

200
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,359
by a large audience

201
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,680

start getting into some of these

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
practices so people can make that

205
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,478
transition over from

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
you know bottled nutrients or even

207
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,120
organic over to some more natural

208
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:38,000
farming techniques such as the korean

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,800
natural farming techniques so cool well

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,319
appreciate you and and yeah 40 000 i

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,038
think just happened so

212
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
thanks to uh all you watchers

213
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,079
let's

214
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,959
start from the beginning and assume that

215
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,038
people don't really know what k f is

216
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,038
can you talk to us about what is k f and

217
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,318
why should gardeners implement gay and f

218
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,478
practices

219
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,280
yeah um

220
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,878
so

221
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,758
really it's only in the us that

222
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
we

223
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
add the word korean to it

224
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
um

225
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,598
and uh it's because of how we you know

226
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,638
came to know it um being master cho who

227

and uh who's the creator of jadam

240
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
technology um just kind of little

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
background

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,839
this family has done a lot to

243
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,958
kind of open source share and so master

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,040
cho master kind of like sensei and

245
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
um if we were in

246
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,719
a

247
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,080
martial arts class you know masters

248
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
teacher and and uh you know um it's it's

249
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
a

250
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,799
title kind of like doctor and um

251
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,360
their work um

252
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,719
and then the freedom to kind of share

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,959
open source

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,639
um is really i think culturally the gift

255
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,958
in natural farming and something that i

256
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,720
feel like is an important

257
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,399
thing to continue and to pass on and

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
something i teach when i teach classes

259
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,399
like look how you've received this i'm

260
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,440
not there's no secret sauce being hidden

261
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,639
and held back there's not some you know

262
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
you have to

263
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,159
be you know fifth level to learn the

264
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,278
technology it's like here it's open and

265
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,600
freely shared and uh nothing held back

266
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,000
and and that's i think um

267
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
culturally something that um is really

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
important because

269
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,799
it's um i think it's part of the change

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,680
that's needed in the world you know is

271
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,278
that this isn't you know i'm sure some

272
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,719
people make a living

273
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:11,759
and um there's there's things to

274
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,920
sell and teach and whatever but

275
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,200
ultimately once you have that knowledge

276
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,278
nope there's no

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,440
uh copyright on it there's not a uh

278
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,320
you know clause or

279
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
anything and i think that's

280
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
um

281
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,079
a real

282
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,199
honor to have learned that way and to be

283
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,000
able to pass that on so i guess just a

284
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
little

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,120
footnote or stopping there for a minute

286
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,518
at that important detail that is in

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,399
natural farming um

288
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,039
the yeah it's it's practiced in

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,159
i think over 70 countries um that i know

290
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,278
of um and some of that history is uh

291
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,078
master cho traveling um and teaching he

292
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,559
got some political persecution um

293
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,958
following the korean war um because

294
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,199
there was such free sharing of

295
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,119
agricultural knowledge they marked him

296
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,278
as a communist and so there was a lot of

297
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,039
pressure and so he actually had to leave

298
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,120
the country for a while

299
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,679
under that pressure and went to india

300
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,200
and thailand and

301
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,120
and in those places it's just called

302
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,399
natural farming

303
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,639
and

304
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,679
and so i often refer to it as natural

305
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,000
farming

306
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,120
just because of that i've gotten to

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,639
travel a lot and experience those

308
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
communities and those different cultures

309
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,519
the japanese

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,278
natural farming community is amazing

311
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,560
a lot of great kind of innovation etc

312
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,278
and not a lot of it's in english sadly

313
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,919
but

314
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,559
natural farming is a

315
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,240
elegant method to partner with nature to

316
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,119
grow food

317
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,799
it's

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,879
i don't think the only way i think

319
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,679
there's a lot of traditional farming

320
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,439
technology that's incredible and you can

321
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,199
get to that same place

322
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,680
but the nice thing about natural farming

323
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,399
is it's this this beautiful package you

324
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,638
know you get this like box of technology

325
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
and the whole thing gives you everything

326
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,600
you need to really

327
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,519
be highly effective as a gardener to

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,399
produce your crop and so

329
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,679
um i think that's really

330
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,278
a special

331
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,359
aspect of what's

332
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,958
available in natural farming is just the

333
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
the kind of

334
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,078
you can master this one thing and it

335
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,399
really

336
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,319
one of the other things that it is is

337
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,559
it's a key

338
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
to understanding nature

339
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,439
not just

340
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,919
to be able to do

341
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,600
step by step a recipe but all of a

342
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,679
sudden you're like oh

343
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
that's how fermentation works and why

344
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,439
it's valuable and

345
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
i can use this to do that and i can

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
ad-lib this now that i've mastered that

347
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,159
i understand

348
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,159
and

349
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,278
so i think it's

350
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,360
it's a key to understanding natural law

351
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,799
i think as much as it's a farming

352
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,759
technique

353
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,240
and

354
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,639
yeah it's a series of recipes

355
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,639
the main one being this

356
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,919
imo process

357
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,159
where you take indigenous imo stance or

358
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,719
indigenous microorganism

359
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,958
um where you're you're taking a diverse

360
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
microbial community from a wild spot in

361
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,278
nature and re-establishing it in your

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,279
farmland and

363
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,559
that plus some of these nutrients you

364
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:31,200
can make in-house inexpensively

365
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,958
creates a wonderful tool for growing

366
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
food or medicine

367
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,359
i think there's a lot of folks in my

368
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,039
audience in particular that are bottled

369
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,839
nutrient growers right so there's

370
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,799
synthetic or mineral based nutrients

371
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,199
i myself was a bottled grower

372
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,278
you know for first six years and then i

373
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,559
transitioned over you know i learned

374
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,679
organic

375
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,319
gardening

376
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,599
whether it be an organic blend or

377
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,680
organic dry amendments and

378
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,278
now i'm kind of looking into the natural

379
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,879
farming approach so admittedly i haven't

380
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,958
yet started any

381
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,639
natural farming methods been learning

382
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,119
about it this year and i'm going to

383
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,799
actually start taking that leap so as we

384
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,159
continue to go on here know that i'm a

385
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,120
newbie when it comes to it a lot of

386
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,480
audience are newbies when it comes to it

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
but there are several benefits right i

388
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,800
mean going getting off the bottles you

389
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
can certainly save some money going into

390
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,319
the natural farming approach you can

391
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
save some time as well right you don't

392
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,040
have to mix up

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
nutrients each time you're ready to feed

394
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,159
you don't have to ph adjust the ph

395
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,679
adjust you know monitor the ppm

396
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,679
and also it's a more sustainable

397
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,799
approach to horticulture right compared

398
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,078
to

399
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,958
the bottles

400
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,359
i know one of the most common issues

401
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,239
around the world right now is the over

402
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
fertilization and the runoff of nitrogen

403
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,919
and phosphorus into our lakes and

404
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,320
streams causing toxic algae blooms

405
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,679
natural farming doesn't contribute to

406
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,920
that right so there's tons of benefits

407
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,239
out there for transitioning from either

408
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,838
bottles or even organic over to

409
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
a natural farming approach so i just

410
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
wanted to say that first before we kind

411
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,600
of move on one word that you mentioned

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,799
that i think is going to throw people

413
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,920
off a little bit is fermentation

414
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,599
so

415
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,479
fermentation we hear about fermentation

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,040
we know it's a anaerobic process and

417
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,920
generally speaking a lot of folks know

418
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,519
that anaerobic conditions can lead to

419
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,719
bad pathogens and pests particularly

420
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,519
like in your growing medium for example

421
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
however we're not talking about

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
anaerobic process within the medium

423
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,879
right we're talking about it within

424
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,320
other things

425
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,078
such as fpga ffj your your fermented

426
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,639
plant juice fermented proof juice etc

427
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:48,958
etc can you talk to us about like what

428
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,680
is fermentation and how you use it in

429
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,719
natural farming practices absolutely

430
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,679
yeah

431
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,480
that's a great question and you know my

432
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,958
my journey growing up on the farm

433
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,920
is much the same as yours

434
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,039
we were a conventional uh farm

435
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,000
so

436
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,879
bottled nutrients that came in a 40-foot

437
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,198
container and uh you know

438
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:17,439
just 30 30 30 fertilizer and roundup and

439
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,758
and even up until

440
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,680
2011

441
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
when we really started transitioning to

442
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,399
natural farming we were a split

443
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:30,000
operation so 50 of the farm about

444
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,839
400 acres was um conventional still

445
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
roundup and

446
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,160
salt fertilizers and then 50

447
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,519
was was

448
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,639
organic and organic was struggling it

449
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
was not

450
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,560
nutrient-rich it wasn't productive

451
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,639
so i have much the same journey in my

452
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,719
farming experience and then to

453
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,519
transition to natural farming and see it

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
be

455
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,039
both cost effective and production

456
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,639
effective um was really cool

457
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,278
um and so

458
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,318
yeah fun to share that

459
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,919
um fermentation

460
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,959
is um

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,759
i think

462
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
i'll

463
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,558
i'll use

464
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
fish fertilizer as an example to kind of

465
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,798
explain the concept

466
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,119
so you can go to the store and buy

467
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,759
hydrolysate

468
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
and or fish emulsion and these are

469
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,000
processes

470
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,519
where they're taking out a

471
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,480
an oil

472
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,038
or a prime product from

473
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
fish um you know they're making fish oil

474
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,919
capsules or something and then the

475
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
leftovers they're

476
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,759
throwing through an industrial blender

477
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,558
and and pasta and cooking

478
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:47,279
down till they get a um

479
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:50,240
kind of homogenized liquid um that

480
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,879
on a microscopic scale

481
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,120
that is unprocessed

482
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
giant chunks of

483
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
fish flesh

484
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
if you look at it under a microscope as

485
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,160
far as a plant leave is concerned that

486
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,519
is undigested unprocessed

487
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,279
fish so you're just taking a fish paste

488
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,480
if you spray it on your plant and you're

489
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,079
smearing

490
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
a a

491
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,639
you know a

492
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,558
fish paste onto your leaf so now that

493
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
that fish that's been applied to the

494
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,480
leaf

495
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,159
has to go through a breakdown process

496
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,519
um where it's going to get washed off

497
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,960
the leaves going to fall on the ground

498
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,400
it's going to be

499
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,000
fermented digested in place in nature

500
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
through the microbes that are there and

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,679
then become plant available very little

502
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,038
of that is immediately plant available

503
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,120
until it goes to a digestive process

504
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,440
much like the digestion that occurs in

505
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,439
our stomach

506
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,759
nature and plant assimilation of

507
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,519
nutrients is very much the same as human

508
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,599
assimilation of nutrients and human

509
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,400
assimilation of nutrients

510
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,240
doesn't happen without microbes we don't

511
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,519
have blades in our guts

512
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,679
there's nothing

513
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,558
chopping up our food turning the adp and

514
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,919
atp it's microbial decomposition along

515
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,918
with ends of enzymatic

516
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,199
processes

517
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,558
that make our food

518
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,960
assimilatable we can digest it

519
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,720
the same thing happens in nature so

520
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,360
buying these bottled

521
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,759
fish nutrients they still have to go

522
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,199
through a breakdown process to become

523
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,359
plant available that doesn't mean that a

524
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
little bit's not available initially

525
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,519
but

526
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
that that breakdown does occur and so

527
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,720
um fermented uh our fish amino acid

528
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
which is the natural farming fish

529
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,440
fertilizer takes whole fish or fish cuts

530
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,919
and heads sorry if this is you know i'm

531
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,360
jumping into the the weirdest grossest

532
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
thing you know

533
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,959
right away but i think it'll help with

534
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,519
understanding

535
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,480
these this is something that if i just

536
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,960
take

537
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
you know blended blended fish and i

538
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,569
throw it on the surface

539
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,759
i get kind of um

540
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:04,798
[Music]

541
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,400
bacteria rises up and i get anaerobic

542
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,720
conditions happening

543
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
in the as that kind of break down and

544
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
putrifies

545
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,798
um

546
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,440
whereas in natural farming we take a

547
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,558
diverse fungal inoculum

548
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,558
imo

549
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,440
and we introduce it

550
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:26,079
with a balanced um

551
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,919
amount uh by weight of sugar and we put

552
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,879
the fish and the sugar and this imo

553
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
together and this very slow fermentation

554
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
occurs

555
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,599
it actually takes a year to be perfectly

556
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
done

557
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,678
where

558
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,558
the fungi actually breaks down and and

559
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,440
yanks apart these fatty acid chains and

560
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:48,000
so this material when it's finished

561
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,919
is completely assimilatable it's

562
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,759
completely

563
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,240
plant digestible

564
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,000
i saw foliar application in the root

565
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,359
zone it doesn't have to go through a

566
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,798
secondary

567
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,678
breakdown process for it to be usable

568
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,119
to the plant and we've pre-done that in

569
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,360
fermentation

570
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:11,839
um so um what occurs is something um and

571
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,038
this is an fpga and in this fermentation

572
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,399
process something called micronization

573
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,359
where it's not

574
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
as fine as a blender can make something

575
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,038
it's as fine as a microbe

576
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,158
eating it

577
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,480
and passing it through its enzymatic

578
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,120
process and spitting out the raw

579
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,159
materials or the plant nutrients that's

580
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:37,199
how fine it is and that's a that's a the

581
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
difference from a mac truck to a marble

582
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,519
on a microbiological or on a

583
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,559
micronization scale so

584
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,158
spraying

585
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,079
hydrolysate on your leaves you've

586
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,840
sprayed mac trucks those need to be

587
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,359
broken down to marbles so they can pass

588
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,319
through the cell walls

589
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,158
um in faa we've already gone down

590
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,720
through that micronization process and

591
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,360
so now it's the size of

592
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,519
marbles so to speak yeah so i hope that

593
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,519
kind of helps into why we mess around

594
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,400
with fermentation there's more to it but

595
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,798
that's

596
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,840
maybe a crash course speaking to the

597
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,759
that aerobic versus anaerobic aerobic is

598
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,639
what we want in our root zone absolutely

599
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,919
100 percent but

600
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
the

601
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,720
the reality is that anaerobic and

602
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,240
aerobic processes happen in root zones

603
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,159
all over the place you have a pocket of

604
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,000
nutrients in a forest leaves fall that

605
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
initial layer if the big wind storm

606
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
comes up leaves pile up in a corner a

607
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,759
bunch of the center of that becomes

608
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,558
anaerobic and that's how those nutrients

609
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,519
get processed down that pre-processing

610
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,558
then becomes ready food for the aerobic

611
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,960
microbes than to to go through and eat

612
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,279
and so it's really neat that it's

613
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,319
um it's a whole picture of nature and

614
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,079
not just there's good guys and bad guys

615
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,879
and everybody's coming to understand

616
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,798
that

617
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,360
that makes sense so

618
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,679
for the do folks what natural farming

619
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,798
practice do you suggest that gardeners

620
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,960
start with first you know i um there's a

621
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:10,319
best and i would say um in general

622
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,798
begin to learn and master the process of

623
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,839
making im04

624
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,200
and that is literally going to be i i

625
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,359
tell people it's going to be about a

626
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,880
year learning curve you're going to

627
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,798
spend about a year

628
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,799
learning how to do this

629
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,038
begin that journey so that you're not

630
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,639
starting a year from now on a year

631
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,640
learning journey

632
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,759
and and just trust that there'll be

633
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,480
failure it's like you're learning guitar

634
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,038
totally worth it and a ton of fun but a

635
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,798
learning journey

636
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,038
but

637
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:47,119
real easy entry easy to start um

638
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,119
master chose sun so that's best and

639
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,038
that's because we're in imo we're

640
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,239
producing this full

641
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,038
spectrum of beneficial microbial life

642
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,960
um

643
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,278
but master cho's son

644
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,519
you know learned this sat with farmers

645
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,599
and said oh this is too hard it's

646
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,278
challenging which i don't fully agree

647
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,480
with him i think it is

648
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,720
challenging but not too hard um

649
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,759
but he also

650
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
in his

651
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:18,240
approach to it decided he wanted to make

652
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,278
something easier and um he came up with

653
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,400
something called jms jadon microbial

654
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,240
solution and it takes potatoes

655
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,360
and a little bit of rice and some

656
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,480
microbes and that can brew out in 24 to

657
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,599
36 hours and a bucket in your kitchen

658
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
and

659
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,678
that

660
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,000
is full of yeast and beneficial bacteria

661
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,720
it doesn't have a ton of fungi in it

662
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,960
other than whatever just washes off your

663
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,440
initial material

664
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
but that is pretty low-hanging fruit as

665
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,759
far as

666
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,200
you could

667
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,919
know nothing

668
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,159
when you started this podcast

669
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,278
take that three-letter acronym

670
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,720
go watch my youtube on it and make it in

671
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,960
the next hour

672
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
and be applying it to your garden

673
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,558
successfully

674
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,679
in 36 hours with with no learning curve

675
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,558
so i would say that is a great way to

676
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,720
get and and i would say that product

677
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,720
when finished correctly is better than

678
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,600
anything you can buy on the shelf as far

679
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
as

680
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:26,158
bugs in a jug microbial solution so for

681
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,360
the cost of a potato and you know a few

682
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,120
grams of salt you're going to

683
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,038
you're going to have something that's

684
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,278
you know more than 100 a gallon in value

685
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,400
so yeah i would say jms is a great way

686
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,798
to condition your soil and um and get

687
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
those nutrients cycling

688
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,639
meanwhile learn that imo process and

689
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,278
then liquid imo can be made with an imo

690
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
2. that's probably an easy thing to jump

691
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,400
into too and that's something i

692
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,278
developed

693
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,120
and now um my teacher master cho teaches

694
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,960
when he teaches natural part

695
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,439
that's incredible let's get a little bit

696
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,079
deeper diamond you mentioned imo4 but i

697
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,320
know there's like imo one i am m2 so

698
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,879
qrikman from these are different stages

699
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,678
of imo you already kind of touch base on

700
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,679
what imo is indigenous microorganisms

701
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,278
but how do you how do you make it and

702
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,559
how do you use it absolutely so

703
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,720
in a untouched forest um you know a

704
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,319
thousand years of just

705
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,000
being left alone

706
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:32,558
um balance gets struck in nature um

707
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,679
the blacksmith moves to town the doctor

708
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,639
moves to town the grocer the farmer

709
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,559
the

710
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,480
you know transporter

711
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,798
all of these players have now struck a

712
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
you know balance think the wild west in

713
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,440
a small prairie town everybody needs to

714
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,360
be there and now you have the whole

715
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
picture of the community everybody doing

716
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,599
their part

717
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,918
and all necessary and all very different

718
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,439
in nature in an untouched area an

719
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,759
interior area that's healthy and diverse

720
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,960
those things those balances have

721
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,400
happened and what we can do

722
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:15,278
as farmers cultivating life

723
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,278
is we can go to these areas and um

724
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,960
harvest

725
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,960
that diverse

726
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,759
kind of uh

727
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,159
uh

728
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,200
capture it and bring it into our farming

729
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,039
systems

730
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
and um

731
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,119
one of the ways we do that is this i am

732
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,120
a one process

733
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,519
um where we

734
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,839
go out into the forest with some rice

735
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,158
and that rice has a high fat protein

736
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,558
profile so it's good fungal food it's

737
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,240
like an auger for fungi to grow on

738
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,839
and

739
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,399
and that

740
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:52,558
bloom now ideally has a

741
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,639
wonderful diversity

742
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,158
from nature and so

743
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
i just got the

744
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
great

745
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,440
gift of being able to submit samples a

746
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,879
bunch of my students submitted samples

747
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
to

748
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
a

749
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,398
dna

750
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,240
mapping lab where they mapped the dna of

751
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,158
a bunch of im04

752
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,440
and we had

753
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,640
some

754
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,960
200 species of fungi

755
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,799
and a single you know a handful of imo 4

756
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,919
and some

757
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,119
800 species of bacteria and yeast

758
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
and

759
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,479
you know just an incredible

760
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,319
uh array of diversity and so

761
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,120
just through this simple process like

762
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,398
you said that this stages so imo 1 is

763
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:44,398
rice in a forest imo 2 is the process of

764
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,639
causing that imo 1 to go dormant

765
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,798
which is important because we if we're

766
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,320
not using it right away we don't want it

767
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,158
to continue to

768
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,079
cycle down if you will and lose

769
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,200
diversity we want it to kind of stay as

770
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,079
a cryo freeze snapshot of the diversity

771
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,240
that we got that day one out of nature

772
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,960
and so we mix it with rice kind of like

773
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
you

774
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,759
put fish and salt for a long sea voyage

775
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,520
it keeps it from breaking down over time

776
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,519
so that imo2 is kind of the

777
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,759
stabilization of the imo1 im03 is taking

778
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,359
a small amount of that and causing it to

779
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,759
grow out

780
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,000
on a substrate we use rice bran and oats

781
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,519
are kind of the ideal substrate

782
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,240
along with wood chips and then some

783
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,440
nutrients like humic acid sea salt

784
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
um

785
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,640
fpj ohn brown rice vinegar so these

786
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,960
natural farming nutrients

787
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,120
it's it's kind of creating a party for

788
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,919
microbes to thrive in and grow

789
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,879
and then imo 4 we bring some of our

790
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,240
farms soil so if you're growing indoors

791
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,559
you could actually take some of your

792
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
potting soil and include that in the

793
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,558
grow out process

794
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,399
and you come up with incredible

795
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,119
incredible uh

796
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,678
final product by the time you get to the

797
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,239
fourth stage of imo uh

798
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,960
process you have a very

799
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,038
wonderful and diverse product that's um

800
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,200
it's never gonna shock your plants and

801
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,278
it moves right in and you

802
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
um it's it's like a giant engine you're

803
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,038
building kind of an engine and the

804
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,120
components are all these microbes and so

805
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,960
once you get it going now it's cycling

806
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:27,439
nutrients and uh you can you can take a

807
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,319
living soil garden bed and just top

808
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,360
dress it with kind of raw compost

809
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,439
and

810
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,000
and all that microbial life in there

811
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,759
just starts processing it and uh it's

812
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,640
like gas to the engine just keeps it

813
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,519
going

814
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,480
and you have very little effort needed

815
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,319
to feed your plants other than maybe

816
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
you've got a bokashi barrel where you

817
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,720
throw your food scraps in or you know

818
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
and and you just top dress your your

819
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,960
leftovers from your dinners and

820
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,960
breakfast you know and that's that's

821
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,399
your nutrients for your plants and the

822
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,640
reason that works and just doesn't

823
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,918
become a stinky mass

824
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,080
is because

825
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,919
there's this diverse microbial community

826
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,519
and then earthworms are are going to be

827
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,559
able to thrive there because they eat

828
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,399
those microbes um and

829
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,480
yeah it becomes a really

830
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,558
a living system like nature so you're

831
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,360
taking natural law

832
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:22,480
and and partnering with it using

833
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,319
the the building blocks of soil which

834
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,720
are really the builders are these

835
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,639
microbes and they are what cause soil to

836
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
be something other than

837
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
dirt

838
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,558
you know um

839
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,759
it becomes a

840
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,839
living ecosystem and um and so in the

841
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,919
natural farming process we can kind of

842
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,639
create and capture

843
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,880
that system and use it to our advantage

844
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,960
so imo for what's your general

845
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,519
recommendation for applica application

846
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,798
for medicinal plants for example yeah i

847
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,519
have a i have a short video called uh

848
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,359
applying a natural imo

849
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,480
application or something

850
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,158
um but it's um you you take this solid

851
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,880
material and you apply it at about 330

852
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,320
pounds per quarter acre or about a

853
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,320
gallon for 100 square feet so a 10 by 10

854
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,960
bed would have about a gallon it's a

855
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,798
very small amount it's think of it as

856
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,798
like cover crop seed

857
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,240
you know you're taking all these fungal

858
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,480
spores if you look at it under the

859
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,278
microscope it's full of just marbles

860
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,720
little fungal spores you throw it out on

861
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,159
your soil

862
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,558
with a little bit of moisture and it

863
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,039
wakes up and blooms and moves in and

864
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:35,759
multiplies and so it's really just an

865
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,798
inoculum it's a very high quality

866
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,558
inoculum like nothing you can buy

867
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,599
um and

868
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,240
yeah so yeah a small amount you could

869
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,759
top dress as much as an inch a solid

870
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,640
inch of this material and it wouldn't

871
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,038
hurt if you have more apply more yeah

872
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,880
it's it's great

873
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,640
another way to go about it is you take

874
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,320
that finished material you can store it

875
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,799
in like grandma cedar

876
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,200
chest you know that blanket chest or or

877
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,319
a little you know lunch box you make or

878
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,519
something at a theater and um and you

879
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,839
use a handful of that in a in a brew

880
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,960
for like a five gallon bucket

881
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,678
and uh you can you can cause it to bloom

882
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,519
in a water column and in the right

883
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,320
conditions and so

884
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,480
you can spray that foliarly i really

885
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,158
like that because

886
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
in nature we have

887
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,880
all these microbes actually live in the

888
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,600
sphyllosphere of a plant so

889
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,278
on the the leaves

890
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,759
if you look at it under a microscope

891
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,679
it's covered in fungi and bacteria and

892
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,440
yeast and that actually is its

893
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,240
protection we have the same thing going

894
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
on in our skin we exude

895
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,640
we

896
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,038
have you know salts and nutrients coming

897
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,559
out of our pores and there's lactic acid

898
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,519
bacteria and all these other microbes

899
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,759
that actually thrive on that materials

900
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,798
and live symbiotically in our skin and

901
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,519
we rely on them for protection from

902
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:06,398
disease and plants are the same way so i

903
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,839
like liquid imo for that purpose

904
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,239
liquid imo

905
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,078
for a lot of uh like

906
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,878
medicinal plants

907
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,159
um and even just general gardens we're

908
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:21,358
applying that at about uh once a week

909
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,079
foliarly um with great effect um

910
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,480
incredible um effect just by applying

911
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,119
that once a week gotcha another one that

912
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,358
you mentioned was lab lactic acid

913
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,039
bacteria i'd like to get into that next

914
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,319
um i did watch your video on that on

915
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,239
youtube so straightforward so easy to do

916
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,720
can you talk to us about lactic acid

917
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,799
bacteria you know what is it how do you

918
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,279
make it how do you use it etc yeah so um

919
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,200
lactic acid bacteria is this incredible

920
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,280
part of nature um in our systems we're

921
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,559
outnumbered about one trillion to one

922
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,839
for every human cell there's a a

923
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,838
trillion microbe cells in our bodies

924
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,119
so

925
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,838
um 70

926
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,440
of those are lactobacilli family

927
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:11,679
microbes and so our gut is mostly

928
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,559
lactobacilli family microbes

929
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,118
and

930
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,199
without those we don't do very well

931
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:22,400
we we desperately need uh lactose lactic

932
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,799
acid bacteria to um

933
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,680
to process our nutrients they're they're

934
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,280
like a trash collector or digester

935
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,399
they're um

936
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
they're a

937
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,039
facultative anaerobe so they thrive in

938
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:40,719
both anaerobic and aerobic conditions

939
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:43,920
they're a very important um

940
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:47,118
absolutely vital part of nature

941
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,280
you die all human life ceases without

942
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,160
lack of stimuli family microbes

943
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
um

944
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,838
we we have names for the medical

945
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,160
conditions when you get those that

946
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:59,440
diversity knocked out in your gut

947
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,799
and it's interesting we have a um a

948
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,159
medical process called uh

949
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
fmt

950
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:10,480
fecal microbiota transplant

951
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,480
and where if somebody's gut biome gets

952
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,079
knocked out through

953
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,320
you know

954
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,320
extenuating circumstances or

955
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,119
antibiotics or something like that we

956
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,639
actually take the healthy gut biome of a

957
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,200
healthy person

958
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,920
freeze dry it put in capsules and and

959
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,319
give it as an uh a

960
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
digestible pill or suppository to the

961
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,838
unhealthy person

962
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,320
re-establishes diversity and now they

963
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,039
can digest their food again

964
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,838
i met in china i met the guy who came up

965
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,960
with fmt and he was tickled pink because

966
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,320
i actually incorporated it in my uh

967
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,880
my speech

968
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,000
to the um my peers and macadamia nuts

969
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,680
and uh you know so room full of 500

970
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,838
people and he's just like i can't

971
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,000
believe you brought it into agriculture

972
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,480
i love that um

973
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,480
but lactic acid bacteria is good for

974
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,119
human health and plant health

975
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
and um it can be you know a lot of

976
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,559
people

977
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,159
um really kind of things i heard on the

978
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,159
internet they take

979
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,399
um

980
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,000
lab and it's like the one thing they

981
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,119
take away from the natural farming

982
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,639
process

983
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,480
and i would say that's kind of like

984
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,879
taking five percent

985
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,039
of the story and running with it but you

986
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,440
know that's okay you know some people

987
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,279
have great success and they report all

988
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
kinds of wonderful things just by using

989
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,240
that

990
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,639
but it is a small part of it in imo

991
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,358
production so in the whole imo 4 process

992
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,118
you have all the ilab you'll ever need

993
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,239
it's it's abundant so if you're making

994
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,280
liquid imo chocked full of led

995
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:58,159
and so you don't really need to do

996
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,480
the lab kind of process but

997
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,279
what i use lab for

998
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
even though i'm farming with imo is i

999
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,760
make it and i have it in the fridge and

1000
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,720
i consume it regularly for people with

1001
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,720
gi gastrointestinal issues it's

1002
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,399
massively helpful

1003
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,399
for

1004
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
you know

1005
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,920
skin or topical health or kind of

1006
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,719
subtopical health people

1007
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,760
can

1008
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,118
take it

1009
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
apply it to their skin

1010
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,280
and get a

1011
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,560
huge relief from stuff like yeast

1012
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,800
infections and you know um

1013
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,679
dr hoon park who's

1014
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,839
a

1015
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,118
peer of mine and a good friend and

1016
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,880
somebody that really helped bring

1017
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,240
natural farming to

1018
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920
the u.s

1019
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,479
has crohn's disease and he's been

1020
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,280
asymptomatic for over 10 years because

1021
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,559
he takes an ounce of lab in his water

1022
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,240
with every meal and so he as a

1023
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,400
medical doctor

1024
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,239
when people come in with gi issues he

1025
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,639
just gives them a sheet on how to make

1026
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,959
lab and says go and drink this with your

1027
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,319
meals and people are

1028
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,639
and so i've had friends cry because they

1029
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,359
ate food that they couldn't eat for the

1030
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,759
first time without getting stomach you

1031
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,920
know violent stomach cramps because

1032
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,240
they're inoculating their

1033
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
their food pre-inoculating it with a sip

1034
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,399
of lab that actually is the mature the

1035
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,280
very thing necessary to digest their

1036
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,400
food

1037
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,560
and um so just yeah an incredible

1038
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,720
part of nature something that we all

1039
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,639
rely on but don't really know and

1040
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,480
natural farming gives a very simple

1041
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,639
recipe on how to make it

1042
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
that's fascinating yeah and just to

1043
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,159
reiterate for those wanting step-by-step

1044
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,599
instructions on how to do lab i mean

1045
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,358
we're kind of briefly talking about it

1046
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,280
here i'll definitely have a link to

1047
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,880
chris's youtube channel down in the

1048
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,079
description section below or if you're

1049
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,920
listening to one of the podcast

1050
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
platforms just search for his name chris

1051
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,559
trump and you can see the playlist and

1052
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,200
you can see how he makes lab one of the

1053
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:04,318
things that i noticed is that you really

1054
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,480
don't need gloves or anything to

1055
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,159
do this right you you'll see that

1056
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,039
there'll be a separation process that

1057
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,559
happens you can actually use the i guess

1058
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,119
cheese curds or something like that you

1059
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,039
can use that for a different process and

1060
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,160
then the remaining liquid that you

1061
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,759
strained

1062
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,759
is your lab and like you mentioned you

1063
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,800
can actually just drink that so

1064
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,079
that's going to be probably one of the

1065
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,240
first things i make it seemed like it

1066
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,079
was pretty easy to make but like you

1067
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,759
mentioned it's a very very small percent

1068
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,000
so i'm definitely not gonna stop there

1069
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,560
when it comes to it you know i i tell

1070
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,960
people that natural farming isn't

1071
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,799
something new it's not like

1072
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,838
we're we're teaching

1073
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,800
some new technology that we just

1074
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,639
discovered um it's something that you

1075
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,760
know a hundred years ago a lot of these

1076
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,799
things were were well known kind of

1077
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,599
tools

1078
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,318
for every household you know how to make

1079
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,519
cheese for example and consume it you

1080
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,480
know it was

1081
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,119
something that was a basic

1082
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,199
food preservation if you had milk

1083
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,160
because you didn't have refrigeration so

1084
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,078
a lot of this is things that when we had

1085
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,719
this kind of influx of chemical

1086
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,000
agriculture we just said oh grandpa's

1087
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,118
knowledge

1088
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,679
2 000 years of agricultural tradition

1089
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,760
we don't need that anymore we have 30 30

1090
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,399
30 fertilizer and so

1091
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,800
what a lot of natural farming is um it's

1092
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,760
new in that it's the the package is this

1093
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,839
elegant thing and and master cho

1094
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,560
you know if you hear stories some things

1095
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:37,279
came to him in dreams and there are bits

1096
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:40,000
and pieces that are definitely new

1097
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,280
but the the general concept of

1098
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,559
kind of using um

1099
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
natural law to grow food but also to

1100
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,759
consume food um

1101
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,240
it's it's things we used to know and uh

1102
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,000
have forgotten and so just coming back

1103
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,719
to um you know working with life i think

1104
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,440
it's important let's get into fpga and

1105
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,439
ffj so fermented plant juice and

1106
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
fermented fruit juice and greens goddess

1107
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,440
was one of the ones that had talked

1108
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,960
about this on a previous podcast

1109
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,079
and she broke it down in a simple sense

1110
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,760
to where you can use like f pj

1111
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,680
for the veg stage in ffj for the

1112
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,760
flower stage or vice versa i can't

1113
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,879
remember which one was which but uh

1114
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,800
those seem to be very important aspects

1115
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,160
of natural farming can you talk to us

1116
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,839
about what fpga and ffj are you know how

1117
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,199
to make them and kind of how to apply

1118
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,078
them in your garden

1119
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,159
sure

1120
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,400
yeah and um

1121
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:42,480
because i think a lot of online

1122
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,720
joe and jim and

1123
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:50,079
susie and john talking about natural

1124
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:51,679
farming uh fbj gets this kind of high

1125
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,318
platform

1126
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,559
because it's so easy to make and because

1127
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,599
it is a plant food

1128
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,920
or nude plant nutrient um

1129
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,800
it's kind of gotten a little bit more um

1130
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,440
play in the online space

1131
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,359
than we give it in natural farming

1132
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,358
technology

1133
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,598
so i do want to kind of

1134
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,598
nod towards that that

1135
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,800
fpga

1136
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,039
ohn

1137
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,318
all this plant nutrient

1138
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,639
processes

1139
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,559
where you're spraying on nutrients

1140
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,440
they are the twenty percent of natural

1141
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,199
farming the eighty percent being imo

1142
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,200
um and the microbes that you would get

1143
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,279
in the soil so this jms technology

1144
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,239
talking about so just kind of a quick

1145
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,560
nod to that um

1146
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,519
ffj fermented fruit juice

1147
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,920
is

1148
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,079
the um

1149
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,960
getting wild fruit

1150
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,280
so

1151
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,000
i think to talk about

1152
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,079
in this space fpj and ffj i think i need

1153
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,400
to talk about the things that i heard on

1154
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,720
the internet the misnomers real quick

1155
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,720
because there's so much of it and

1156
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,000
it's i have a friend that learned fpj

1157
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,480
and

1158
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,519
she applied

1159
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,119
the fpj as a plant nutrient to her house

1160
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,318
plant just dumped it on the soil and

1161
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,480
just

1162
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,679
on the edge of killing her house plant

1163
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,800
initially

1164
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:26,159
and quickly she made an aloe fpj

1165
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,519
um and applied it straight to the roots

1166
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,559
um

1167
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,960
at a

1168
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,279
very low dilution rate you know kind of

1169
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,679
a lot of it and um

1170
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,079
got spotting on the leaves and disease

1171
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,639
and the plant hasn't recovered

1172
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,200
2-3 months later

1173
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,719
a lot of people are saying oh i can make

1174
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,879
this plant nutrient and then they're

1175
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,879
just running with that it's like oh i

1176
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,200
have the answer to

1177
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,880
growing without bottled nutrients i'm

1178
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,960
just going to dump a bunch of fpj on

1179
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,000
things sorry i'm i'm getting into this

1180
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,480
but it's so common i get these like oh i

1181
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,318
did this it didn't work for me it's like

1182
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,880
who told you to do that oh well this

1183
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,000
website you know and um

1184
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,760
so

1185
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,280
ffj is a very narrow

1186
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,079
um kind of use where you can apply it in

1187
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,480
flowering but kind of towards the end or

1188
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,760
not not abundantly you can still use

1189
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,920
fpga

1190
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:29,200
in that flowering stage um

1191
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,599
what fpga is is think of it as a as a

1192
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:36,799
very high-end boutique liquid compost

1193
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,359
so you have this basically

1194
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,000
liquid nutrient that you're able to make

1195
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,159
it's like making compost the breakdown

1196
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
of compost you get that those raw

1197
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,358
materials and you can put them on plants

1198
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,358
and plants love it fpgas like this

1199
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,719
like caviar of

1200
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,719
compost and liquid form

1201
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,680
but one of the things um and and so what

1202
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,559
it is is it's going out and finding a

1203
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,000
weed

1204
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,838
um or a plant that's green all the time

1205
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the bugs leave it alone

1206
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:14,318
it it grows really quickly it grows

1207
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,920
um it's robust or grows vigorously

1208
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:21,199
it's full of beneficial biochemicals

1209
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,920
that cause it to be so strong

1210
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,759
it's also for whatever reason has

1211
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,680
figured out how to

1212
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,760
take nutrients from the soil very

1213
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,759
effectively so that it's not

1214
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,640
struggling to be nutrient dense

1215
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,318
it thrives in your area it's going to be

1216
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:44,559
different in hawaii than it is in

1217
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,920
michigan or in uh in colorado or idaho

1218
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
you know it's

1219
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,159
each place is going to have its own

1220
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,879
plan and and what you need to do to

1221
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,799
really make fpj is go out

1222
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,039
and change your vision

1223
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,680
everybody's got these blinders on these

1224
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,079
these glasses that cause you not to see

1225
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,318
the weeds that you've seen your entire

1226
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,920
life and just come to ignore

1227
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,719
you know you look at oh the pretty

1228
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,639
flowers and you don't see the

1229
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,959
um maybe if you're in california by the

1230
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,078
coast it's ice plant you don't see the

1231
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,440
ice plant

1232
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,960
or the

1233
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,280
um

1234
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,119
uh ivy or the

1235
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,720
um

1236
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,119
um

1237
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:29,039
lamb's quarter or the um amaranth or

1238
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,559
you know all these things that are weeds

1239
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,119
and we're annoyed when they show up in

1240
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,640
our yard dandelions

1241
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,599
but really that stuff is so vigorous so

1242
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,759
strong and if we harvest it and make

1243
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,400
plant food out of it we actually get the

1244
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,640
benefit of its abundant strength

1245
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,960
as a plant nutrient and it's nearly free

1246
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,118
just a little bit of sugar so free weeds

1247
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,920
and a little bit of sugar becomes

1248
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,400
um one of the best nutrients you can buy

1249
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,880
or apply to your plant and

1250
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,400
the process is pretty easy to do

1251
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,358
um one of the things you don't want to

1252
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
do is you don't want to go to the

1253
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,880
grocery store and buy a bunch of fruit

1254
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,318
and

1255
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,200
make it into

1256
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,719
stuff

1257
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,879
there are some

1258
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,239
people teaching that on the internet and

1259
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,400
um you know

1260
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,879
if it works for you it works for you you

1261
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,000
can you can mess around with the

1262
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,960
the uh

1263
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,039
the

1264
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,400
the changes people have made and i don't

1265
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,759
think there's anything wrong with that

1266
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,079
because it's still

1267
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,640
a nod of natural law it's still using

1268
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,599
some of this technology but if you think

1269
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:35,279
about it

1270
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,519
in a forest canopy or in grassland

1271
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,480
the the weeds lay down they die off they

1272
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:43,039
get digested they become plant food and

1273
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,000
we're just doing that kind of digestion

1274
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,519
process and using it as plant food

1275
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,760
that's a simple way to put it i know

1276
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,519
you're somewhat strapped on time here so

1277
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,280
i'll just hit you with a few more

1278
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,440
questions and then we'll wrap things up

1279
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,160
i do want to go over water-soluble

1280
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,599
calcium so wca can you talk to us about

1281
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:04,719
that yeah it's it's uh wca is a great

1282
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,559
tool for bringing calcium into your

1283
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,799
growing system

1284
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,040
you're using a calcium-rich material so

1285
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,119
egg shells

1286
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,960
or coral sand i like coral sand because

1287
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,280
you don't have to cook it or oyster

1288
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
shells if you use eggshells or oyster

1289
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,359
shells those were living things that

1290
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,599
have organic bonds and we have to trash

1291
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:28,480
those organic bonds to use it to get the

1292
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:31,519
calcium out of it so the cooking process

1293
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,400
destroys those organic bonds so that we

1294
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,800
can do a chemical reaction um and so the

1295
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,838
chemical reaction is a high calcium or

1296
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,640
basic material reacting with a vinegar

1297
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:45,759
or acidic material we combine those and

1298
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,838
it causes the basic or alkaline material

1299
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
to react with the acidic material and

1300
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,719
causes it to go into solution which

1301
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,558
again micronizes it and makes it so the

1302
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,239
plant can receive it through its cuticle

1303
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,880
can receive it through its cell wall on

1304
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,199
its leaves or is really easy to digest

1305
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,358
in the soil so it's just um there's a

1306
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,318
video on it super simple to do

1307
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:05,358
and

1308
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,159
it's a

1309
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:10,318
low cost way to get a very high quality

1310
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,879
calcium what we produce is called

1311
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,039
calcium acetate and it's not something

1312
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,119
you can readily buy at the store

1313
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,318
that's partially because it's not a

1314
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:24,400
patentable process it's a very simple

1315
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:27,599
diy possible process

1316
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,039
but it's also a very high quality

1317
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:33,280
nutrient for your plant so yeah wca is

1318
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,838
easy use it all the time

1319
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,440
and uh don't be afraid of giving it a

1320
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:43,920
try what's the shelf life on that um if

1321
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,400
you make it properly it lasts years um

1322
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,079
so like uh improper would be if you

1323
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,920
undercook the eggs

1324
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,160
um you have some of that organic

1325
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,838
material will get in there kind of the

1326
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,358
protein in the in the in the shell eggs

1327
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,239
wall cell walls

1328
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,159
that organic material will putrefy and

1329
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,879
rot over time and you it'll start to

1330
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,558
sting so it's about the quality that you

1331
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,280
make it with if you don't take the

1332
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,119
membrane if you don't kind of winnow off

1333
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,440
the membrane on the inside of the

1334
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,599
eggshells or

1335
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,519
or pull off the membrane before you cook

1336
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,760
it if you leave that membrane in there

1337
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,119
it's an organic material it'll degrade

1338
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,800
the shelf life and so um that's a

1339
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,280
variable depending on the quality of

1340
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,640
your process so if i make it a couple

1341
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,640
years if a newbie makes it and screws up

1342
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,118
maybe six months and then what would the

1343
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,440
recommended application rate be for for

1344
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,680
that generally we use that at one to a

1345
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,760
thousand uh so much of this these

1346
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,598
natural farming um

1347
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,280
uh nutrients are used at almost

1348
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,838
homeopathic amounts and it seems like um

1349
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,760
it's too little like more is more and

1350
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,558
people start applying extra

1351
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,920
um it's not that way in natural farming

1352
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,040
do it the way it's talked about um

1353
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,079
so like

1354
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:01,838
um

1355
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,280
we were gonna talk i don't know if we

1356
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,199
have time but we were gonna talk about

1357
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,200
maintenance solution and maintenance

1358
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,598
solution like if you're going to do one

1359
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,159
thing applied to your plants do

1360
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:16,079
maintenance solutions

1361
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:19,440
on my website i should have in the next

1362
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,720
month or so i should have my ohn and

1363
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,358
available again i have it there because

1364
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,199
it takes three months to make and people

1365
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,880
you know hear about natural farming they

1366
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,118
want to get started right away so i make

1367
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,358
that available so they don't have that

1368
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,920
three-month wait time

1369
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,279
also gonna have faa which takes about a

1370
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,680
year to make

1371
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,480
and i haven't offered that in the past

1372
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,159
but

1373
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,119
again these things that are kind of

1374
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,279
barriers to entry is part of the reason

1375
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,318
for offering those

1376
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,880
on my website but the

1377
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,960
maintenance solution is fbj

1378
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,318
oriental herbal nutrient which is like a

1379
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,720
prebiotic

1380
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,400
it's kind of plant health and then brown

1381
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,399
rice vinegar and

1382
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,200
those that small amount of nutrients

1383
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,119
applied weekly can be all you need as

1384
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:09,759
far as a foliar nutrient if you're

1385
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,318
applying like a liquid imo or a solid

1386
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,960
imo and feeding it with some

1387
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,039
bokashi or compost or food scraps and

1388
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,760
then applied maintenance solution that

1389
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:22,719
can be your entire growing protocol

1390
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,880
right there like nothing else going and

1391
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,039
it becomes cathartic simple you can

1392
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,200
spray yourself with maintenance solution

1393
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,599
a little in your mouth

1394
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,358
and it's this really

1395
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,160
wonderful natural process but we're

1396
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,400
using one to 500

1397
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,679
fermented plant juice and so ratios real

1398
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,480
quick i'm going to jump into this you

1399
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:45,039
didn't ask me but i talk about ratios in

1400
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,358
youtube it's a math problem

1401
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,960
one to a thousand means if you have a

1402
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,920
thousand water

1403
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,039
what's one one thousandth of that

1404
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,358
it's a division problem one one thousand

1405
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,000
is the amount of nutrient you put in

1406
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,119
that 1000 water so if i have

1407
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,639
a liter

1408
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:07,519
then i put 1 ml that's 1 1000 of a liter

1409
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,598
right so if i'm spraying out a liter in

1410
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,559
my little liter spray bottle on my two

1411
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:17,039
plants or my little you know garden box

1412
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:20,160
then i need 1 ml of ohn 1 to 500 would

1413
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,960
be 2 ml of fpj

1414
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,039
and then 1 to 500 vinegar would be 2 ml

1415
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,679
of vinegar into my one liter spray

1416
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,759
bottle and it's so little you know

1417
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,399
you're like how can this like

1418
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,800
20 drops of this thing do anything but

1419
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,400
watch the plants react the plants get

1420
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,559
shiny and green up and uh yeah sounds

1421
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
like it's a very easy process once you

1422
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,040
just learn the basics and put in the

1423
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,119
practice yourself so what advice do you

1424
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,480
have for those growers transitioning to

1425
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,039
k f

1426
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,400
enjoy the process you know the the

1427
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:56,079
learning the learning journey is and can

1428
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,680
be so fun

1429
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,000
and um

1430
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,919
you know instead of it being

1431
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,798
the um

1432
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,519
this

1433
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:07,039
you know rigorous recipe of

1434
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,960
you know how much

1435
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,880
pink and green stuff you're applying and

1436
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,760
salt fertilizer

1437
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,000
it can be this learning journey and

1438
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,319
it can affect kind of whole health human

1439
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,318
health

1440
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:24,318
also failure is a good teacher don't be

1441
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:27,119
afraid of the failures um they will just

1442
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:29,039
make you better at it um try and fail on

1443
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,280
a small scale you know if you're trying

1444
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,039
something new maybe don't try it on

1445
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,839
everything right off

1446
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:38,159
and really take a class if you get the

1447
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,000
opportunity to come to an in-person

1448
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,960
class um

1449
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,960
it's i've i teach online i have an

1450
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,000
online class

1451
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,358
and i believe much more in an in-person

1452
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
class because

1453
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,440
taste touch smell matters or

1454
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,280
hang out if there's somebody that's come

1455
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,599
to a class that's around you you know of

1456
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,680
somebody go hang out with them offer to

1457
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,599
buy them lunch if they'll like do some

1458
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,000
natural farming with you

1459
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,240
because that little bit of nuance that

1460
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,480
taste touch smell can really help you

1461
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,558
kind of jump start your process i think

1462
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,318
that's some really good advice

1463
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,240
so wrapping things up how can the

1464
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,679
listeners find you and what do you have

1465
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,598
upcoming in the future

1466
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:21,199
yeah um

1467
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:24,480
i have done um some podcasts obviously

1468
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:26,480
uh something that i i jump on to so um

1469
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,119
different places

1470
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,798
had some of these conversations

1471
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,240
always different

1472
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,559
but i have a youtube channel you just

1473
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:37,199
search chris trump i have a website it's

1474
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,640
just christrump.com

1475
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:43,919
and on my website i do have courses the

1476
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:46,239
online course is a bunch of video time

1477
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,680
it gets so much deeper into all the

1478
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,719
details um i am updating that this year

1479
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,960
with

1480
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,118
about double the content

1481
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,720
um so hopefully that happens this month

1482
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,119
i've been

1483
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:02,719
chipping away at it um

1484
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:05,760
and that that will always be updated um

1485
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,679
uh just added to over time um and then i

1486
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,200
do in-person classes i have one in

1487
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,558
ireland in june and then i have one in

1488
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,679
cape cod

1489
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,839
in october september late september and

1490
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,679
then one in tennessee in september so

1491
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,119
kind of east coast is getting the love

1492
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,440
this year

1493
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,480
as far as

1494
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,679
in-person classes but come on out it's a

1495
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,599
ton of fun the community aspect kind of

1496
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,838
you taking a class with people that then

1497
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,480
you're staying in contact and and the

1498
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,000
growing community of natural farmers is

1499
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,519
probably the best part i mean that's

1500
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,880
that's invaluable it'll feel like a

1501
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,199
vacation

1502
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,119
um but yeah that's that's kind of what

1503
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,798

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,240
little when it comes to natural farming

1517
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,000
as far as talking about it uh we could
