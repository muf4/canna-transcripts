1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
coming up on garden talk the very top

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
two leaves that come out and pull those

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080
off and allow that light to penetrate

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,480
down and they'll start to branch out by

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,559
themselves without that stunt period of

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
actually popping the top off

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,160
the second layer is for support the

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,920
first one is for yield i want that

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,278
canopy filled out i don't want to be

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
growing the floor

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,800
literally i'll make the top leaves of

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,719
the canopy kiss the bottom of that net

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
as soon as i bring them in i want to say

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,320
two but i'll even give it three anything

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
over a three gallon pot starts to become

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,238
wasteful in cocoa those are still

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
valuable i know they'd like to say cut

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,439
from the top but i haven't really seen

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
any difference from taking clones from

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,679
the top or the bottom i'll defoliate in

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,359
veg too if i see that it's getting too

22
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,600
thick and i want more branching i'll

23
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,439
defoliate in veg but those little silver

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
ones that you get out of beauty section

25
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,439
at like walmart or something i'm talking

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,960
about just one little snip they pop

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,960
right through that net like it's nothing

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160

about you and your growth setup i think

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,438
it's gonna be a really good episode

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,879
today i've had quite a few people ask me

111
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,959
about the scrub technique and i know

112
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,840
that's something you do very very well

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,199
so i'm excited for this one yeah me too

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,878
but before we kind of get into the

115
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,238
nitty-gritty of things can you tell us a

116
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,239
little bit about yourself and kind of

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,920
how you got into gardening

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,080
uh yes uh beast coast grower 420 the

119
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,719
main reason that i got into gardening is

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
because i'm vegan been vegan for a while

121
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,399
so it kind of made me want to go into

122
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,599
like growing my own foods which got me

123
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,679
into a lot of the the plant growing and

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
after that a friend of mine winded up

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
with cancer

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,960
and as he was recovering from the

127
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,879
chemotherapy i decided to start looking

128
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,638
up different herbs and medicinal plants

129
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,639
that would be good to help him in the

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
recovery process of the cancer and

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,400
that's how i stumbled across a lot of

132
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,799
the other plants that came along with it

133
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,959
but i've always been a nature person

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
always loved growing plants always like

135
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,560
to tap in but i would probably be called

136
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
the tree hugger

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,319
i'd be one of those guys i just

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
something about nature always called me

139
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,918
so that's what really pulled me into

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
wanting to grow that's pretty cool yeah

141
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,000
my dad just had lung cancer got

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,478
diagnosed with that and he was going

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
through radiation and chemotherapy and

144
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,159
he is doesn't smoke i mean he tried it

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,519
way back in the day he's older now he's

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
elderly

147
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,879
and

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,399
i somewhat convinced him to do it you

149
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,959
know i mentioned you know chemotherapy

150
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,879
one of the things is you get nauseous

151
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,638
sick after the fact

152
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,159
now i mentioned to him i'm like hey

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
that's one thing that cannabis helps you

154
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,639
with is the nausea it helps you go away

155
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,000
you feel better would you be willing to

156
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,079
try it he said yes now the thing is they

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
give you now with chemo a whole bunch of

158
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,758
different medication that offsets all

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
the side effects so he actually didn't

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
have any side effects from the chemo

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
which i thought was amazing it was crazy

162
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,599
wow so he never got a chance to try it

163
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,600
but cannabis kind of being you know

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
helpful on the cancer side of things in

165
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
various ways

166
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,839
you know yeah i'm glad you brought that

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
up because it is definitely helpful on

168
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,679
that avenue yes especially when it comes

169
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,439
to like appetite even because a lot of

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
people who go through that they really

171
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,879
lose their appetite so that's another

172
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,559
way to bring on the appetite i'm glad

173
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,560
medical science has gotten so good that

174
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,720
they have things that can counter the

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
effects of the radiation though yeah

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
yeah for sure and then before we started

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,918
talking you talked about how you grow a

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,120
whole variety of things i mean you're on

179
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:11,439
berries apples pears peaches plums all

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
sorts of vegetables so it's not just

181
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,038
those medicinal varieties you're growing

182
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,439
a lot of different things

183
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,279
yes heavy in a permaculture that's what

184
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,439
that's what originally pulled me was

185
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,839
people building their own food forest

186
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,600
and just giving back to nature so that

187
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,679
that called me as soon as i seen that

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
i'm like yeah i got to do this yeah

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
that's awesome

190
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,439
so are you an indoor grower outdoors do

191
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,399
you do both both both okay what's your

192
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,199
overall kind of gross style

193
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,359
um well for outdoor of course 100

194
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,600
organic i like to go right into the

195
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,479
ground it just makes life a lot easier

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,560
um on the indoor coco and then tell me a

197
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,478
little bit more about your indoor growth

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,839
setup you know what size growth space

199
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,079
are you working in what do you have for

200
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,000
lighting how's your ventilation run so

201
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,680
on and so forth okay so uh on the indoor

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,839
there's one room that is a

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
i say probably like an eight by

204
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,279
eight by like 18

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,720
roughly but i use about a four by 16 for

206
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,198
canopy space um one gallon pots of cocoa

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
on flood trays but instead of flooding

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
and draining there's a watering system

209
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,680
that sits inside of the tray loop around

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
just to get it pressurized and each tray

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,959
has its own watering system one minute a

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
day open flow water as soon as the

213
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,519
lights come on

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,319
um trellis of course uh double trellised

215
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,439
if necessary uh switched over to leds a

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,360
while back because leds are just

217
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,800
way more efficient didn't have to worry

218
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
about any heat when it came to those

219
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,439
summer runs anymore it just made life a

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,680
lot easier once i switched over to leds

221
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,399
so i try to keep it as simple as

222
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,240
possible 12 plants per tray one gallon

223
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,758
pots of cocoa open flow watering system

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
one minute a day

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,280
two minutes in the middle of flowers

226
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,038
sometimes if necessary because sometimes

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
around week four week five they'll tend

228
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,120
to drink a little bit more so that's

229
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,959
when i'll up the watering if necessary

230
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,038
but on open flow people got to remember

231
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,799
that it's it's a lot more water coming

232
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,959
out than those pressure regulated ones

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,439
that's given 0.3

234
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,519
whatever per hour so since mine is open

235
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,038
flow one minute is more than enough it

236
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,799
sounds like when you're working with a

237
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,399
large amount of plants this probably

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
much easier for you to have that hooked

239
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,959
up to automated systems like that yes

240
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
yes especially once you put the trellis

241
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,319
nets on because you can't really reach

242
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
in with a wand or anything in water it

243
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,760
just makes everything a hundred times

244
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,360
more difficult so much easier to get

245
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,360
them on that watering system early so

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
when the nets is set you're pretty much

247
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
free got it yeah that's a question i'm

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
going to ask you later on we'll get

249
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,799
deeper into it once we get into scrugg i

250
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,958
gotta ask do you typically grow from

251
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,399
seed or are you starting from clone most

252
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,399
of the time

253
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,200
uh most of the time the room will be

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,120
filled predominantly with clones but i

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
saved one tray and one of the rooms

256
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,278
specifically just for final hunting i've

257
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,958
always pheno hunted i pop new seeds as

258
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,799
soon as i'm done with the final hunt i'm

259
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,399
always looking for something new and i

260
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,479
want something of my own like it's good

261
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
to acquire the cuts that are available

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
to get those keeper cuts that other

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,000
people sourced out but sometimes i just

264
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
want my own fino and i might not like

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
the pheno that they chose to keep and

266
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,919
run with so i'd rather hunt through it

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
myself and see what i can find so

268
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,120
sometimes i'm starting from seed but

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,839
it's never going to be a full run from

270
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
seed predominantly the room will be uh

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
of the keeper stock of clones that i've

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,240
had okay yeah that was actually a viewer

273
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,360
question wanted to know about seed

274
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
versus clone that's one thing i don't

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
really ask the viewers much it's like

276
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,439
that's a great question might as well

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
start asking them because you know it

278
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
does make a difference in in some ways

279
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,679
it does some people say that seeds are

280
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
more vigorous than uh than the clones

281
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,278
are but it

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,879
it really comes down to technique what

283
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,958
do you what are you doing it for are you

284
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,958
just hunting for personal use is it just

285
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,639
something that you want to do or are you

286
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,399
involved in the industry do you have the

287
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,039
actual space to be able to do bigger

288
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,120
hunts so since i don't want to dedicate

289
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,039
a lot of space to hunting i just got one

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,639
four by four tray in the room that's

291
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,399
right by the door so you can monitor it

292
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,958
for any herms or anything as soon as you

293
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,839
walk in and that's normally the trade

294
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,958
that i'll dedicate to fino hunts oh okay

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,720
that's my

296
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,078
good way of going about doing it

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,079
okay so now that we have some of the

298
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,559
basics out of the way let's kind of dive

299
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,000
a little bit into plant training and

300
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,359
then we'll get into like the scrub

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,679
techniques so

302
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,600
what type of plant training do you

303
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,519
typically do are you doing topping any

304
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,399
low stress training super cropping

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
filming

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,879
what do you typically do um well from

307
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,799
the beginning water and solo cups as

308
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,120
soon as they start getting a bit tall i

309
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,719
do what what i label as the grandmaster

310
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,879
level topping technique where you just

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,639
take the very top two leaves that come

312
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,399
out and pull those off and allow that

313
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,838
light to penetrate down and they'll

314
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,320
start to branch out by themselves

315
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
without that stunt period of actually

316
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,480
popping the top off so they'll never

317
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,159
stop growing they'll just focus more on

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
branching from that point out so from

319
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,679
the moment they're in solo cups and i

320
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,159
see them start to go for that stretch i

321
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,159
start to periodically pull those top two

322
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,078
leaves off everything until you get that

323
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,679
wine glass shape that you're looking for

324
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,679
some people train for that some people

325
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,439
top for that but i don't like to keep to

326
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,120
stunt the plants and keep them short

327
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
they'll grow they'll grow wide enough

328
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
just by simply pulling those top two

329
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,560
leaves off now when it comes to plant

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
training

331
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,119
uh

332
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
they normally don't really get any

333
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,240
training until they get moved into the

334
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,240
flower room from from veg they're

335
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
compacted together because my veg space

336
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,759
is smaller than my flower space so i

337
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,760
have to compact them together and veg

338
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,759
and they kind of grow straight up minus

339
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,919
me pulling those top leaves but as soon

340
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,319
as they get into the flower room they

341
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,919
get one week of veg before they get

342
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,079
flipped and during that week is when the

343
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,759
net goes on and i start to fold them out

344
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,359
right then and there so i'll pull

345
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,039
everything from the bottoms that i feel

346
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,039
don't need to be there get them laid

347
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,199
under that net immediately and give them

348
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,199
a week to really fill that net out

349
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
before flip and then by that time you

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,959
could just let them go set that second

351
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,000
layer a net and they'll just grow right

352
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,599
into it

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
you won't have to really train into that

354
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
second layer let's talk about the scrub

355
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
technique in a little bit more detail so

356
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,839
net let's start with this that how big

357
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
of a net do you use i know you said you

358
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,480
were in a four foot your canopy was four

359
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
feet by 16 feet so you just run a net

360
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,920
all the way down or what all the way

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,320
down so they have these nets that you

362
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,799
can buy that come on like a like a spool

363
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,560
almost like a big like yarn thread thing

364
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,278
they come on a huge one and you could

365
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:32,159
just pull them out so yeah we uh in that

366
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,278
room 16 feet and some of the other rooms

367
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,719
there's 25 feet of trellis netting and

368
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,639
we just hook them up and get those

369
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,759
things set right away i was looking to

370
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,759
get uh those metal poles that you can uh

371
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,439
screw into the ground that can hold them

372
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,600
because one thing you'll notice is if

373
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
you're using pvc or something as a setup

374
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,879
for your trellis netting they they have

375
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,159
a tendency to bow in and i i don't like

376
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,759
having to deal with that so you got to

377
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,679
find a strong enough structure to be

378
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,360
able to attach the trellis too so you

379
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,958
don't have to worry about that happening

380
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
so you can get the full use out of the

381
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,559
trellis what are you attaching to the

382
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,359
trellis to now and how are you attaching

383
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,039
it

384
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,680
uh we i use screws and i i screwed two

385
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,159
by fours into each corner of where each

386
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,879
tray would be four feet wide on on both

387
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,000
ends and on one end i actually had to

388
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,000
brace it and actually make like a

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,679
how can i describe it it's like a two by

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,120
four that kind of locks on in each round

391
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,239
i could just unscrew it and pull it

392
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
right off

393
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,959
but that's what i have to use on the

394
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,759
other end because it doesn't have really

395
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,319
anything to brace to so just uh regular

396
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,720
screws hook them into the two by fours

397
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
and pulling that straight across

398
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
i try to do this before the plants get

399
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
too tall though because it gets more

400
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,919
hectic the bigger you let the plants get

401
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
because then you really got to start

402
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,120
weaving them through so you almost want

403
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
to get it to where they're just kissing

404
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,919
the bottom of the net

405
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
and then after that week they'll just

406
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,039
start to grow into it and all you got to

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
do is just move them out as they get

408
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,480
through those nets okay the screwing

409
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,800
into the board is interesting when i did

410
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
this grug when i i've done it a handful

411
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,599
of times probably uh

412
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,278
maybe a dozen times at the most and i

413
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
usually do it in grow tents

414
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,838
so what i usually use is zip ties and

415
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,679
i'll zip tie it to the side of the grow

416
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,399
tent poles so that's kind of another way

417
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,759
to go about it if any listeners are

418
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,679
wondering how to do it within a grow

419
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,439
tent and in that system you got

420
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,198
something more stable because that tent

421
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,959
is braced on each corner so you don't

422
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,039
have to worry about the tent blowing in

423
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,239
on you because it is built the way that

424
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,759
it's built so that's what i'm saying

425
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
when people gotta lay the net make sure

426
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,759
that you got something sturdy enough

427
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,519
that when you pull that net tight it

428
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,519
stays tight it doesn't wind up blowing

429
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,759
in the structure that you got for it

430
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
really good point so for the actual net

431
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,559
told you we're gonna get deep on this

432
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,958
one

433
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,879
is there a particular brand i don't know

434
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,319
if you mentioned the brand and you're

435
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,679
well from what you were explaining in

436
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,600
the type of net is it the polypropylene

437
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,159
type nets that you've got polyester

438
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
you've got nylon polypropylene you've

439
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,319
got chicken wire so there are different

440
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,440
options

441
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,240
polypropylene the plastic type uh no i'm

442
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,560
using the nylons nylon okay so it is

443
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
stretchy you you like the stretchyness

444
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,638
yes

445
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,239
yes

446
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
compared to the plastic ones and the

447
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
plastic i don't i don't know what made

448
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
me stick with the nylon ones but

449
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,879
normally it's the nylon ones because

450
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,519
they come on the big spool they're just

451
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,439
easy to hook on roll it down hook it to

452
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
the other side cut it and you're good to

453
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,880
go yeah yeah i would think the

454
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,479
stretchiness would be beneficial i mean

455
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,240
it's been beneficial for me i know a lot

456
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,079
of people use this chicken wire and

457
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,519
that's more a fixed and you're really

458
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,359
not going to have to be able to bend it

459
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,480
at all have you used chicken wire at all

460
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
or no

461
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,440
i was also worried about if that wire

462
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,440
ever got wet or anything what what would

463
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,959
happen with it leaning on the stems like

464
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
i try to keep

465
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,958
wiring metal kind of away from the

466
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,919
plants because i i'm not saying it will

467
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,319
cause any issues but the the less risk

468
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,319
the better so i i try to stay away from

469
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
those kind of things

470
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
i know most people that are using those

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,079
they they reuse them right yeah yeah

472
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
they'll reuse them i got a fear of

473
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,159
reusing stuff like that because if it's

474
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
ever a problem powdery mildew bugs

475
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,360
anything

476
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,879
you you just inviting it right back into

477
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,879
each round every time that you do that

478
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,720
so with the nylon ones it's easy to just

479
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,720
pull them off after each round toss them

480
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,320
pull the next one on the next one good

481
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,440
point now on the trellis net i know

482
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
there are so many different ones out

483
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,279
there but the

484
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,120
trail set holes right the holes

485
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,039
are different sizes you know i think

486
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,198
there's three inches by three inches

487
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,759
four inches by four inches what size you

488
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,679
typically use the three and a half inch

489
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,440
uh three and a half inch i tried the

490
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,000
fives i tried everything else i feel

491
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,600
like the fives are more for support so

492
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
if i was going to use like the five inch

493
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
squares i would do that on a second

494
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,799
layer of net where i'm not exactly

495
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
trying to weave anything into place or

496
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,958
use it to fill out the canopy but when

497
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
it's time to to fill out the canopy i

498
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,239
want those three and a half inch square

499
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,319
so that way i can make sure that i got a

500
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,399
head in every square and that the canopy

501
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,800
is full but when you're using the five

502
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
inch ones it's going to be multiple tops

503
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,758
in each one and hopefully you can even

504
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
get it filled if you need to pull a

505
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,519
branch over it doesn't really snag the

506
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
right way that you want it to because

507
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,519
the squares are so big so on the first

508
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
layer of net it's always three and a

509
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,918
half inch but if i if i can't find any

510
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
more i don't mind using the five inch

511
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
squares on the second layer where it's

512
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
just more for support than it is for

513
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
actually weaving them through to fill

514
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,558
out the canopy

515
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,720
you bring up a great point with the

516
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,200
support side of things that's one thing

517
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,880
i was going to mention at some point is

518
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
you know some people use the trellis and

519
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
scrock technique because they want to

520
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,480
maximize yield other people they just

521
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,519
want it for plant support

522
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,200
which way do you do both for support and

523
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,038
yield or what do you kind of aim for

524
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
using the second layer is for support

525
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,879
the first one is for yield i want that

526
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,199
canopy filled out i don't want to be

527
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
growing the floor i don't want any light

528
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
hitting that floor if i could prevent it

529
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,079
because anything underneath that first

530
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
layer of net is getting lolly popped off

531
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,599
anyway so i don't i don't want any light

532
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,519
penetrating through there i just want a

533
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,519
full canopy from that first layer and

534
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,839
that up through that second one

535
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,759
so it's for yield for me now granted the

536
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,119
second layer is more for support because

537
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,759
you don't want them flopping over after

538
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,079
they get big but that that first layer

539
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,359
is strictly yield yield driven makes

540
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,798
sense and then you bring up a great

541
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,558
point just one echo what you said before

542
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,798
is the larger the square it seems like

543
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,558
it's the harder it is to kind of

544
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,240
manipulate the plan and keep plants

545
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,558
tucked under because the squares are so

546
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,519
big and yes you've got multiple shoots

547
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,918
coming out one square and

548
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,558
so yeah i mean i had this

549
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,320
i had this nylon one where it stretched

550
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,240
and as it stretched it to the growth

551
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,279
tent the holes would get bigger you know

552
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
what i mean so it just made it more

553
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,279
difficult yes i feel like

554
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
the size of squares i feel like is

555
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,319
pretty important

556
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,798
yes they start off as fives but once

557
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,319
they start to stretch they wind up even

558
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,240
bigger and if you're growing shorter

559
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,319
squatter plants like the strain

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,558
dependent um

561
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,079
those fives will really hurt you because

562
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,440
the shorter and squatter they are the

563
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,839
more you're going to want to train them

564
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
out to really get that penetration into

565
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,159
the inside and you cannot do that with

566
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,839
the fives gotcha now how many plants are

567
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
you putting per

568
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,279
i was going to say square foot but

569
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,519
really i mean you're

570
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,279
so maybe like a four foot by four foot

571
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,119
area how many plants do you typically

572
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:20,879
have in that like under the net 12 to 16

573
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,879
per 4x4 really strain dependent if i'm

574
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,039
doing something like ice cream cake i

575
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,440
would use 12 because they stretch about

576
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,720
200 percent once they hit flour so i

577
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,400
don't want to

578
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,319
load that in too heavy because then the

579
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
canopy would be two-packed now if i'm

580
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,319
running something that's a little less

581
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,839
vigorous i'll do 16 to make up for the

582
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,359
fact that during that stretch it's not

583
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,038
going to give me the same thing and

584
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,038
it'll work better to fill the canopy out

585
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,038
if i do 16

586
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,079
of that strain versus 12 of another

587
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,599
strain so 12 to 16 give or take and i

588
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,839
know you said you're in one gallon

589
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,000
containers small you're on an auto

590
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,678
watering system so that's very helpful

591
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,519
there to keep everything saturated or

592
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
else if you're not on an auto watering

593
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,440
system it's probably you know it can dry

594
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,239
out super quick yes and then you do a

595
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,798
lot more labor there and with the more

596
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,038
the higher plant count versus if you did

597
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,798
just do four plants for example right

598
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,720
you're looking at a shorter veg time too

599
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,639
so that's uh yes that's you're filling

600
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
up that space a lot quicker than you

601
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,038
would with less plants yes that was

602
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,440
worth pointing out there that was the

603
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,279
goal and when you're using cocoa i think

604
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,038
anything over

605
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,879
i want to say two but i'll even give it

606
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,960
three anything over a three gallon pot

607
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,919
starts to become wasteful in cocoa

608
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
gotcha

609
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,880
and so okay so you've got your 12 plants

610
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,320
roughly in that space i actually have

611
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
four four feet by 16 feet now what point

612
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,798
do you

613
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,479
you touched on this earlier i believe

614
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,960
what point you put up that first layer

615
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,360
of trellis that and then what is the

616
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,480
distance between the grow pod

617
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,479
and the net

618
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
it kind of depends on how big the plants

619
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,759
are when they go into the room

620
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,440
but usually i'll set that first net

621
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,279
literally i'll make the top leaves of

622
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
the canopy kiss the bottom of that net

623
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,678
as soon as i bring them in so i'll bring

624
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,279
the plants in and even if i need to i'll

625
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,880
cut them back just to make everything

626
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,480
even so if there's a couple branches

627
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,400
that are just reaching out on top of

628
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,720
everything else i'll just cut those

629
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,559
clean off just to even out the canopy

630
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,480
and i'll set the net right to the very

631
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:21,359
very top of it so it's usually about

632
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,759
maybe 18 inches from from pot to where

633
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,599
the first layer of trellis netting is

634
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,599
i typically do 18 inches too that's

635
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,519
that's about right you know might be 20

636
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,119
inches of time depending on plant growth

637
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,119
like you mentioned that's going to be a

638
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,479
determinant of it as well

639
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,000
yes so

640
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,319
when do you start

641
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,960
actually weaving the plants too now you

642
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,480
mentioned that you don't do any topping

643
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
okay traditional thing i mean i've read

644
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,279
some articles before we even started

645
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,879
talking here just kind of refresh my

646
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,480
memories and come up with some questions

647
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,159
traditional way is to top in between the

648
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,759
third and fifth notes so either third

649
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
note fourth note the fifth note and

650
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,480
allowing those lower branches to kind of

651
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
come up into the net and spread out now

652
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440
you don't do that you do that other

653
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,918
technique that you mentioned and that

654
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,600
allows to grow the plants

655
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,360
so at what point are you kind of weaving

656
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,359
you said you added it in you've got the

657
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,639
net going right away so pretty much

658
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,558
right away is when you're starting to

659
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,038
weave as the plants are just growing or

660
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,558
what within that first week of them

661
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,558
being in the flower room even though

662
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,079
that first week is still veg they're in

663
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,519
the flower room but they're going to veg

664
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,279
for a week in that flower room and that

665
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,679
week is more than enough because i set

666
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,359
the net just above them so within that

667
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,759
first week of growth because there's way

668
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,519
more light now there's uh co2 now

669
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,960
there's so many other things now that

670
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,960
they're going to skyrocket the second

671
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
you get them into that that bigger room

672
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,880
so within that first week i'll have that

673
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,798
net fully filled out because i didn't

674
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,559
set it so high above where the plants

675
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,960
were that i have to wait for too much

676
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,879
growth any growth that comes in past the

677
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,319
point when they first get in there has

678
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
to get weaved through or it's gonna wind

679
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,558
up just being too tall and overshadowing

680
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,319
things in the corners

681
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,079
i try to keep the canopy as even as

682
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,918
possible like when i'm when i'm done

683
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,839
with a round i want to just be able to

684
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,000
scoop down and look at eye level and be

685
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,119
able to just see flat straight across if

686
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
if i can

687
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,879
yeah i know that is the goal for the

688
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,038
even canopy for scrub technique you know

689
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
using the trellis net does help a lot of

690
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,519
people call it the scrug net by the way

691
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,360
so same yes

692
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,720
it definitely helps keep that even

693
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,519
canopy

694
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
now

695
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,119
some folks what they'll do is you know

696
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
they let their plants grow up and then

697
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,319
they'll do a

698
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,679
lollipopping right they're removed to

699
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,639
lower growth

700
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,759
do you

701
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
do that

702
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,440
before your plants come into the net or

703
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,038
do you wait until a certain point that

704
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,880
the plants grow and then you'll do the

705
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,879
lollipopping

706
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,000
what i do is i wait for that week of veg

707
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
to be over

708
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,359
so once i bring them into that flower

709
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,439
room give them that week of veg see

710
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,359
exactly which branches will make it

711
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,120
through and which ones won't because

712
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,879
some branches i still won't pull off

713
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,639
even after that week of veg because i

714
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
know during the first three weeks of

715
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,000
stretch those will still make it so it's

716
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,599
kind of it's kind of it might hurt you

717
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,359
in the long run to pull some of those

718
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
off too early because they could have

719
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,798
winded up making it through and those

720
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,720
would have been great secondaries right

721
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,000
there and i i don't want to cut those

722
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
off i want to see what's going to make

723
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
it and what's not now granted there are

724
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
going to be some things that clean are

725
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,319
just not going to make it i'll take

726
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,079
those off before they even make it into

727
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,918
the flower room but there's some that

728
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,079
i'll leave and i'll just monitor for a

729
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,759
while until about week to a flower and

730
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,038
then if i know by then that you're not

731
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,400
going to make it i'll lollipop

732
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,000
everything that i know isn't going to

733
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
make it when running these kind of

734
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
setups you got to constantly have a

735
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,000
decent amount of clones ready to go

736
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,840
every single time so instead of pulling

737
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,319
those bottom ones off just a lollipop

738
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,240
and throw them out it'll be good to

739
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,839
that's where you can get a boatload of

740
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
clones from right from those bottoms

741
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,278
that you normally would have threw away

742
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,278
those those are still valuable i know

743
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,798
they like to say cut from the top but i

744
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,880
haven't really seen any difference from

745
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,558
taking clones from the top or the bottom

746
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,240
that's an efficient way to go about that

747
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,440
instead just pruning those and either

748
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,200
throwing away or throwing them in your

749
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
compost pile actually using them as

750
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
clones

751
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,000
now one more thing with the lollipopping

752
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,278
generally speaking some folks what they

753
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,519
do is they'll do

754
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,759
you know you mentioned about 18 inches

755
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,119
to the net from the pot

756
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,960
some people take

757
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,359
they'll use that as their guide and they

758
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,038
lollipop everything below that is that

759
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,558
what you do or do you

760
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,839
do more or less

761
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,918
uh

762
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,918
well since i uh

763
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
eventually once i got into it i started

764
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,038
to learn more about leaf stripping so it

765
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,798
really depends on how tall the plant get

766
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,319
will determine how much i pull off at

767
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,759
the bottom because i know once i leave

768
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,278
strip a lot of that light is going to be

769
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,200
able to penetrate now and things that

770
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,839
wouldn't have been valuable before now

771
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,640
have the opportunity of being valuable

772
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,158
so it once i leave strip i can kind of

773
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,240
get a good idea and that's normally

774
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,360
around like week two is when i start the

775
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,200
leaf stripping we too flower so once i

776
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,359
see what's going to make it and what's

777
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,278
not and what will be valuable and what

778
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,199
won't get any light no matter what

779
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,880
that's when i'll know what to exactly

780
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,798
pull off i don't like to pull anything

781
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,240
off before then because i know after the

782
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:59,918
leaf strip i'm going to expose a whole

783
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,759
bunch of branches on those bottoms to

784
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
light that they wouldn't have had prior

785
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,000
to that leaf strip so i have to kind of

786
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840
wait to see how it plays out from there

787
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,919
and again it's strain dependent because

788
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,918
some strains all the branches stretch

789
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,600
when they hit flower and some strangers

790
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,038
mainly just the top ones that'll stretch

791
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,959
when they hit flowers so it kind of

792
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,798
comes down to what strain i'm running

793
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,440
will go based on what technique that i'm

794
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,960
gonna have to do and in some instances

795
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,640
yes everything from underneath that

796
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
first layer and that is gone because

797
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,400
it's stretched so far above it that

798
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
nothing down there is going to get no

799
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,159
light no matter how much leaf stripping

800
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,000
that i wind up doing so in some cases

801
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,840
jeff that is my god that first layer in

802
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,599
that anything underneath it under most

803
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,879
circumstances is gone

804
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,678
you bring up some really good points

805
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,480
there

806
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,798
so you mentioned when you start weaving

807
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,400
the plants underneath the trellis when

808
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,558
do you stop

809
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,480
doing the weaving and kind of let them

810
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,399
grow vertical from there

811
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,720
when i can't when i can't contain it

812
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,320
anymore when i come into the room and

813
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,640
there's so much growth after they've

814
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,399
been flipped into flower that no matter

815
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,799
what i would have to almost break a

816
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
branch in order to move it anywhere else

817
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,558
that's when i just have to let it go i

818
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,400
can't i can't really do much past that

819
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,158
point and most of the times all the

820
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,919
squares are filled in by then there's

821
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,880
really nowhere to put them past that

822
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,240
point once they flip in the flower so

823
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
worst come the worse if they start

824
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,000
getting too tall i can pull a branch

825
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,519
over through that second layer of neck

826
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,038
so i don't have to let it shoot straight

827
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,038
up i could kind of pull it off to the

828
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,798
side or something like that but i

829
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,079
normally stop as soon as i hit flower

830
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,158
because you just can't contain it

831
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,240
anymore there's so much growth going on

832
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,640
each day that i would have to pull the

833
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,640
branch back down and then over and now

834
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,159
i'm risking breaking branches and having

835
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,320
to move around and break other branches

836
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,039
from other plants i just i i don't like

837
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,398
to

838
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,319
i don't like to mess with them like that

839
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,319
i've learned my lesson from doing that

840
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,119
broke a lot of branches so basically

841
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,519
you're

842
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,199
correcting from wrong you're filling up

843
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,960
that first net

844
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,159
then flipping the flower

845
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,679
yes

846
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,440
okay and then you're kind of letting

847
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,559
them grow upwards and if you can

848
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,919
continue to tuck down you will

849
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,000
but for the most part you're kind of

850
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,840
letting him grow upwards and at some

851
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,119
point you're adding in a second layer of

852
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,798
trellis more for support right yes what

853
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,479
point you typically find that you're

854
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,480
adding in that second layer is it within

855
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,558
the first three weeks of that stretch

856
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,038
period first two weeks of flower or when

857
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,798
i already have the level set because

858
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,240
once you do round after round after

859
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,679
round you know where you're gonna flip

860
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,919
you know where they're pretty much gonna

861
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,759
end so i already have

862
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
two layers of hooks for that second

863
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,599
layer of net depending on how tall the

864
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,038
plant gets i have one layer if they're

865
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,879
going to stay a little bit more squat

866
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,319
but i got a second layer just in case

867
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
for those really tall ones because so

868
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,918
sometimes there's a huge gap in between

869
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,079
the first and second layer or net and

870
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,480
sometimes not so big but i have those

871
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,639
hooks already set in in the room so as

872
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
soon as i'm re i usually

873
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,759
since i know what strain i'm already

874
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
going to be running when i lay the first

875
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,679
net i'll lay the second one right away i

876
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,519
won't even have to wait for it and then

877
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,600
what's the distance between the first

878
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,480
net and the second net

879
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,038
probably about another 18 inches 18 20

880
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,319
inches roughly depending on the strain

881
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,119
because if i'm running something like

882
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,879
poly shore or ice cream cake

883
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,439
as soon as they hit flower they're

884
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,960
shooting for the moon like so

885
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
on strains like that it's going to be a

886
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
little bit bigger of a gap in between

887
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,278
the the canopy because they just go so

888
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,439
crazy if i set it lower i would wind up

889
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,000
having to put a third layer of trellis

890
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,519
and i don't like three layers i don't

891
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,798
like

892
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,480
yeah they can grow super quick and one

893
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,278
of the techniques that i do and i'm sure

894
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,440
if you do it at all is as i find shoots

895
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,200
are kind of outgrowing other shoots is

896
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,640
super cropping technique i don't know if

897
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,240
you do that at all or i guess my

898
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,320
question is how do you manage when some

899
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,599
of these plants are outgrowing others or

900
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,319
some of the branches are outgrowing

901
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,079
others within that same net usually i'll

902
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,918
just try to pull them out the way try to

903
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,599
get them over to the to the corners to

904
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
allow that light to get into the middles

905
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,439
and over to those other corners but

906
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,798
worst come to worst i will super crop

907
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,759
them that's that's when you pinch them

908
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,000
and let them fall over right

909
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,558
i have had to do that a couple of times

910
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
actually because they'll some some

911
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,000
plants just go for the gusto

912
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,759
they don't want to share no space with

913
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
nobody else around them so sometimes yes

914
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,519
i will have to go in and pinch them and

915
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,959
super crop them

916
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,558
sometimes i'm really scared to do it

917
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,558
because i've broken a lot of branches

918
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,319
like that but there's a technique to it

919
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,240
you got to be gentle you got to be soft

920
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,480
you can't go in there on your iron man

921
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,679
hear me roar you got

922
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,278
you got to kind of give them a nice

923
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,759
pinch and let them fall over naturally

924
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,839
so yes i have had the super crop before

925
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,679
and if necessary i'll do it as often as

926
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,079
i need to on any of the branches that

927
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,559
that needed gotcha yeah i actually went

928
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,558
so far one time to um this was kind of a

929
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,879
mistake things that i deem as a mistake

930
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,480
i still got a yield out of it but i let

931
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,278
the plant grow all the way up into the

932
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,120
net

933
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,440
and then flipped a flower and i

934
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,199
continued to tuck under that first net

935
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,798
it wasn't completely full so i was able

936
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,278
to still kind of tuck

937
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,720
continue to tuck added that second layer

938
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,079
in order to control the height i

939
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,159
actually topped

940
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,079
the plants at that point i know it's a

941
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,159
huge no-no to top the plants in front

942
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,439
but it totally yeah it was in the first

943
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,640
three weeks right so i think it was like

944
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,399
day seven and i topped the plants and

945
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,480
unfortunately it continued to stretch

946
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,558
for you know roughly another 10 to 14

947
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,558
days or something like that but the top

948
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,200
plant the shoots weren't really

949
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,038
really that big so like it wasn't there

950
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,840
wasn't buds on those branches and it was

951
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,158
just kind of a mistake there so yes i

952
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,599
know going forward i'm not gonna do any

953
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
topping i thought it might have been

954
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,719
beneficial i thought topping there might

955
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
have actually helped some of the lowers

956
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,079
on the other end fill up the remaining

957
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,080
part of the net

958
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,439
and i think it did but overall i don't

959
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,439
think it was it was worth it on that

960
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,640
avenue so yeah that's the reason that

961
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,519
worse come to worse i'll chop all taller

962
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,440
branches off a week before they make it

963
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,519
into that flower room for that last week

964
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
of edge before they flip that way i can

965
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,440
get the canopy as even as possible at

966
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,319
that point and anything else that's

967
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,240
coming in will roughly be on the same

968
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,038
wavelength as the rest of them because

969
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,038
if not man like you said you you'll wind

970
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,200
up needing to either top or do massive

971
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,119
super cropping later on in flower and i

972
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,720
try to leave the plants alone as much as

973
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,639
possible once they're in flower i don't

974
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,558
really like to bother them i like them

975
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,320
to let them focus on the development

976
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,918
that they're focused on at that point

977
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,439
that's a really good way to go about it

978
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,960
for sure that's i think is going to

979
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360
actually help you know make things more

980
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,240
efficient you can help maximize yield do

981
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,599
you have any tips for maximizing the

982
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,839
scrog net i mean you already kind of

983
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,079
mentioned a couple things here and there

984
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,480
right how you run more additional plants

985
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,079
i'm sure that helps felt the growth the

986
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,558
scrug net do you have any other tips for

987
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,839
kind of how to maximize that crop net or

988
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,158
fill it up

989
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,558
either as quickly as possible or how to

990
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,559
maybe maneuver them so they're filled up

991
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,398
i'll say don't

992
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,558
don't rely on the fact that during

993
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,439
stretch that they're gonna fill that net

994
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,918
out

995
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,919
because sometimes just that main branch

996
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,399
will shoot straight up and you'll still

997
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,480
have gaps in the canopy so before you

998
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,719
flip it is good to give them just that

999
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,319
one week of veg underneath that net and

1000
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
if you see that a week is going to be

1001
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,278
too much

1002
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,199
shave it down to four or five days uh

1003
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,119
knock a day or two off of it if you see

1004
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,278
like okay the canopy is exactly where i

1005
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,199
want it right now it's fully filled up

1006
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,798
the plants have already turned back up

1007
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,278
and and they're they're looking back at

1008
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,679
the at the light everything's good go

1009
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:23,278
ahead and flip but make sure that the

1010
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,360
net is pretty much filled out before you

1011
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,119
even flip don't try to rely on that

1012
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,199
stretch darn flip to fill the rest of

1013
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,879
that net out the stems get thicker they

1014
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,880
get a little bit more woody they get

1015
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,360
harder to manipulate unless you're using

1016
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,159
silica and stuff like that but to avoid

1017
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,719
doing any of that just have them pretty

1018
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,159
much ready before you even

1019
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
flip them

1020
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,039
yeah have them pretty much ready before

1021
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,798
you even get ready to flip them fill

1022
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,879
that net out as much as possible ahead

1023
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,879
of time even if you're using less plants

1024
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,960
that are bigger just make sure that you

1025
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,440
fill it out as much as possible that's

1026
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,880
good advice for sure now are you doing

1027
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,120
any some folks what they'll do is

1028
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,760
defoliation so they will let their

1029
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,119
plants grow up into the scrog or

1030
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,919
they'll basically let the vegetarian

1031
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,078
plants out try to fill up all the

1032
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,679
squares right then they'll let their

1033
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,839
plants grow a little bit more then

1034
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,918
they'll do a defoliation at some point

1035
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,599
within the first three weeks of the

1036
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,598
stretching phase do you do anything like

1037
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,960
that at all did you defoliate at all if

1038
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,079
so when

1039
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,320
yes but uh from what i've noticed

1040
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
the big defoliations like the the

1041
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,760
massive ones where you go in and just

1042
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,879
pull all of the leaves off the plant at

1043
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,440
week three

1044
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,519
i i didn't see it as

1045
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,838
i didn't see it as necessary from doing

1046
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,079
it after doing it a couple of times i

1047
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,320
realized that if i just periodically

1048
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,399
take a couple of handfuls of leaves out

1049
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,000
of the room each day that i'm in there

1050
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,239
by the time that i make it to the end of

1051
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,679
flower i'm achieving the same results

1052
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,439
the only difference is the plants don't

1053
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,119
have to take the same amount of shock

1054
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,878
they still have those leaves to store

1055
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,399
energy they still got those leaves to be

1056
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,398
able to do anything else that they need

1057
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,118
to do with them so in the meantime i'm

1058
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,799
really just pulling off the big gigantic

1059
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,640
leaves on the top that are blocking any

1060
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
light from getting into the canopy but

1061
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,559
then later on once those leaves aren't

1062
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,480
growing back anymore i'll start to go

1063
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,920
through the mids and to the bottom

1064
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,920
sections of the plant and pull a little

1065
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,358
bit more here and there then by the time

1066
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,800
i make it to the end of flower and i

1067
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,400
have to cut them down there's not a

1068
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,000
bunch of leaf material to have to go

1069
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,519
through because some people harvest and

1070
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,159
then they'll go through and cut all the

1071
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,920
the water leaves off afterwards i i like

1072
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,679
to already have that done by the time i

1073
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,280
make it to the end and save yourself the

1074
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,919
trouble of doing it all in one shot

1075
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,440
because if you defoliate at day 21 and

1076
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,200
you pull all of the leaves off by the

1077
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,400
time you hit day 42 you got to do it

1078
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,879
again

1079
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,880
so i i figured why do it twice when i

1080
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,640
could just periodically pull leaves here

1081
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,358
and there the plants don't experience as

1082
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,199
much stress and then by the end of the

1083
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,880
round i achieved the same result as

1084
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,039
people who had to do the two massive

1085
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
ones i don't sometimes i'm limited on

1086
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,920
time and i don't have time to be in

1087
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
there four or five hours doing those

1088
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,440
leaf strips but i got an hour to be in

1089
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,440
there pulling off a lot of those big

1090
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,240
leaves that are blocking the canopy so i

1091
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,400
do defoliate but to an extent and i even

1092
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,319
defoliate in veg and that's how i get

1093
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,240
the structure that i want out of the

1094
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,559
plant before i even get it in the flower

1095
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
so i'll defoliate in veg too if i see

1096
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,799
that it's getting too thick and i want

1097
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,959
more branching i'll defoliate in veg so

1098
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,760
you're continuing to pluck off leaves as

1099
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,039
you see fit you know all through really

1100
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,320
got it there's some people out there

1101
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,800
that say that

1102
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,039
if you continue to pluck off leaves

1103
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,079
frequently like daily every couple days

1104
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,400
and you're plucking off leaves and

1105
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
you're stressing out to the plant to the

1106
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,838
point where it become a hermaphrodite

1107
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
and that's true or do you think it's bro

1108
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,119
science

1109
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,039
bro science i've never had that happen

1110
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,200
to you never had that happen to me i

1111
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,759
think you'd be more at risk

1112
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,319
by defoliating all at once because it's

1113
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,160
a huge shock imagine just having to take

1114
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
your sweater off compared to getting

1115
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,960
fully naked which one is more of a shock

1116
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,559
to you

1117
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,079
the the more of a shock is having to get

1118
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,320
rid of everything than just having to

1119
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,320
lose one thing here periodically at a

1120
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,599
time so i think you're you're risking

1121
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,440
the hermaphrodite trait more when you do

1122
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,359
larger things that'll stress them out

1123
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,119
more i don't think they notice a leaf or

1124
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,199
two missing here and there because even

1125
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,480
in nature uh maybe a deer will come

1126
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,319
through and eat a leaf or maybe a

1127
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,800
grasshopper nibble on the leaf so

1128
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,880
they're not immune to losing a leaf here

1129
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
and there the leaves died they'd suck

1130
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
the nitrogen out of them they fall off

1131
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,119
that that's more of a natural process

1132
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,879
than one day a plant just wakes up at

1133
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,400
all of its leaves are gone like i think

1134
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,400
that would be way more stressful than

1135
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,920
doing it periodically that's a good way

1136
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,320
to think about it for sure now you

1137
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,079
mentioned earlier you mentioned gml

1138
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,000
grandmaster level

1139
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,119
one of his techniques that he does now

1140
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,800
i'm sure you're familiar with his

1141
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,280
defoliation technique where he strips

1142
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,880
those girls basically basically naked i

1143
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,119
mean barely anything have you ever gone

1144
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
that far yes that's what made that's how

1145
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
i got into defoliating in the first

1146
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
place i was following every method from

1147
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
grandmaster level because i seen the

1148
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,078
results that he was getting behind it so

1149
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,640
i'm like man i gotta try this sofa for

1150
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,920
maybe two or three years i defoliated

1151
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,759
that same way i will come in at day 21

1152
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,440
uh i usually do it a little earlier

1153
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,280
maybe like day 18 and i will come

1154
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,358
through and strip everything and then

1155
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,040
lay the net and then i just found out it

1156
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,598
makes my life so much more difficult

1157
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,119
because i was i was knocking uh sights

1158
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,880
off of the plants by trying to get the

1159
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,480
net over it and all of this other stuff

1160
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,320
the plants are way too big after they've

1161
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,240
gone through that stretch to try to fold

1162
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,320
them over now branches start breaking

1163
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,598
pots get knocked over now you got a

1164
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,359
plant in the corner that's kind of

1165
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,440
leaning because it was too big by the

1166
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,078
time you put the net on so

1167
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,320
i realized that it may be a great method

1168
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,480
and and his circumstances but in my

1169
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,800
circumstances it works better to net him

1170
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
early and just do small defoliations

1171
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,560
throughout flower because i want the

1172
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,559
same results that he got with uh with

1173
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,559
that light penetration but i don't think

1174
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,159
i need it all at once i think over time

1175
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,639
i'm going to get the same results as him

1176
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,879
i'm just going about it a different way

1177
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,199
but i got that technique originally from

1178
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,200
watching him i hadn't seen anybody do it

1179
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,639
prior to him now afterwards you've seen

1180
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,879
a whole bunch of people come out with

1181
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,400
the defoliation technique and i think

1182
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
the three of light book came out where

1183
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,880
they kind of went into detail on it a

1184
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,719
bit but uh grandmaster level was the

1185
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,680
first person who i seen doing and i kind

1186
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,598
of modeled it off off of his style

1187
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,440
even my topping technique i modeled off

1188
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,880
of his style because i noticed that

1189
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,639
there's no stunting in the plants when

1190
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,400
you just pull those top two leaves off

1191
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,159
versus knocking that head off because

1192
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,599
they have to stop and focus on making

1193
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,440
those top two branches that you're

1194
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
trying to force it to make compared to

1195
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,119
just letting those side shoots become

1196
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,039
tops afterwards different strokes for

1197
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,640
different folks yeah there's so many

1198
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,159
different ways to go about it because

1199
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,000
some people need their plants to stay a

1200
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,000
little shorter so it'd be better off for

1201
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,280
them to actually top because they're not

1202
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,719
going to stop growing with the method

1203
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,240
that i'm talking about you'll pull those

1204
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,000
top two leaves off and the plants not

1205
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,679
going to stop growing it will shoot out

1206
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,838
some more side branches but it will not

1207
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,279
stop growing so if you need it to slow

1208
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:46,719
down a little bit and focus more on

1209
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,920
getting wide then yes you're going to

1210
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,519
need to top

1211
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,159
yeah there are a lot of ways to go about

1212
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,679
it and this is one thing to remind the

1213
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,199
audience is there is a lot of different

1214
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,279
ways to go but there's so many different

1215
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,199
techniques and for those of you that are

1216
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,599
tuning in on a platform where you can

1217
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,078
leave a comment i would love to know how

1218
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,200
you do describe technique let us know

1219
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,560
down in the comment section below

1220
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,799
because there is just multiple ways to

1221
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,078
go about it yes if you're listening in

1222
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,318
you can actually read in the comments

1223
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,240
and find out different ways to do it all

1224
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,838
the people that are commenting and

1225
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,239
sharing best practices i mean that's

1226
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,480
really one of the reasons why i started

1227
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,078
this podcast is to to really pick

1228
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,079
people's brains on their style of

1229
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,160
growing and how they go about do doing

1230
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,680
things you know why they do their things

1231
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,598
and hopefully it generates some ideas

1232
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,039
for other people you know it's greatly

1233
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,200
appreciated because for those people

1234
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,800
coming in for the first time everybody

1235
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,239
got different setups everybody got

1236
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
different methods everybody got

1237
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,919
different end results everybody got

1238
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
different spaces and and requirements

1239
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,599
and limits so it's good that you're

1240
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,920
interviewing so many different people

1241
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,599
that are doing it so many different ways

1242
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,680
there there is going to be a way for

1243
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,680
them to find a way to get it done no

1244
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,358
matter what because of of the platform

1245
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,679
that you've given so we appreciate the

1246
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,039
hell out of it absolutely and people

1247
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,159
should just have fun with it right i

1248
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,400
mean yeah

1249
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,159
don't beat yourself up if uh the scrub

1250
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,838
technique doesn't go go your way the

1251
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,480
first time you know you can just try

1252
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,639
again you know yes i do have a couple

1253
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,719
more questions for you

1254
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,960
so we touched upon a little bit earlier

1255
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,078
so when you've got that net up

1256
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,679
it's very difficult to feed or water

1257
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,760
underneath that net

1258
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,078
training pruning that you need to do

1259
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,960
underneath that net do you have any tips

1260
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,318
for kind of getting under that net to

1261
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,440
work do your work

1262
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,119
yes uh for one get in shape

1263
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,960
yeah because it's gonna take a lot of

1264
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,318
crawling and reaching through crevices

1265
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,920
and everything so you have to be in

1266
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,480
shape to do something like that or pick

1267
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,079
your tables up off of the floor so if

1268
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,760
you have the ceiling height so you don't

1269
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,000
have to do as much bending over to get

1270
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,520
to everything because my setup used to

1271
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,679
be on the floor

1272
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,519
and man it used to be hectic trying to

1273
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,279
get under there to do any kind of

1274
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,280
lollipopping or anything so once i

1275
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,560
lifted them up and got them on trays it

1276
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,680
made life

1277
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,000
a little bit easier but um

1278
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,279
the the watering system is almost a must

1279
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,519
if you're going to put a net on it if

1280
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,960
you're not in like a four by four tent

1281
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,719
where you can kind of reach to the back

1282
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,079
with a wand or you don't have big enough

1283
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,838
pots where you could reach in there with

1284
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
a wand in that case yeah you might be

1285
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,838
able to get away with putting the net on

1286
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,599
and still having access to those plants

1287
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,679
but when you're talking about a larger

1288
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,280
number of plants over a longer amount of

1289
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,118
space uh

1290
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,519
you're gonna need a watering system at

1291
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,039
that point to be able to at least have

1292
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,119
the watering out the way so you can

1293
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,800
focus more on the difficult stuff like

1294
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,240
getting through that canopy and lollipop

1295
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,480
and that's why i try to do a lot of it

1296
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,078
before flower even starts so then by the

1297
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,760
time i'm in that second week and i know

1298
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,200
what's going to make it and what's not i

1299
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,720
could just go in with scissors and cut

1300
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,159
every branch off that's not going to

1301
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,759
make it through that net so i don't

1302
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,838
exactly have to go in and pull any

1303
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,760
little leafs growing in or i already

1304
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,759
took care of all of that only thing left

1305
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,800
to do is see what branches are actually

1306
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,560
going to make it through and what

1307
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,960
branches won't and if they won't those

1308
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,719
branches get cut right off good tips

1309
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,199
yeah i know quite a few people who use

1310
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,799
the wand that you mentioned they kind of

1311
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,118
they're able to get in deeper there with

1312
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,960
the wand i don't know how they connect

1313
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,800
the actual watering if they're doing

1314
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,400
hand watering if they're connecting it

1315
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,880
in that way or not yeah i can see how

1316
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,318
that would make things easier yes

1317
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,838
if you got a smaller space and you could

1318
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,599
reach to the back with that wand and

1319
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,039
maybe you're using three or five gallon

1320
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,960
pots or something

1321
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,719
you got full access to the to the plant

1322
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,119
still compared to

1323
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,480
16 one gallon pots like you you're

1324
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,760
knocking stuff over they're getting

1325
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,280
hooked on the

1326
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,359
hoses getting hooked on the watering

1327
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
system that's down there as all sorts of

1328
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,519
problems start happening snagged on

1329
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,839
branches like best to just go ahead and

1330
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,599
hook that watering system up so i guess

1331
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,078
you can say if you don't have a watering

1332
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,039
system it may be easier to run less

1333
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,720
plants in that yes right yes

1334
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,719
four plants and a four by four for

1335
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,838
example you're only having a water crawl

1336
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,480
under there and water four plants versus

1337
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,799
12 plants or 16 plants however many you

1338
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,639
do with the one gallon if i had to hand

1339
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,519
water i would probably do nine three

1340
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,279
gallon pots three three three per roll

1341
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,920
and a four by four

1342
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,599
uh scrog them out get em get em set up

1343
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,039
nicely and that way i can still reach

1344
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,880
through and a three gallon is a big

1345
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,559
enough circumference that i don't have

1346
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,400
to worry about knocking over too much

1347
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,759
stuff compared to just a one gallon like

1348
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,720
those

1349
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
man

1350
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,199
it's best to have the water in the

1351
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,719
system if you're going to do those but

1352
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,559
if i was in a bigger setup yeah i could

1353
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,159
still get away with a wand easily and

1354
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,719
running those slightly larger parts

1355
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,480
running nine instead of four

1356
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,838
another you know again you kind of you

1357
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,559
should be filling up your growth space

1358
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,078
quicker you know so yes the goals is to

1359
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,679
fill up that growth space quick and flip

1360
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,960
to flower quick you know running that

1361
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,000
nine plants

1362
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,920
would be

1363
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,599
more beneficial than running four plants

1364
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,358
because you're spending longer letting

1365
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,200
those plants grow and train and so on

1366
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,400
and so forth so fill up in pots with the

1367
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,159
roots harvesting so this is one of those

1368
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,680
things which can be kind of tricky right

1369
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,879
if you your plants are stuck within

1370
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,239
these nets

1371
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,680
do you have any tips on kind of

1372
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,639
harvesting getting them out of the nets

1373
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:54,559
are you

1374
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,480
chipping into are you clipping away

1375
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,599
individual branches or are you cutting

1376
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,119
through the net

1377
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,880
are you just trying to rip things out

1378
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,358
from underneath or how do you go about

1379
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,280
it i gotta i gotta cut through it man

1380
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,358
like the the second one's pretty easy

1381
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,519
because they're not exactly weave

1382
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:11,679
through it it's more just for support so

1383
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,800
i can actually go in and just lift the

1384
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,480
whole top net off roll it up and then

1385
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,318
everything just starts to topple past

1386
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,838
that point so you guys so that's when

1387
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,838
you got to go in with the little mini

1388
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,000
scissors uh here's a good technique for

1389
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,239
you guys go to uh

1390
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,079
like the women's makeup section and they

1391
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,159
have these little silver scissors that i

1392
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,760
think women use for i'm not sure if it's

1393
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,920
for their eyebrows or whatever but they

1394
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,839
got these like little silver scissors

1395
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,159
those ones cut through the net so easily

1396
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,920
compared to fiskars fiskars are designed

1397
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,598
for trimming plants they're not designed

1398
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,280
for cutting through nylon but those

1399
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,039
little silver ones that you get out of

1400
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,800
beauty section at like walmart or

1401
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,639
something i'm talking about just one

1402
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
little sniff they pop right through that

1403
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,960
net like it's nothing so i'll cut each

1404
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,440
plant out in a circle and then try to

1405
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,039
just i'll keep pulling at the net and

1406
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,880
cutting and it'll just keep coming out

1407
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,599
like a string until i got the whole net

1408
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,440
out chop the whole plant hole hang it on

1409
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,200
the hanger move it out the way on to the

1410
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,039
next one but yes i have to i have to cut

1411
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,480
the trellis netting out and sometimes

1412
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,400
you get lazy and don't want to cut it

1413
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,000
all out so you'll just cut the circle

1414
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,358
cut the plant hang it and it'll still

1415
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
have the net on it all the way through

1416
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:18,719
until trim time yeah

1417
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,639
yeah i've done that before for sure i've

1418
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,519
also tried to you know rip rip the

1419
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,118
plants out out from under the net and uh

1420
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,480
that just i mean

1421
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,079
buds get torn off trichomes get crushed

1422
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,309
all that stuff you're looking to trade

1423
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,880
afterwards and you're just like hey man

1424
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:37,279
[Laughter]

1425
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,039
now have you ever measured yield when

1426
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,040
doing the scrog technique

1427
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,800
measure and what measurements

1428
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,400
yeah like dry yield you know what i mean

1429
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,079
so like have you ever filled up like a

1430
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,838
four foot by four for space or whatever

1431
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,280
and kind of measure the yield you got

1432
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,440
out of that you know everything would be

1433
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,760
a yield per square foot or what do you

1434
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,880
typically get i normally do yield per

1435
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,280
light and are by tray because each light

1436
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,960
covers a tray so i normally do it by

1437
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,560
tray i'm not good at the square footage

1438
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,159
and all of that that's

1439
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,759
it gets a little bit too technical for

1440
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,480
me but um

1441
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,480
normally per 4x4 string dependent

1442
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,119
anywhere between two and two point six

1443
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,639
two and two point six pounds yep nice

1444
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,559
nice and what are you using for i know

1445
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,400
you mentioned led

1446
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,519
uh up there the scissors right there so

1447
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,960
if you're on youtube you can see the

1448
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,639
scissors those little

1449
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,159
these are the ones that you need to cut

1450
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,598
through the trellis netting like it's

1451
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,159
nothing

1452
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,079
okay all right and then you touched upon

1453
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,480
that you're using leds but what brand

1454
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,440
what model leds are using to get that

1455
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,358
yield

1456
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,920
well um

1457
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:42,799
i have one raymatix h8mr4 is similar to

1458
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,440
a bar style comes in and strips that's a

1459
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,359
thousand watt led so that one i've hit

1460
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,159
the of course the biggest numbers on is

1461
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,000
underneath that one but mainly hlg

1462
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,838
everything okay and then are you

1463
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,440
supplementing co2 in that growth space

1464
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:59,920
too or no uh you know what last round i

1465
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,039
hit my biggest harvest to date

1466
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,440
room wise with no co2

1467
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,279
but i'd normally yes i would use a co2

1468
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,920
burner because the burner comes in handy

1469
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,000
because come winter time i need heat

1470
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,079
so one of the great ways to add heat

1471
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,400
since the leds don't throw any heat out

1472
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,960
is the co2 burner so you heard it here

1473
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,880
first folks co2 does nothing for your

1474
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,159
plants let's just get this joke

1475
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,400
i think it's i think it's still up in

1476
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:29,679
the air because they do so well outdoor

1477
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,240
at a natural 350 to 400 ppms of

1478
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,039
unlimited co2 and then indoor we're

1479
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,039
pumping up with 1500 and

1480
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,558
they're still getting bigger outdoor so

1481
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,558
i'm i'm wondering how much of a

1482
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,280
difference does the co2 actually make

1483
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,960
now this run i'm gonna run co2 again and

1484
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,519
i'm gonna see how much changes and how

1485
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,519
much benefit the co2 has versus last

1486
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,599
round not using it with the exact same

1487
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:55,440
setup so i almost get to do a side by

1488
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,760
side with co2 and without co2 and if the

1489
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,440
increase is so minimal then it just

1490
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,440
won't be worth it you almost better off

1491
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,800
doing an intake outtake at that point

1492
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,960
got it yeah i'd be interested to hear

1493
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,720
your findings on that one um i do know

1494
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,159
that there have been quite a few studies

1495
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,239
in the past i mean we've been growing

1496
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,480
for so long and stuff like that i think

1497
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,558
the general consensus is that pumping

1498
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,199
co2 in there and getting your level

1499
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,839
stable you see a significant difference

1500
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,838
in yield now let's you know let's put it

1501
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,279
to the test right go ahead yes and try

1502
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:24,799
it out and see what happens you know

1503
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,400
yeah and i'm not saying if it makes a

1504
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,480
difference for you and something else i

1505
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,160
never went with the standard everybody

1506
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,639
else went with the 1500 or 1250 ppms of

1507
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,399
co2 i literally just want to double what

1508
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,318
the ambient is because i feel like

1509
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,079
there's going to be a cap out at so at

1510
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,719
some point because this plant isn't

1511
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,400
designed to take in this level of co2 it

1512
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,919
has never been designed to take in this

1513
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,760
level of co2 so double ambient to me is

1514
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,760
more than enough so if ambient is around

1515
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,839
350 to 400 then 800 750 should be more

1516
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,160
than enough for them i think once you

1517
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,159
start hitting over a thousand you're not

1518
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,920
going to see much difference between 800

1519
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,239
and 1500

1520
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,760
save yourself some co2 okay and then you

1521
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,358
also got a factor in the lower minimum

1522
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,760
right which is basically you can you can

1523
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,759
pump up 1500 co2 but if you don't have

1524
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,520
your temperature humidity nutrition dial

1525
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,839
then it's going to operate that at that

1526
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,679
lower level that minimum level right so

1527
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,239
it all needs to be in sync

1528
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,679
so yeah so wrapping things up how can

1529
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,199
the listeners find you and what do you

1530
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,558
have upcoming in the future

1531
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,879
uh yes they could either find me on

1532
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,480
beastcoastgrove420 on youtube

1533
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,720
beastcoastgrow420 on ig or the green

1534
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,079
table podcast on youtube

1535
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:38,799
um and for the future um we got some new

1536
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,359
setups coming some new rooms coming um

1537
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
a lot more soil talk for people because

1538
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,880
i'm learning that a lot more people are

1539
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,720
going towards the organic methods but

1540
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,160
they're usually buying and bringing in

1541
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:49,759
pots and everything because they don't

1542
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,440
know how to repair the native soil that

1543
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,359
they have to be able to use the ground

1544
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,800
that's already given to them so i'm

1545
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,400
going to focus a little bit more on

1546
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,800
trying to get people to

1547
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,720
repair the natural soils that they have

1548
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,640
to be able to use those versus having to

1549
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,399
spend the money to buy these super soils

1550
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,000
and make them and throwing them away

1551
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,519
each season or composting them or

1552
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,358
whatever no i'm going to show you how to

1553
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,280
make the ground that you have good

1554
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,838
enough for you to pop anything into it

1555
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,160
and it'll start growing right away um i

1556
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,000
also want to do more

1557
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:19,199
production talk for people for the

1558
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,199
people that are looking in to get to

1559
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,039
more of the production side of things i

1560
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,759
want to be able to show people a more

1561
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,519
efficient way of of scaling up from from

1562
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,920
where you were because most people are

1563
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,519
focused on scaling up so as you start to

1564
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,880
scale up i'm i'd like to go over the

1565
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,719
problems that you could have and the

1566
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,280
easiest ways around them so that's

1567
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,439
mainly the goal moving into the future

1568
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,920
helping people sounds like you got a lot

1569
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,519
of good valuable information coming up

1570
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,119
in the future so i'm definitely

1571
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,480
definitely looking forward to tuning in

1572
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,240
on that one you do have a youtube

1573
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,480
channel which i will link down in the

1574
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,719
description section below for sure so

1575
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
head on over there give him a sub and

1576
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:55,838
then also the green table podcast so

1577
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,720
that's something i tune in from time to

1578
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,960
time

1579
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,118
sometimes i think you do it on what's

1580
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,079
sunday nights right sundays 9 p.m

sunday's 9 p.m

1583
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,440
i tune in sometimes and you know

and the chill vibe that you guys have i

1589
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,039
mean you're so casual you're laid back

1590
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,400
you understand that there's so many

1591
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,558
different ways to do it

1592
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,559
it just it it took away some of my

1593
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,559
anxiety you know what i mean so if you

1594
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,119
guys like those those chill style

1595
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,720
podcasts where people aren't you know

1596
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,680
people more open-minded and understand

1597
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,919
that there's so many different ways to

1598
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,159
go about it and different techniques and

1599
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,519
sharing best practices all that stuff

1600
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,078
you know i definitely recommend giving

1601
