97
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,560
lot of fun being on the show I've been

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,920
following it for years since 2020 and so

99
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,280
uh it's good stuff um for me you know

100
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,158
people that don't know me my background

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
uh professionally as a scientist have a

102
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,919
PhD in microbiology and I've always been

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,000
fascinated with nature and natural

104
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,798
processes and at some point um as a

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,560
young adult I wanted to have more

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,200
purpose as I engaged in nature and did

107
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,959
the hikes and all the things I love to

108
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,479
do and that Drew me into the biological

109
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,319
sciences and ecology and then went on

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,119
this pathway to become a soil microbial

111
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,438
ecologist and um ultimately you know

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,560
going through a masters and then getting

113
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,280
my PhD in that area and so it's been a

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,920
heck of a journey and that's led to a

115
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,639
lot of really fruitful professional

116
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:23,120
experiences also and I think why I love

117
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,120
soil so much is because as a very early

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,160
age uh and my my parents we grew up in

119
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,840
West Texas they were from North but then

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,560
they both they were both academics and

121
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,439
they both landed jobs at at Texas Tech

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,800
University in Leck Texas where I grew up

123
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,639
and they were fanatic if not uh

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,639
obsessive and compulsive around

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,400
gardening they spent all their free time

126
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,439
changing every bit of yard into a

127
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,359
different garden bed and um they had me

128
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,439
in the yard with my little shovel and my

129
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,160
shovels got bigger As I Grew digging

130
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,680
holes helping the cultivate the soil and

131
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,360
so I I do believe that you know soil and

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
working in the soil and growing plants

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,520
is honestly something that I just grew

134
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:08,279
up with it's in my DNA so to speak and

135
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,079
um I I I can't help myself every time I

136
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:14,359
mve somewhere and I've moved several

137
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:17,120
times uh across my life I've always

138
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,439
started with with the property and

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,038
transformed it it's almost a form of art

140
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,360
for me creating perennial beds and and

141
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:30,560
you know garden beds and flowering beds

142
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,400
and annuals and so my kids um think I'm

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,879
very

144
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,439
obsessive in gardening and working in

145
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,879
the yard I spend all my free time

146
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,160
working in the soil out out in the out

147
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,240
in the yard here and so uh yeah I'll

148
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,280
blame my parents but it's just a part of

149
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,918
who I am so I get a lot of enjoyment out

150
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,000
of out of gardening and just and just

151
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,399
working in thril and and I I'll just

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,120
leave it at understanding uh at a deeper

153
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,198
level from all my academic training

154
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,600
processes and soil processes just make

155
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,600
it that much more I think intellectually

156
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,439
stimulating for me I just think about in

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,039
my mind's going the whole time and all

158
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,000
just going to this huge intellectual or

159
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,000
mental Rabbit Hole so to speak and and

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,839
just kind of have these fun daydreaming

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
experiences while I'm doing physical

162
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,959
activity in the art that's awesome and I

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,079
know one of the things you're most known

164
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,598
for is you are the inventor of Mammoth p

165
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,758
and I got to imagine that there are a

166
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,360
lot of people in the audience right now

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,720
tuning in that use Mammoth P so you are

168
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,840
the inventor of Mammoth p and you

169
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,400
switched over now you're at Mike Roy on

170
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,799
mass is that correct yeah that's exactly

171
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,839
correct and and you know that Journey

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,240
quickly working at at Colorado State

173
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:45,119
University after I graduated I did a lot

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,120
of professional um gigs at the United

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
States forest service and the United

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,000
States Department of Agriculture

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,319
agriculture Research Services and that

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,120
was between West Texas and here and in

179
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,919
Colorado where I live now in Fort

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,000
Collins Colorado ultimately I plugged

181
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,839
into uh my dream location professionally

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,879
which was the natural resource ecology

183
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,918
Lab at Colorado State University and we

184
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,520
were such a driven group it was very

185
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,918
very stimulating all my academic Heroes

186
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,198
were housed at the NRL natural resource

187
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:21,359
ecology lab and after about 4 and a half

188
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,478
years at that facility uh some of uh

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,120
some of my peers and and colleagues we

190
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,000
wanted to make a difference quicker than

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,680
just the scientific process of writing

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,598
papers and and getting Grant and going

193
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,759
down that academic setting and we

194
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,719
started thinking about and challenging

195
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,919
how we could be more applied so we could

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,280
get

197
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:46,038
solutions for Farmers now instead of you

198
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,158
know that someday someone will transform

199
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,839
our science into into application

200
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:52,399
approach we realized we had to take it

201
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,519
upon ourselves and so we started

202
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,799
developing microbial natural solutions

203
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,240
that were solving real world agriculture

204
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,918
challenges that we had identified

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,400
and that was the Journey of of creating

206
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,839
ultimately it's known as as Mammoth p

207
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,560
and what started um the the track of of

208
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,239
developing the company Mammoth which was

209
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,158
a great experience it was about an

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,800
eight-year run for me before I did leave

211
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:21,598
as you mentioned in late 22 late

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,079
2022 just to start bridging out and and

213
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,598
working with other teams and other

214
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,719
Technologies and so this Venture with

215
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,560
MIM horiculture and the microbial mass

216
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,360
group is has been really rewarding

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,639
that's awesome yeah I remember when

218
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Mammoth P kind of Hit the market uh you

219
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,799
refresh my memory on what year was I

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,560
believe it was like what 2017 or

221
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,478
something like that well listen we I

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,518
left I left the university in March 16

223
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,720
2015 to start the company we had a

224
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,959
little bit of money no resources no

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,759
facility started in a onecar garage and

226
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,599
um just started making a little

227
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,480
developing a little biofermentation

228
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,240
facility literally in a little onecard

229
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Garage in a rental flat me and my buddy

230
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,839
had

231
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,440
and that quickly scaled through the last

232
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,279
half of 2015 I got my first customer uh

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,200
so the thing was I left the university

234
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,000
as the co-founder the operational

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,839
co-founder to start the company zero

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,600
team members just me and my my my call

237
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,600
to action was I had to scale up

238
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,680
technology build out a team

239
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,759
commercialize go to market and start

240
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,159
making revenue and we had about 6 months

241
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,879
to do that before we ran out of money

242
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,159
and

243
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,799
so there was a lot of quick moving

244
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,399
ultimately I remember having my first

245
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,719
sale in Denver and we were here so we

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,000
were hitting the Denver Market pretty

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,040
hard in August 16th my first $100 bill

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,440
and I I thought wow it's an entrepreneur

249
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,919
that had an idea and we we converted

250
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,839
this idea into a a actual living product

251
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,199
that people could use in their Gardens

252
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,000
was was a fascinating Journey it's been

253
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,640
a game changer in a lot of gardens

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,360
microbi nooc in general can be very very

255
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,559
beneficial in the garden as we continue

256
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,639
on here talking about microbes I want to

257
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,679
warn you that we have a wide audience

258
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,919
here we have beginners intermediate and

259
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,838
advanced and some of these questions are

260
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,799
going to be for really for everybody

261
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,800
right I like to start with the basics

262
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,000
the beginning can you start by

263
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,359
explaining what beneficial

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,399
microorganisms are and how they function

265
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,120
in the garden ecosystem sure absolutely

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,480
so you know what I would say is is in

267
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
general um most micro mes especially the

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
beneficial microbes that um that help

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
plants grow when we think about

270
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,679
beneficial there's actually beneficial

271
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,720
microbes for humans and we call them

272
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,879
probiotics and so that's a really nice

273
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,040
familiar way to start thinking about

274
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:50,039
beneficial microbes um for plants most

275
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:54,240
of them live in the soil and they have

276
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:56,439
uh exchanged value and and help support

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,039
plant growth since they since they've

278
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,360
existed since the very beginning of time

279
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,120
and they do that by assisting plants in

280
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,759
several different ways by engaging with

281
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,120
them living in that habitat of their

282
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,399
roots and they can do a lot of things

283
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,000
they can help stimulate some levels of

284
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
chemical signaling which allows plants

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,360
to elongate their Roots so they're able

286
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,399
to take up more water more nutrients

287
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,120
what microbes are very well known for in

288
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,440
in natural settings and and in um

289
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,278
farming settings alike is nutrient

290
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,360
cycling so nutrients can get bound up in

291
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,559
substrate and soil and become hard for

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,320
plants to take them up well microbes do

293
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:43,719
a great job of exuding enzymes and other

294
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:47,440
chemistry that helps continue to create

295
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,360
bioavailable nutrients which plants need

296
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,360
um to support their growth and so we

297
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,159
know all the macro and micronutrients

298
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,320
and maybe we're not that familiar with

299
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,559
it but basically just like humans plants

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,040
need certain V vitamins and minerals and

301
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,359
elements we're all made of carbon and

302
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,439
nitrogen and all these specific elements

303
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
all all of them are listed on the

304
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,360
elemental table there's a

305
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,679
select group of macro and micronutrients

306
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,360
that plants need the only one that they

307
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,799
really get from the air is carbon and

308
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,278
everything else they get from the soil

309
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,799
and some of them are very hard to

310
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,720
extract from a plant perspective plants

311
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:34,639
do a good job of drawing up but they can

312
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,000
be nutrients can be bound and hard to

313
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,198
eliberate that's where microbes play a

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,440
critical role in natural ecosystems

315
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,240
cycling nutrients and allowing plants to

316
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,959
continue to take them up so they can

317
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,959
grow and be successful in natural

318
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,399
settings got it and what type of

319
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,239
beneficial microbes should gardeners be

320
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,720
aware of and kind of what roles to those

321
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,360
play in supporting plant Health yeah

322
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,399
that's a great question so there's a

323
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,320
there's a wide range of of microbial

324
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,159
applications that gardeners utilize

325
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
whether you know it or not if you're

326
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,919
growing in

327
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,600
soil there's microbes in that soil and

328
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,919
the plants are taking advantage of that

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,879
and uh just in in a natural setting

330
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,919
there's there's no plant that exists in

331
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,838
nature or anything in soil that doesn't

332
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,479
have a microbial

333
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,360
Association a a lot of Home gardeners

334
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,120
and even professional gardeners ERS

335
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,759
alike like to engage in composting

336
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,078
activity where there's a lot of material

337
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:42,159
and green was that can get decomposed

338
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:44,078
over time and then ultimately applied to

339
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,679
systems where it's nutrient rich and

340
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:49,679
microbial rich and so that's those are

341
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,719
what I would call some very general

342
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,479
applications where there's a wide range

343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
of undefined General microbes that we

344
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,720
know um are going to support plant

345
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,278
growth and liberate nutrients and

346
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,959
they're naturally occurring there's

347
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,039
other groups of microbes that are are

348
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:11,799
more of that um Precision application

349
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,879
that you can that you can actually

350
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,679
purchase and do research and and their

351
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,958
manufacturers it's actually a huge

352
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,638
agriculture industry it's a bio

353
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:24,958
stimulant industry where uh different

354
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:27,680
companies manufacture or ferment or

355
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,159
create different microbial formulas um

356
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,399
to perform specific fun functions some

357
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:36,159
of these formulas might Engage The Plant

358
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,159
to stimulate rooting others might Engage

359
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,240
The Plant to stimulate different

360
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:45,319
nutrient cycling some microbes are

361
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,879
actually applied just to perform a

362
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,720
pesticide function where it's going to

363
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:53,958
alleviate plants from certain pest

364
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,120
pressure um what what I'm familiar with

365
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,039
um from a manufacturing and scientific

366
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,240
point of view is

367
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,278
developing microbial solutions that

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,959
actually liberate specific elements like

369
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:09,120
phosphorus and calcium and iron which

370
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,599
are um which which are selected because

371
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,440
they're a little stickier chemically

372
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,720
which which I mean they're harder for

373
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,759
plants to maximize the uptake of those

374
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,560
specific elements in natural systems in

375
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,278
particular and so that was the

376
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,559
motivation behind um the science that uh

377
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,120
the team I was associated with at

378
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,479
Colorado University was targeting to

379
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,480
solve that solve that e ecological

380
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,199
problem the phospherous problem and

381
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,959
there's still a phospherous problem in

382
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,439
agriculture and there's still companies

383
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,679
looking to solve that particular problem

384
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,600
I heard a crazy stat I forget where I

385
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,159
heard it and I don't even know if it's

386
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,199
true or not you'll be able to tell me if

387
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,120
it's true or not but I heard that

388
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,479
99.9% of microbes haven't even been

389
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,198
identified yet is that true that's what

390
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,879
they that's what they say well if you

391
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:02,799
haven't identified them you can't tell

392
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:05,559
for sure but number is there's at least

393
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:09,318
10x to a to

394
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:11,479
99x microbes that are very hard to

395
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,759
identify and I'll tell you a pretty fun

396
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,360
story thinking about um thinking about

397
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:21,159
that and and my my journey manufacturing

398
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,839
a product Mammoth P what we wanted to do

399
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,559
was collect all the microbial diversity

400
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,279
we could from nature and so we collected

401
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,278
soils in desert systems and overseas and

402
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,639
in agriculture C systems and forested

403
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:35,679
systems and we grew up all the microbes

404
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,959
we possibly could and you know the

405
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,278
environment selects and for micro

406
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,359
microorganisms the environment to a

407
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,439
large degree it could be um abiotic

408
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,318
meaning a temperature or a moisture or

409
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,800
maybe a chemical pH type of environment

410
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,120
which is helping to select their success

411
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,000
meaning will they persist and grow well

412
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,078
or not but to a large degree the food

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,440
source is a huge selective criteria and

414
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,359
so you could grow you could take the

415
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,720
same soil samples and have two very

416
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,958
different food sources and actually

417
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
nurture and grow very different

418
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,279
microbial communities and community

419
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,360
assemblages based on that food source

420
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:22,639
which is fascinating and

421
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,759
so not only is the food source but the

422
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,120
time of growth and so you you think

423
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,480
about growing microbes and the microbes

424
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,239
I I work with will grow in a couple days

425
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,558
you know they'll be fully mature and

426
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,679
have a exponential growth curve going in

427
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:41,639
just a couple days some microbes take

428
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:45,200
weeks to grow some microbes take months

429
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,080
to grow and so the persistence the the

430
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,840
time is a factor that that really

431
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,960
predicates the complications not only

432
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,558
the diverse food sources but the

433
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,279
temporal or time that it takes to

434
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,960
actually nurture some of these microbes

435
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:03,599
are all reasons why it's it's very hard

436
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,480
to to extract uh most of the microbes

437
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,199
from nature talking about food sources

438
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,480
it reminds me of folks that use molasses

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,319
it's something I used to use a lot I

440
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
know people use it every single week

441
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,519
they're adding in molasses and what I've

442
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,679
heard is that if you continue to use

443
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,639
that as a food source you'll have some

444
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,919
microbes that feed off of it others not

445
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,919
all feed off of it and you could be

446
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,679
throwing off the balance of the soil

447
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,000
food web if you just continue to add

448
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,798
molasses in there is that true or is

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,279
that just Bro Science well actually

450
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:38,158
that's that's uh my exact perspective

451
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:41,599
and it's not just uh it's it's not just

452
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,159
from um my my knowledge around select

453
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,839
food sources like there's I have a

454
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,480
microbial media uh books and they're

455
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,918
about that thick and all these different

456
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,759
formulas with different carbon

457
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:55,240
substrates and these different types of

458
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,919
chemical agents select for specific

459
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,400
microbes and so I know for a fact

460
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,038
there's a specif it that that different

461
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,360
media and sugars uh nurture in microbic

462
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,359
communities and there is a lot of great

463
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,519
papers that are published in the

464
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,119
scientific literature that shows exactly

465
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,440
what you just shared where if you feed

466
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,119
mic molasses and it wasn't even for that

467
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
long term of a study it will allow the

468
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:24,439
microbes that grow and can eat or

469
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,798
consume molasses very well to grow very

470
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,400
well and the others that don't grow so

471
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,400
well or can't utilize that substrate

472
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,840
that sugar so quickly they won't grow as

473
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,519
well and what you find and it's is a a

474
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,480
way that I think about it life and

475
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,599
especially micro life is a probability

476
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,319
game and so once you get to a certain

477
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,119
threshold or mass as a species you have

478
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,158
a competitive Advantage you're actually

479
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,199
taking up space and occupying that space

480
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,240
which means you're occupying the supply

481
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,120
food supply in that space and so

482
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,079
if a food source can bias microbial

483
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,879
growth to certain species then it's also

484
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,678
going

485
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,320
to predicate the community structure

486
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,880
just like you said wow that's really

487
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,759
interesting so would you say that

488
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,240
molasses should not be used in the

489
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,919
garden at all or are you for it just

490
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,079
once in a while I don't like to tell

491
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,320
people what to do you know people use

492
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,158
molasses they have success and so that's

493
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:32,519
not the position I would take what I

494
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,840
would say is and I say this

495
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:39,359
consistently plants feed

496
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,119
microbes it's called exitation and so

497
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,879
from the beginning of time and and

498
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,639
molasses is a sugar and a sugar is a

499
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,880
carbon chains of carbon well the plant

500
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,080
gets carbon as CO2 from the air it

501
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,640
Cleaves off the oxygen and continues to

502
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,319
consume that carbon and it creates

503
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,000
chains of carbons and ultimately we're

504
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,519
all made of carbon we're mostly organic

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
means that carbon

506
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,000
backbone we're mostly carbon same for

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,558
plants same for

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,119
microbes what plants have evolved to do

509
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,079
from a long time ago and the ones that

510
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,678
have persisted and succeeded it

511
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,839
succeeded in biology means able to pass

512
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,679
their genome to subsequent Generations

513
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,399
that's success um creating a seed and

514
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:30,759
having that that seed propagate or

515
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,840
vegetate that ESS in biology the

516
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:37,599
successful plants that have evolved over

517
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:40,038
time learned that if they consume that

518
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:44,480
CO2 and transform some of that into

519
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:47,200
simple sugars and exude that in the soil

520
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,558
and there's all sorts of varieties of

521
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,400
exate the microbes will feed on that

522
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:57,399
exate they'll grow to these masses and

523
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,880
they'll cycle the nutrients and there's

524
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,038
a a relation ship and an exchange of

525
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
carbon for different nutrient cycling

526
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,158
and soil functions that the plants

527
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,840
actually engineer through through risos

528
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:16,559
spere priming or through exitation

529
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:19,678
so the priming or that exitation isn't

530
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,798
specific it changes over time and that

531
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,519
chemistry can change by species that

532
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,918
chemistry can change by plant needs and

533
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,918
so in some ways I feel like the plants

534
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,200
are actually directing the tra traffic

535
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,240
below ground and they can exude

536
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,319
different chemical species and different

537
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,319
types of sugars over time and slight

538
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,200
varieties including some amino acids

539
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,918
that they'll trickle in there as well to

540
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,400
nurture the community the microbes feed

541
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,799
them that support them and so that's a

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,038
very interesting way to think about

543
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,400
feeding microbes is why do we think we

544
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,599
know what's best the plant knows better

545
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,559
and the plant's going to do it naturally

546
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,839
and so I like to leave that function

547
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,319
into the plants it really is incredible

548
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,558
to know just a small piece of what goes

549
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:08,319
on in the soil in that ecosystem and and

550
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,399
how it works it's just it can be

551
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:14,119
mind-blowing I want to get deeper into

552
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,720
bacteria and this is where I kind of ask

553
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,798
you broad question and we'll see which

554
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,798
way you run with it is what are some

555
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,720
important species of bacteria that we

556
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,319
should be aware of well listen I'll I'll

557
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,038
uh I'll be very general and I'm I'm I'm

558
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,119
not as biased about species as as maybe

559
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,679
some

560
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,879
and the reason is because I've looked at

561
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,360
tens and thousands tens of thousands of

562
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,440
species and and characterize them

563
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,719
physically uh meaning not only

564
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,480
physically but functionally

565
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,400
physiologically so if you can look at

566
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,480
let's just say a thousand and different

567
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,000
bacteria that we can collect from soil

568
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,599
and there's a bunch of different groups

569
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,440
if we know there's there's family then

570
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,558
there's genre then their species

571
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,440
microbes have functional redundancies

572
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,918
and so that's a really important

573
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,880
characteristic microbes don't have a

574
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,840
specific function their biology just

575
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,880
like every other biological organism and

576
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,480
whatever they do is going to

577
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,960
overlap if we talk about cycling

578
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:20,159
nitrogen or phosphorus or you know

579
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,919
Keating or exuding some chemistry that's

580
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,278
going to initiate root

581
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,799
growth most microbes have some

582
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,240
competency within that range which is

583
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:34,158
fascinating to think and I've shown it

584
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,798
and we've collected data where if you

585
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,039
look at a wide range let's say a th000

586
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,879
microbes they all have some level of

587
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:45,319
Competency but some do it better than

588
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,240
others

589
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,678
so thinking about that functionally is

590
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,519
interesting and that's why you think

591
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,559
that there's a a wide range of microbes

592
00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:00,000
in in soil that that

593
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:04,519
persist and support PL B

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,480
growth the interesting point is

595
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,599
the resistance and resilience of those

596
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,960
particular groups meaning if a lot of

597
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,558
different groups do the same

598
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,919
thing which ones are actually going to

599
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,960
live and do things well and so I used to

600
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,720
do a lot of work in desert systems and

601
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,759
what we saw was a ton of functional

602
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,679
redundancy meaning a lot of the microbes

603
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,759
did the same thing but what they had was

604
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,519
very different environmental

605
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,679
tolerances meaning some microbes did

606
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,798
very good in

607
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:45,278
high rain events While

608
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:47,879
others didn't do great in those events

609
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:51,359
and most microbes in biology like water

610
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:55,320
but they did great in dry hot events and

611
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,879
so you wanted that diversity because you

612
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,678
need soil function across that wide

613
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,799
range of environmental

614
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:09,320
variability so what you'll find in most

615
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:11,798
let's just say products bottled microbes

616
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:14,398
that you can access commercially you'll

617
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:17,558
find billus genus and there's a whole

618
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:22,278
array of different basilla

619
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:25,519
species the reason you find them in

620
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,839
agriculture is because of their

621
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,038
resilience in environmental conditions

622
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:34,038
basil species are dormant species they

623
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,640
actually create things called endospores

624
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:39,679
which is the dormant state of their

625
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,159
vegetative cells meaning they can go in

626
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,080
this dormant State you think about

627
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,880
plants a seed is a dormant state of a

628
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,879
plant if you think about fungi spores

629
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,440
are What's called the it's like a seed

630
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,720
but a dormant stage well billus are one

631
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:00,399
of the only microbial bacterial genres

632
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,038
that produce that type of dormant State

633
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:05,278
and it's called an

634
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,319
endosport and the reason you find mostly

635
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,640
basilla species is not necessarily

636
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,158
because of their function because

637
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,320
there's a pretty good overlap of of

638
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,799
function between these basilla species

639
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:22,639
but they're very resilient meaning that

640
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:25,119
they can persist for a very long time

641
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,080
especially in dry environments in a dry

642
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,918
carrier they can persist uh for years

643
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,000
and years in soil in very harsh

644
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,960
conditions and then when the

645
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,398
environment's right they'll vegetate

646
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,679
which means activate and do what they do

647
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:45,000
to help support plant growth so I would

648
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,840
say the by far the majority of bacterial

649
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,159
species you're going to find in any type

650
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,599
of Agriculture or gardening application

651
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,200
is going to be basilis different basilis

652
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:57,879
genus I'm familiar with a handful of

653
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,798
them I know billus subtilus is kind of

654
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,600
the most common seems like it's all over

655
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,200
our skin apparently right it's like the

656
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,678
most common one on our skin and 100%

657
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,798
well well listen you know basillo

658
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,480
subtilus too it's it doesn't do just one

659
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,480
thing you know even uh this product

660
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,679
microbial mass by MIM horiculture has

661
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,159
basilis uh many basilla species in there

662
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,399
and the scientists that developed that

663
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:24,240
particular technology made sure that

664
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:25,879
they could identify some functions of

665
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,558
these different species that they did

666
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,960
very well but basilla subtilus does many

667
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:34,278
functions very well which is interesting

668
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,759
and because they can be dormant uh for

669
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,720
long periods of time they can be applied

670
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:42,480
into the market into agriculture

671
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,000
settings without dying and that's that's

672
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,399
important you can have the best and

673
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,079
that's I think that's the difference

674
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,319
between

675
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,639
academic uh fundamental science and

676
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:54,639
applied science academics get caught up

677
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,200
and I'm not speaking derogatorily I was

678
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,480
an academic but I got caught up on

679
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,679
looking at something that was super cool

680
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,200
and I absolutely fell to love with it on

681
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,360
on the on the lab

682
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:11,038
bench but if it doesn't have the other

683
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:13,000
applications and features of persistence

684
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,679
and able to be compatible in different

685
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,839
environments for different applications

686
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,159
it becomes very tricky to use that type

687
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:25,000
of organism outside of

688
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:27,320
just you know enjoying its coolness got

689
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,679
it now you mentioned dormant and I just

690
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,558
want to kind of get a little bit deeper

691
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,600
into dormy from my understanding

692
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:37,839
microbes can go dormant and they can get

693
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:40,278
out of that for example if you let the

694
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,439
medium dry out too much then my

695
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,798
understanding that the microbes go

696
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,720
dormant but when you remoisturize that

697
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:48,240
Medium they wake up and dormy for those

698
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,038
that that aren't familiar with it in

699
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,640
layman's terms say a sleep state right

700
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,960
is that all true is that do do any of

701
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,200
the microbes kind of die off due to

702
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,360
Drought they will and so again again

703
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,038
it's a probability game there's never

704
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:08,558
and always in biology and there's never

705
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:12,919
and ever and so there's always a range

706
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:15,000
of of what happens and so you know let's

707
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,480
talk about the two contrasting groups of

708
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,480
microbes uh I worked with microbes and

709
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,120
in the IP the patent that I developed

710
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:28,919
for Mammoth P they were not dormant

711
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:31,918
bacteria they were broad shaped not able

712
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,919
to form endos spores but they were very

713
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,080
robust and they had a really

714
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,159
interesting um membrane which allowed

715
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,960
them to just hold their shape even in

716
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:47,039
very dry conditions and very salty High

717
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,600
ion conditions in high osmotic pressure

718
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,640
no these these microbes came from soil

719
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,759
they're not used to being and a

720
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,038
fertilizer tank and so we had to select

721
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,960
the ones that did do a good job and it

722
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,798
turns out that you know these microbes

723
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,360
in that particular product were able

724
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,000
just to maintain their F their structure

725
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,240
even if they weren't functioning very

726
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,798
well and they're just holding on once

727
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,720
the conditions became favorable and they

728
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,599
got inoculated or they uh collided with

729
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,639
the root Zone that's their habitat

730
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,000
that's home and they could start really

731
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:27,038
functioning and rocking you know with

732
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,839
with what they do so basilis in

733
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:32,720
particular of have evolved to

734
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,319
immediately flip from an active state to

735
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,120
an endospore state or a dormant seed

736
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:42,119
State like hibernating but it really

737
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:46,079
transforms uh the structure and I guess

738
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:49,158
the the the lesson that that it's

739
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,960
basically a law uh but what it is is

740
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,919
structure equals function so what

741
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,798
happens in some cases with high osmotic

742
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:02,200
pressure a lot of water or or or or

743
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:05,960
extreme drought conditions is it

744
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,759
changes the water availability or the

745
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,798
the ability of the microbes to regulate

746
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,038
their osmotic pressure within the cell

747
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:17,440
and if they can't regulate in a very dry

748
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,079
environment hold on to their water or in

749
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,679
a very wet environment where they have

750
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:24,038
to continue to exude water because

751
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,440
they'll take in too much water

752
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:28,558
ultimately and they're cells so think

753
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,840
about a little circle think about a

754
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,319
balloon but microscopic so you couldn't

755
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,398
see it as soon think about a water

756
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,678
balloon it holds its structure until it

757
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,398
doesn't and if you have one little pin

758
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,278
prick what happens the insides squirt

759
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,599
out and that water balloon no longer

760
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,319
holds water well that's what happens

761
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,398
with microbes across the board if they

762
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,359
can't figure out how to

763
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:58,199
maintain that

764
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,879
structure to live to fight another day

765
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,360
they're going to turn they're going to

766
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,639
exude it's called licing their cells

767
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:07,359
will lice and their insides will just

768
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,319
release into their environment which

769
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,398
becomes a food source it's like little

770
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:15,158
vitamin packs so it's not necessarily a

771
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:17,638
bad thing but so some microbes will lice

772
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:20,440
during these extreme conditions

773
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:23,798
depending especially how quick the shift

774
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,159
is from dry to wet to dry and others can

775
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:29,798
maintain that environment relatively

776
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,320
well that also happens with ph shifts so

777
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:37,278
if there's more hydrogen ions or acids

778
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:40,319
versus o ions well microbes at the

779
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:42,880
cellular level have to regulate that so

780
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,638
they have these pumps literally built in

781
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,840
to their membrane to their skins and it

782
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,759
pumps out to balance the outside with

783
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,558
the inside that's what microbes are

784
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,000
always doing and it turns out that a lot

785
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,879
of the microbes that are very

786
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,278
environmentally robust are better at

787
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,278
pumping they're better at regulating um

788
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:05,679
that osmotic pressure that ion

789
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:08,079
concentrations from their interior to

790
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,398
their environment got it now what about

791
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,320
like powdered versus liquid form on

792
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,398
these microbial inoculant it kind of

793
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,240
reminds me of that I got imagine that

794
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,000
some of these powdered forms of microbes

795
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,239
they just have those microbes in there

796
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,239
that can last in a dry form is that

797
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,439
right can you talk to us about the

798
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,719
differences between liquid and powder

799
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,639
microbial inoculant yeah that's right

800
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,559
and so that is the exact difference

801
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,240
there's many different carriers of a

802
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,199
powder let's just talk about that for

803
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,000
one second every one of them are going

804
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,960
to

805
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,159
be microbes that can form a dormant

806
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,398
endospore so it's going to be very hard

807
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,919
for you to find any dry powder microbial

808
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,319
solution that isn't a billus or or a

809
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:57,039
different arrangement of bacillus and

810
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:00,119
all of those are not active in that bag

811
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,358
they're all in in that endospore form

812
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,960
and so they can stay there for a very

813
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:05,920
long time which makes it uh effective

814
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,480
for the

815
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
manufacture once those microbes are

816
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,838
introduced into an environment that they

817
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,679
sense a food source they'll vegetate

818
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,960
it's what it calls between a dormant

819
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,000
State and a vegetative state they'll

820
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,760
activate and start doing what they do

821
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,519
but they're sitting there in a seed form

822
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,440
and all it is is protein just like a

823
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,119
seed with some DNA

824
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,760
and a little bit of a little bit of

825
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,480
sugar carbon that when they can sense

826
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,160
the environment they start regulating

827
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,320
the DNA creating the proteins they need

828
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,239
to and turning into um a completely

829
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,200
different form that's incredible yeah I

830
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:46,959
was I was always curious about liquid

831
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,719
versus powder and kind of the

832
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,119
differences there because uh I know some

833
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,838
manufacturers can't offer a powder

834
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,358
although there are some benefits you

835
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,318
know shipping wise and and stuff like

836
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,400
that having a powder vers versus liquid

837
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,159
but I was just curious on that one well

838
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,680
I'll tell I'll tell you with the mammoth

839
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,039
pee product I wanted to have a powder so

840
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,000
bad but the microbes in Mammoth P I

841
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,480
could never find a carrier that I could

842
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,800
get them to persist well in and so I

843
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,719
could never get recovery when trying to

844
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,000
impregnate different dry powder

845
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:22,279
Solutions with the mammoth P microbes

846
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,079
that's why we only had a a liquid

847
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,880
offering um there are basilla endospore

848
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,640
related bacterial products that all of

849
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,519
them are dry and some of them are

850
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,559
actually also offered in liquid form and

851
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:39,519
so it really depends on the microbe and

852
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,759
and how much elasticity you have um with

853
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,079
that particular group understood one of

854
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,079
the most interesting in my opinion

855
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,480
bacteria out there are nitrogen fixing

856
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,440
bacteria so microbes that can actually

857
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,960
take nitrogen from the air convert it

858
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,000
and put it into the medium form that the

859
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,079
plant can then uptake can you talk to us

860
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,599
about microbes that fix n from there

861
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,119
yeah well there's a there's a really

862
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,160
specialized group that have done that

863
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,200
and you know that's what's so cool about

864
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,519
these it's it's it it's it's science but

865
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:11,559
once you start getting into it you're

866
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,079
like it might as well be science fiction

867
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,799
because it sounds like a science fiction

868
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,800
book you know the way they do these

869
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,560
things but you know there's microbes

870
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,160
that are that that can persist in in

871
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:26,199
very high salt contents or very hot

872
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,879
environments or very very sulfury

873
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,799
environments and all all all these

874
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,760
different environmental gradients

875
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,960
there's not as many groups as just the

876
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,640
general groups that that persist within

877
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,358
a range of temperatures and and

878
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:42,000
relatively normal

879
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:44,598
ecosystems but the AO bacteria group

880
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,480
they're fascinating and what they can do

881
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:51,480
is they're not necessarily always fixing

882
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,559
nitrogen but they're able to do that and

883
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,639
pull nitrogen which is a major element

884
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,480
from the air I don't know how many

885
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,559
people realize that but you know we're

886
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,719
breathing in nitrogen all the time as

887
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,920
far as a end gas form which is you know

888
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,919
it sounds counterintuitive these

889
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,920
microbes have evolved to take advantage

890
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,639
of that where they weren't very able in

891
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,240
certain conditions to persist because of

892
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,118
low oxygen so they create these

893
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:21,000
different ryom where they can they can

894
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,559
embed inside these plants and it creates

895
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,239
a habitat that they're very comfortable

896
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,239
in that's you know an evolutionary

897
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:30,598
strategy that allowed these particular

898
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,479
grp groups for whatever reason to to

899
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,599
succeed and it was a successful strategy

900
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,240
because they're still around today and

901
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,960
what they're able to do is in that very

902
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:44,479
very low oxygen environment pull in

903
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,880
nitrogen and use that as an electron

904
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,000
acceptor for respiration and so that's

905
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,640
the mechanism they're trying to survive

906
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,280
microbes breathe just like we do they

907
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:58,598
have to take in oxygen and they take out

908
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:02,240
CO2 but microbes have evolved to be able

909
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,880
to adapt that strategy to very very low

910
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,199
oxygen concentrations or dissolved

911
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,838
oxygen concentrations and in some cases

912
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:13,639
there's groups of anerobic which is no

913
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:17,440
oxygen environment bacteria in

914
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:19,838
particular and so when there's no oxygen

915
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,200
and it's anerobic you can't take in

916
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,480
oxygen there's none to have and so you

917
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,960
can't facilitate respiration in that

918
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,920
electron transport chain to live

919
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,318
and so they've adapted these strategies

920
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,519
to pull other elements that they're able

921
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:38,838
to pull to facilitate respiration in

922
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,960
those particular environments so it's an

923
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:44,039
amazing group of microbes you'll find

924
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,159
them in in agriculture quite quite uh

925
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:49,639
readily and what they do is they

926
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:52,679
associate especially in ryome related

927
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:56,799
conditions and they're able to help feed

928
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:58,118
um feed the plants nitrogen from Air

929
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
which you know

930
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,960
pretty cool yeah it's helpful instead of

931
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,240
having an an input to get nitrogen in

932
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,559
there whether it be you know granic

933
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,879
fertilizer or synthetic nutrients

934
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,000
whatever adding some beneficial microbes

935
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,760
in there that can actually grab it from

936
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,280
the air that's that's huge that's a

937
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,599
that's a big key and I know it is AOS

938
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,720
bacteria that's in a lot of microbial

939
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,480
inoculants yeah totally and I'll tell

940
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,000
you that's a strategy for a lot of crop

941
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,400
rotations you talk about farming

942
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,480
rotations where you're trying to keep

943
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,119
plants in the ground year round so

944
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,719
you'll have a cash crop and you'll have

945
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,280
what it's called a cover crop and

946
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:35,879
sometimes um farmers will plant

947
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,640
different crops that actually promote AO

948
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,160
nitrogen fixing bacteria in the soil and

949
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,400
it replenishes the soil in the offseason

950
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,279
with nitrogen from growing that that

951
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,079
cover crop super cool strategy oh that's

952
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,880
incredible yeah you know another type of

953
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,599
bacteria that I feel like it's being

954
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,400
talked about more and more these days

955
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,200
and it's very interesting as well as

956
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,000
endic bacteria endites can you talk to

957
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,960
us about endic bacteria well I'll tell

958
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,960
you what they are and I think there's a

959
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,599
lot of nency to understand exactly where

960
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,480
they play but um endopin bacteria and

961
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,760
and there's fungi that do this also are

962
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,400
bacteria that actually incorporate

963
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,640
inside the plant and so they'll they'll

964
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,119
work within between the cells of the of

965
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,559
of the plant cells and work their way

966
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,280
and grow within the plant and there's

967
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,400
there's always an exchange is what I'd

968
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,760
say I've heard um more and

969
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,519
more groups trying to develop idic

970
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,839
bacteria for either you know from a

971
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,440
nitrogen fixing point of view or maybe

972
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:47,358
some other poor views but there's always

973
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,838
a tradeoff and so if they're growing if

974
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:53,000
microbes are growing in the plant the

975
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:56,838
plant's giving it something to to

976
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,159
incentivize it for something in return I

977
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:03,159
would say another uh even a more

978
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:06,279
intuitive example cuz you know I I'm the

979
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:08,519
jury's still out on on exactly how

980
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,960
beneficial inop fidic bacteria are in

981
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,599
application I think that there's a a lot

982
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,280
of great science I think it's a little

983
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,318
on the nent side I've heard it EB and

984
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,640
flow for a long time and I think that

985
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:24,719
there's really fun applications I just

986
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:27,279
don't understand uh where there's a a a

987
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,078
a compelling product that I've seen a

988
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,160
clear mode of action for a long time but

989
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,599
I will tell you something that uh that's

990
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,318
been around for a long time and it's in

991
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,680
the fungal category it's arbuscular

992
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:41,159
micro risal fungi and so I know you know

993
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:43,919
about this everyone knows about am fungi

994
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:47,799
but it's the same concept where these

995
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,240
fungi actually infect and grow inside

996
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,920
the plant root they live part of them

997
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,000
live inside the plant that's the only

998
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,318
way they can be successful and there's

999
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,960
an exchange for these micro risal

1000
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:02,639
muscular micro isal fungi where they'll

1001
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,720
create these sites of exchange within

1002
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,318
the plant route the plant has to give up

1003
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,118
something and it gives up carbon the

1004
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,519
plant's always giving up carbon the

1005
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,720
plant's always giving up sugar it's a

1006
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,280
charismatic carbon pump it can look like

1007
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,480
anything it wants to look like depending

1008
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,559
on the species but it's drawing in

1009
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,519
carbon and it's transforming some of

1010
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:23,480
that into sugars to feed the soil and de

1011
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,519
feed the

1012
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,519
microbes the arbuscular micro risal Fung

1013
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:32,039
in particular called am fungi or other

1014
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,400
things are actually scavengers they

1015
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:38,400
actually have part of their bodies

1016
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:43,358
filamentous hairlike structures that

1017
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,800
exude into the soil past the root Zone

1018
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,719
and they can scavenge available

1019
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,839
nutrients and what they do a great job

1020
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,519
of is Scavenging phosphate phosphorus

1021
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:56,279
and so they're able to draw that

1022
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:59,280
phosphorus from Beyond the root uh the

1023
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,440
root growth Zone and bring it back to

1024
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,240
the plant and in these arbuscular sites

1025
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,400
they exchange phosphate to the plant for

1026
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:12,358
carbon from the plant and so although

1027
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,599
it's not Endo fidic bacteria that's an

1028
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,119
endo fidic relationship it's a clear

1029
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,599
symbiotic relationship that I think

1030
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,039
emulates a a very very clear mode of

1031
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,640
action with that same type of concept so

1032
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:26,480
when you see these micro isal fungi

1033
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,118
products that market unlocking

1034
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
phosphorus

1035
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,440
is that really what they're doing is it

1036
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,760
is it just an extension of the root Zone

1037
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,159
and that's how they're accessing that

1038
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,920
phosphorus that's right and so um and

1039
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,440
that's a little bit of a misnomer our

1040
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,358
muscular micros will fungi to unlock

1041
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,838
phosphorus typically you're talking

1042
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,880
about a bound source of phosphorus and

1043
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:51,239
you're transforming that from an plant

1044
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,920
unavailable form to a plant available

1045
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,959
form that would that's what I would call

1046
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,200
unlocking phosphorus but you know let's

1047
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,838
not get into semantics here what I would

1048
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:05,279
say is arbuscular mise are not very

1049
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,759
enzymatically capable so they're not

1050
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,079
doing a lot of the unlocking they're

1051
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,720
more like scavengers they're kind of

1052
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,599
like the hyena of the of the particular

1053
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,519
fungal Kingdom they they're able to

1054
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,720
infect the plant rout they have a a a

1055
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,519
trans a transfer location within that

1056
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,078
plant route within the cortical cells

1057
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,559
they they develop these vesicle

1058
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,800
arbuscular sites and then they extend

1059
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,359
out

1060
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,200
and to be honest with you bacteria are

1061
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,078
much more enzymatically capable to

1062
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,799
liberate phosphorus in these

1063
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,119
micronutrients and so the fungi can grow

1064
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,359
and you know they cohabitate there's you

1065
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,838
know tens of thousands of bacterial and

1066
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:48,400
different fungi within you know very

1067
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:52,440
very small uh even grams of soil and so

1068
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,519
these fungi can go and as they sense

1069
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,960
phosphate that's in a bioavailable or

1070
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,079
soluble form they can suck it up very

1071
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,440
competently and then they translocate it

1072
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,640
they keep some of it for themselves and

1073
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,240
they translocate quite a bit of it to

1074
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:09,000
the to the plant because they like that

1075
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,879
Sugar the plant feeds them so they are

1076
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,079
they're Scavenging phosphorus and you

1077
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,720
can consider that unlocking phosphorus

1078
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,240
are grabbing it from the soil the plant

1079
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,480
didn't have it so they are through that

1080
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,479
sense but but they that's that's

1081
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,159
something that's a little bit of a

1082
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,199
misconception they're not

1083
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:27,440
necessarily liberating they're capturing

1084
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,919
something that's already been liberated

1085
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,358
and and I'll say something else about

1086
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,760
phosphorus it's or uh micro Riz that's a

1087
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,558
little bit of a a misconception and

1088
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,079
there's a great studies so go look at

1089
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,440
some of these papers we can probably

1090
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:42,800
provide some in the in the links or you

1091
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,200
know it's it's uh publicly available

1092
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,839
information the higher the phosphorus

1093
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,719
availability for plant the lower the

1094
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:53,400
infection success rate is for micro

1095
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,598
Rizal fungi so if phosphorus is

1096
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,079
available the plants don't let them in

1097
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,119
as easy is what that comes down to which

1098
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,200
I think it it really speaks to the to

1099
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,318
the environmental sensitivity of the

1100
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,838
plant the plant doesn't have to give up

1101
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:09,679
that carbon if it doesn't want to and if

1102
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,279
it's getting what it needs from that

1103
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:16,000
particular microbial function it won't

1104
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,839
let them in and so the infection rate uh

1105
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,199
of micro isal fungi in a high

1106
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:24,199
phosphorous environment is much less

1107
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,358
than the infection rate of micro isal

1108
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:29,118
fungi to a plant in a very low ferous

1109
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,400
environment where the plant actually

1110
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,119
needs that symbiotic relationship wow

1111
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,680
that's interesting yeah I thought with

1112
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,400
unlocking phosphorus that it was

1113
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,358
actually like the fungi was doing some

1114
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,358
sort of nutrient cycling and then uh and

1115
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,519
then turning it from a unavailable form

1116
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,639
to an available form but that's funny

1117
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,119
that's just an extension of it and just

1118
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,480
kind of grabbing it where the roots

1119
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,559
really can't grab it yeah yeah look

1120
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,280
there's other microbial fungal groups

1121
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,440
and obviously bacteria that do a great

1122
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,319
job of that and that's why you know they

1123
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,760
coexist but they wouldn't be as

1124
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:06,480
competent if they didn't have the other

1125
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,680
microbial uh contributions within that

1126
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,000
in in that soil environment to be able

1127
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:15,039
to scavenge that phosphorus ah okay Endo

1128
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,199
micro and then Ecto micro I kind of want

1129
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,440
to get into that a little bit because I

1130
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,279
feel like a lot of my audience doesn't

1131
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,639
really know the difference I think we

1132
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,920
often hear that one of those isn't

1133
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,118
actually usable by medicinal plants can

1134
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,519
you talk to us about the differences

1135
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:31,640
between endo and Ecto sure so Endo is is

1136
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,880
related to the brusc microa group that

1137
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:38,679
we just talked about and so there's many

1138
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,559
different species of endom micral fungi

1139
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:45,039
and there's a lot of specificity and so

1140
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,480
there's uh if you talk about the genus

1141
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:50,318
species uh just getting scientific just

1142
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,960
to put a name to it it used to be called

1143
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:57,239
uh glomus intres you can also see it as

1144
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:00,199
Riso fagus intres it's the same exact

1145
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:03,798
thing myologist or scientists at study

1146
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:08,039
fungi love to change names for whatever

1147
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:09,960
reason and so there are certain species

1148
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,798
of fungi that do pretty good with

1149
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,960
medicinal plants but there's only uh a

1150
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:17,318
couple that are actually very relevant

1151
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,760
to my knowledge but there are other

1152
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:23,159
arbuscular micro rasal species that do a

1153
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,400
very good job of of interacting with

1154
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:30,118
other different plant species so there's

1155
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:34,798
a lot of plant specific it with the Endo

1156
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:38,200
or ausc micro risal fungal group The

1157
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:41,079
Ecto the same way and they're more

1158
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:45,480
associated with a woodier shrub type of

1159
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:49,720
plant and Ecto micro isal fungi don't

1160
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:52,838
penetrate but they grow like a net or a

1161
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:55,558
sheath around the root Zone it's called

1162
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:57,159
a hetic net for whatever reason because

1163
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,880
the scientists actually

1164
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:01,239
that first discovered this I think it

1165
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,000
was I forget his first name but it was

1166
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,519
Dr hetic if I'm not mistaken could be I

1167
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,960
could be completely misremembering that

1168
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,798
but I think so this is old school stuff

1169
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:15,480
but it's it's just literally a layer of

1170
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:18,880
fungal mat that grows around and covers

1171
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:22,039
the outside perimeter of roots and so

1172
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,079
that's Ecto it creates a lot of benefits

1173
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:29,159
also it creates a very very highly

1174
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:31,359
functional and in atically capable area

1175
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:35,480
right around the root Zone to maximize

1176
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:39,639
nutrient uptake and so endom micro rizy

1177
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,719
or Endo uh micro risal fungi are a very

1178
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:44,960
different group of fungi than Ecto micro

1179
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:47,358
risal fungi Ecto micro razal fungi are

1180
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,240
typically very highly functional very

1181
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:54,838
enzymatically capable and will do a good

1182
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:57,959
job of carbon and nutrient cycling to a

1183
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,318
lesser degree um

1184
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,119
they do a lot these Ecto micros

1185
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:05,358
saprophytic fungi Free Living fungi that

1186
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:10,119
actually also produce a lot of these

1187
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:12,598
Ecto micral associations and bacteria

1188
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:15,240
and the mineralizers these bacterial as

1189
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:18,200
mineralizers also interact with this

1190
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:22,000
Ecto microl lay it creates this crazy

1191
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:24,519
habitat a hot bed of nutrient cycling or

1192
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,199
nutrient availability and so it it's a

1193
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:30,199
true benefit to to plant to plant growth

1194
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:33,000
in particular so Ecto micro can be

1195
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:35,838
beneficial to plants like hemp no uh

1196
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,599
they're not no no that's not mying yeah

1197
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:39,920
they don't associate they they do

1198
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,119
associate with different shrubby types

1199
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,159
of plants and in some T and some trees

1200
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,680
and in some cases some grasses but it's

1201
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:50,558
a very different group and I I don't

1202
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,838
know any Ecto micro isal associations

1203
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,200
not that not that different medicinal or

1204
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:57,119
hemp plants can't benefit from Free

1205
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,639
Living fungi because they are very

1206
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,720
enzymatically capable and they'll

1207
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:03,279
stimulate some nutrient cycling but they

1208
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,759
won't form that true structure okay got

1209
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,160
to just want to get clarification on

1210
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,960
that one appreciate it yeah sure Colony

1211
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:13,440
forming units cfu so when somebody picks

1212
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,280
up a bottle of microbion ulent for

1213
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,200
example they look at the back cfu is one

1214
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,440
of the things that are mentioned on

1215
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,598
there can you break it down what is cfu

1216
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,639
and I know there's not going to be a

1217
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,880
clear-cut answer to this but what's an

1218
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,519
appropriate amount for bacteria fungi so

1219
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,960
on and so forth

1220
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,719
yeah I I'll just go cfu is just a

1221
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:36,519
measure uh of of density and so why it's

1222
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:40,798
a colony forming unit uh a colony is a

1223
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:44,318
visible metric and so bacteria and and

1224
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:46,920
fungi on the on the very uh early stage

1225
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:50,679
growth scale are invisible they

1226
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:53,000
microbiology micro means naked to the or

1227
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:55,078
not visible to the naked eye it needs

1228
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,760
magnification and so you think about a

1229
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,519
bacterial cell well you could never see

1230
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:04,000
it with the naked eye a colony forming

1231
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:06,079
unit is when enough of these cells have

1232
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,760
reproduced then bacteria reproduce

1233
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,240
clonally they grow to a certain size

1234
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,520
then they get too big to be efficient

1235
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:17,000
because the cell uh the cell membrane is

1236
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,358
not at the right ratio for their

1237
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,960
internal components and so they bud and

1238
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:25,039
they reproduce and so they'll continue

1239
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,679
to do that and they'll clonally

1240
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,400
reproduce and they can do it very very

1241
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:31,239
quickly at a certain stage and once

1242
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,240
they've done that enough a certain

1243
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,959
species where you can actually visibly

1244
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:39,519
see um quite honestly it looks like a

1245
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,760
little blob on a uh on a petri dish

1246
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,000
that's called a colony forming unit the

1247
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,040
only reason that's relevant is because

1248
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,440
that's the measure and it would be

1249
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,960
impossible to count the cellular the

1250
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,720
amount of cells within let's just say

1251
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,920
there's a thousand colony forming units

1252
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:58,480
well there could be a a billion cells uh

1253
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,400
that make up that thousand colony

1254
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,400
forming units and so it's it's just a

1255
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,079
measure that allows us to quantify at

1256
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,318
some level um some density uh of

1257
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,440
microbes within a particular Solution on

1258
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:14,039
a plate um whatever whatever you might

1259
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,960
think okay got it I have a question that

1260
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,239
relates to hydrogen peroxide so can

1261
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,880
microbial noids be used with oxidizing

1262
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:24,439
agents such as hydrogen peroxide or

1263
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,119
hypochloric acid will it kill off those

1264
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,240
microbes I think that's a big concern

1265
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,920
for a lot of gardeners they are using

1266
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,719
hydrogen peroxide to in order to kind of

1267
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,240
sterilize things and prevent funger

1268
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:37,078
rooth pathogens for example but they

1269
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:39,719
also want to use the microbio Nets they

1270
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,200
also want the benefits from microbes can

1271
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,399
they be used together yeah short answer

1272
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:47,199
yeah and I know that because I've I've

1273
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,920
worked with them for long enough and so

1274
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:51,719
I I'll qualify you know as a PhD

1275
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,119
microbiologists have to be really good

1276
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:56,118
at two things one is understanding how

1277
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,599
to grow and propagate microbes and the

1278
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,920
other is to be excellent at killing them

1279
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,640
because they have to keep sterile

1280
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,280
constant sterile sterile environments

1281
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:06,318
and grow the microbes they want and not

1282
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,880
grow the other ones and so really really

1283
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,318
familiar with disinfectants is what

1284
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,079
we're talking about these these

1285
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,199
disinfecting agents you know there's

1286
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,920
antiseptics which we use on our living

1287
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,199
skin um like alcohol as an example and

1288
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,119
hydrogen peroxide is actually considered

1289
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:24,078
uh antiseptic to a large degree it's

1290
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:26,798
also used as a disinfectant in uh in in

1291
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:29,760
cultivation practices the disinfect are

1292
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:33,599
typically the bleach hypochlorous acid

1293
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,280
um parastic acid H2O2 is an example of

1294
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,160
something that's been used and in

1295
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,280
general to be a to kill microbes you

1296
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:43,759
need two things first of all you need an

1297
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:50,000
agent a disinfecting agent that can

1298
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:52,960
either uh create a static or or a or a

1299
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
cal property static means freezing

1300
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,159
growth cyal means killing growth and so

1301
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,679
those are the two properties that that

1302
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:04,118
qualify as a as a appropriate

1303
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:07,519
disinfectant and there's a concentration

1304
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:10,640
and a time required on top of that and

1305
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,719
so I've tested a ton of disinfectants

1306
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,199
trying to kill microbes just to see what

1307
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,598
it would take to kill them based on

1308
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:19,960
recommended applications and there are

1309
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:22,480
very very few agents or disinfectant

1310
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,519
agents in in

1311
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,240
cultivation that are recommended for the

1312
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:31,000
appropriate time and concentration to

1313
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:34,639
effectively kill many microbial

1314
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,760
Solutions and it's because it's not

1315
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,920
concentrated enough and the time is too

1316
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,720
ephemeral it doesn't allow them to sit

1317
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,798
in that solution and so I I would

1318
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:46,598
recommend that it's you don't change a

1319
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:48,960
thing if you're having good success Barb

1320
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:51,480
it for me to change but make sure that

1321
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,358
you could integrate with confidence the

1322
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,159
biology you want to I I would say it's

1323
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:59,880
better practice to stagger

1324
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:02,239
um a disinfectant application from a

1325
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,760
from a microbial just intuitively I mean

1326
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:07,279
I wouldn't want to mix bleach with my

1327
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:11,400
microbes and say okay have at it go A a

1328
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:16,119
bleach agent or a hypochloric acid or or

1329
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:18,440
any type of chlorine H2O2 is more so to

1330
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,599
mitigate risk to maintain a level of

1331
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,760
cleanliness through the lines through

1332
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:27,559
anything that that might be uh that

1333
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:30,079
might represent a risk over time if it

1334
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:33,440
if it grows once microbes hit the

1335
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:36,680
rizosphere zone that habitat is so

1336
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,599
complex that they're buffered from much

1337
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:42,199
of that anyway and so if you think about

1338
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,440
roots and I don't know if anyone on the

1339
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:48,239
call or or you have ever seen Roots at

1340
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,720
the microscopic level it's nice to see

1341
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,919
healthy Roots just at the macro level

1342
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,838
and they're just white you know

1343
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,680
structures and you're like oh man that's

1344
00:57:54,838 --> 00:58:00,038
pretty if you look at it under a

1345
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:03,598
microscope it looks like the Canyonlands

1346
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:07,760
of Utah they're a surface area that's

1347
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,440
engineered um naturally that es and

1348
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,400
flows and there's just nothing but

1349
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,200
microscopic canans that the microbes

1350
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,519
embed in and so the surface area is

1351
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,519
inherent for maximum absorption and

1352
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,119
that's what roots function are you know

1353
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,159
the more surface area the more it can

1354
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,240
absorb so microscopically these things

1355
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:29,679
are going every which way so there's so

1356
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,078
much habitat and there's not a

1357
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:35,159
penetration typically in applications

1358
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,920
for disinfectants to actually get in on

1359
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,558
into all that surface area and so it's a

1360
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,200
little bit of a misnomer as far as I'm

1361
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:44,000
concerned that you can

1362
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:46,239
sterilize anything biologically because

1363
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,480
you can't you cannot sterilize a root

1364
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:52,479
Zone you cannot sterilize the air you

1365
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:55,199
can't even sterilize a table you can

1366
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,199
manage the concentration or the

1367
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,358
population or it of different microbes

1368
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:01,919
if you do that well enough in a root

1369
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:03,598
Zone it's absolutely impossible to

1370
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,720
Sticky sugar substance with a bunch of

1371
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:09,640
microbes in it no matter how you start

1372
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:12,078
what I would say is you can either

1373
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:14,558
select the microbes you want in there or

1374
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,599
let your environment select for you and

1375
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,798
typically if you can have a choice of

1376
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:21,680
putting beneficial microbes knowingly

1377
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,038
putting micro uh beneficial microbes in

1378
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,440
that substrate in that root Zone you're

1379
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:28,000
mitigating a lot more risk than just

1380
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,039
taking the chance that something from

1381
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,880
the environment is going to come in see

1382
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:37,480
an occupy a space that's open and infect

1383
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,519
because you know not all microbes uh are

1384
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,679
are beneficial let's just say I have

1385
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:42,960
learned so much from this podcast

1386
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,318
episode and have a feeling my audience

1387
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,599
has learned a lot as well you have just

1388
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:49,239
so much good knowledge here I appreciate

1389
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,400
your time today we're going to wrap

1390
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:51,798
things up here can you tell the

1391
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,559
listeners how they can find you and what

1392
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,639
you have upcoming in the future yeah

1393
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:57,599
absolutely Hey listen we keep on we keep

1394
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:59,598
on spreading the good word we're about

1395
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,480
nature Tech and MIM horiculture we're

1396
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,480
trying to you

1397
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,880
know make it easy from an educational

1398
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,599
point of view and from an application

1399
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,358
point of view to understand and use

1400
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:13,240
things like bio stimulants in growing

1401
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,719
and so you can always find me in my

out of Canada we've been in the US for a

1409
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:35,199
couple of years and overall you know

description section below and if you

1416
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,519
have any questions that relate to

1417
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,920
microbes leave those down in the

1418
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,480
comments section as well maybe we can if

1419
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,838
we get enough people demanding a part

1420
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,599
two maybe we get call them back on for

1421
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,000
another talk I mean we sit here and talk

1422
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:02,119
for four or five more hours I'm sure I

1423
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,960
want to thank the patreon folks

1424
