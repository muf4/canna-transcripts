welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:08,359
we interview Growers from all over the

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,079
world both beginners and experts seeking

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,000
to learn more about what they know about

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,879
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,960
their

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,240
Garden hey what's up everybody for those

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
of you that don't know me my name is

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,919
Chris aka Mr Grow and you're tuned into

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,599
to the Garden Talk podcast this episode

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,840
number 148 in this episode I interview

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,039
Luna Wickham she has been on the podcast

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,480
once before episode 111 where she talked

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
all about things that you can do in

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,280
order to increase plant taste and smell

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,840
one of the things that she mentioned in

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,840
that episode is that she uses ferments

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,160
which prompted some of you to comment on

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,600
that video requesting more details she

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,519
has a ton of knowledge on this so in

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
this episode we get into it she talks

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,600
about the different types of

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,159
fermentation and how you can Implement

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,198
in your garden if you want to see short

with Luna wickom how you doing today

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,120
good how are you thank you for having me

63
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,479
back yeah Second Time Around first time

64
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,680
was awesome we got real deep into things

65
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,159
you're one of the more advanced Growers

66
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,400
I'd say of just Advanced knowledge and

67
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,878
we had a lot of folks here that tuned in

68
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,159
and they were just blown away by all the

69
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,280
knowledge that you dropped that time

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,318
around and they wanted you back for a

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,199
second time so here we are for part two

72
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm happy to be here let's uh let's go a

73
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,518
little bit deeper let's give to the

74
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,759
people what they want absolutely So

75
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,759
today we're going to talk all about

76
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,959
fermentation for plants and when I think

77
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,639
of fermentation I think a lot of people

78
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,519
think of like k&amp;f they think of the

79
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,238
fermented plant juice fermented fruit

80
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,920
juice but there's a lot more to it than

81
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,360
just those things and that's what we're

82
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,280
going to get deep into today there's so

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,840
many different ways to go about it I

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,959
know you have certain ferments that you

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
do so finding out what you do when you

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
apply them how you make them all that

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,319
stuff uh we'll cram that to this episode

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,039
we'll see how far we can get and then uh

89
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,399
should be a very knowledgeable packed

90
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,759
episode could you just introduce

91
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,599
yourself for those that didn't catch the

92
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,479
first episode we did together yeah yeah

93
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:21,039
sure my name is Luna Wickham um I am a

94
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,479
uh educator in the kind of living soil

95
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,079
field um I do soil mineral balancing

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,199
Consulting um on my Instagram I I share

97
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,799
a lot of different recipes um like the

98
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,719
ones we're going to talking about today

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,680
and like different approaches to things

100
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,000
and how you can like up your game and up

101
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,040
your soil Health uh your plants volatile

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,039
organic compound profile which is like

103
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,519
this just the smell make things smell

104
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,120
better um get your yields up stuff like

105
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,879
that you know I have like a patreon I'm

106
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,719
a breeder um I breed you know different

107
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,598
types of uh seeds and stuff um and

108
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,039
genetics that I that I like to work on

109
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been doing that for about 10 years

110
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,158
I've been cultivating for about 16 years

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,318
and this is my passion soil and plants

112
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,639
are my passion

113
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,598
awesome and like I mentioned we did do

114
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,759
one episode together in the past I'll

115
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,719
definitely have that Linked In the

116
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,560
description section below so you can uh

117
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,239
after this episode you can click on that

118
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,640
one and go tune in to that one okay

119
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,719
fermentation let's get uh let's get into

120
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,560
it there's so much to know about

121
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,319
fermentation and so you mentioned a

122
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,918
couple like k&amp;f inputs fpj you know

123
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,360
fermented plant juice fermented fruit

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,039
juice and stuff like that which is like

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,720
a mixture of a um uh sugar but they it's

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,360
just any kind of high osmotic pressure

127
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,919
pressure input that will pull the juices

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,400
out of plant matter um and then they

129
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,918
they leave it open you leave it open

130
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,599
like a coffee filter and it'll collect

131
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,758
you know microbes specific to that

132
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,360
profile of compounds inside of the

133
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,199
organic matter and that juice so like

134
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
different enzymes and amino acids and

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
carbohydrates will attract specific

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,000
microbes that you know want to live in

137
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,639
that environment so you'll collect you

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,839
know microbes specific to that plant

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,759
matter and will help break it down make

140
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,679
it available um that's what makes it a

141
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,639
fermentation cuz fation is just a

142
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,600
biological breakdown um or changing from

143
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,079
one compound to another through biology

144
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,759
um in plant matter so there's a whole

145
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,599
bunch of different types of

146
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,840
fermentations out there like you

147
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,520
mentioned the fpj the ffj and stuff like

148
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,719
that that's an osmotic fermentation okay

149
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,000
but we also have um solid state

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
fermentation which is like bkash where

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,279
you take a dry brand and you add lactus

152
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,680
to it we can get into the details of how

153
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,719
to make that stuff um there's also an

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,120
iic fermentation which is usually used

155
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,759
with um lact bacillus lactic acid

156
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,360
bacteria serum um and then that's also

157
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
added to to plant matter and you can add

158
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,120
different inputs like calcium and amino

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
acids um and then there's you know an

160
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,959
aerobic fermentation which people often

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,319
call um compost teas and I think compost

162
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,079
te is kind of a um it's it's the very

163
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,199
widespread term used for or making them

164
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,079
but they're they're just like aerobic

165
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,800
fermentations um and and I think that

166
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,599
that's a more accurate way of describing

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,000
it so yeah I'd love to break down each

168
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,759
different category and like how to make

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,800
them and how I like to approach it where

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,680
would you like to start which one should

171
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,240
we kind of begin with so the foundation

172
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,598
for a lot of them is going to be making

173
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,759
lactic cast of bacteria serum and this

174
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,038
is a practice taught in the Korean

175
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,479
natural farming world but it's actually

176
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:27,120
goes back way before that way way

177
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,120
earlier than Korea goes back to Japan

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,399
and even you know and Greece and this is

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
a practice that was used all over the

180
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,478
world almost simultaneously it's like

181
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,240
everyone everyone did it um in different

182
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,519
areas I wouldn't say that it really came

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,478
from one specific place you know um but

184
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,000
it's essentially when milk uh will be

185
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:50,360
inoculated with lact pillus and it

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,199
separates and you get a cheese curd and

187
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,919
then you're left with the serum beneath

188
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,560
it and that Serum is a potent probiotic

189
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,799
um source of lactobacillus a whole bunch

190
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,598
different types of lactobacillus um

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,680
this was then used to add to crops to

192
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,360
boost Health um prevent pathogens it has

193
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,120
a property that's called competitive

194
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,879
exclusion it's it's very good at

195
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,800
competitive exclusion which means that

196
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:18,919
it will multiply very viciously and

197
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,680
exclude out compete different pathogens

198
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,598
and other microbes that might be

199
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,280
pathogenic or infect your plant and so

200
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,038
it was very commonly used and this is

201
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,119
this is like how cheese is made too um

202
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,360
you know so anywhere that they were

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,240
making chees cheese they were making

204
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,199
lactic acid bacteria serum and then that

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,918
byproduct was used um as a fertilizer to

206
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,800
fertilize crops and and to promote

207
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,000
nutrient cycling to prevent pathogenic

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,319
growth in the crops um it was used all

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,120
over the world it's just an ancient

210
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,240
practice lactic acid bacteria for short

211
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,079
people call it lab break down the steps

212
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,400
on how to make it yeah yeah for sure um

213
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,079
so how it's taught in Korean natural

214
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,000
farming is you collect rice wash which

215
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,918
is just starch that comes off of rice

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,199
but really you can use any kind of

217
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,719
carbohydrate source that will attract

218
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,079
microbes from the air I'm going to just

219
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,919
go through the Korean natural farming

220
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,000
process because it's the standard way to

221
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,639
do it but if you're in an area where you

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,839
really insist on not going out and

223
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,360
purchasing stuff you can use any

224
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,158
carbohydrate you know that might be

225
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,919
growing in your field or that's just

226
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,478
local to your area because that's what

227
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,799
you prefer so you take rice you take

228
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,758
rice okay um what I like to do is I like

229
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,278
to soak it over night to really get all

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,879
that starch softened off of it and shake

231
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,360
it real good inside of a jar probably

232
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,958
like 50% volume of your jar and then the

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,240
rest um

234
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,958
water and you shake it up real good

235
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,839
after about 24 hours and it'll get all

236
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,759
that starch off of it and then you

237
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,880
filter the rice out and you're left with

238
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,759
the rice wash and then with that rice

239
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,639
wash you set it out in an area people

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,600
can do it in their house they can do it

241
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,759
you know in a Cupboard I don't recommend

242
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,278
that I suggest you find a place outside

243
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,000
underneath like a covered like with like

244
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,439
a little canopy like bushes or whatever

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,839
cover it with um like a coffee filter or

246
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,920
a paper towel put a rubber brand over it

247
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,880
hope you don't have any any um Wildlife

248
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,278
or rodents that get into it but put it

249
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,879
in an area where local microbes are

250
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,679
going to be existing you know where you

251
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,879
see that there's healthy plant life

252
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,879
right set it out there usually it takes

253
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,600
only about 24 hours but you wait until

254
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,078
you see a thin film that collects on the

255
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,200
surface of the water and that is

256
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,479
microbes those are microbes it's just a

257
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
whole bunch of bacteria that starts to

258
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,440
grow on the top and you know that now it

259
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,159
it's a source of bacteria um and it's

260
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,519
not going to be just lactobacillus it's

261
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,159
going to be everything in your

262
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,399
environment that's attracted to that

263
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,000
carbohydrate in that profile of of

264
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,240
enzymes and

265
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,600
carbohydrates but it's it's enough lact

266
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,079
bacillus and what we do is we introduce

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
it to a lactic acid environment to

268
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:01,639
promote only lactic acid bacteria to

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,480
multiply and for you know this example

270
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,199
is is um milk so people use milk I like

271
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,399
to get you know if you're really bougie

272
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
and you want to make like the best the

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
best stuff find some like local cream

274
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,599
top um which will usually separate on

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,679
its own but adding more microbes to it

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
just makes it that much better um you

277
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,719
can definitely use any kind of milk um

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,480
that you get from the grocery store you

279
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,278
know 2% you know whole milk um whatever

280
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,360
you can use whatever you have on hand

281
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,600
getting something local is going to be

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
super ideal

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,360
so you take one part your rice wash and

284
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,039
you add it to 10 parts milk I like to

285
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,600
use a 5 gallon bucket if you're making a

286
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,639
whole bunch you can use like a 30 gallon

287
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,839
barrel and that's enough for a whole

288
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,000
field so you mix it up you're also going

289
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,720
to cover that um with like a paper towel

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,278
or some kind of mesh whatever um often

291
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,079
times I just put the lid of the bucket

292
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,078
on top of it but I don't seal it because

293
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,199
it's going to off gas CO2 and we don't

294
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,638
want to create a bunch of pressure

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
inside the bucket and have it

296
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,120
explode so I don't see but I just keep

297
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,399
it kind of breathing and then after

298
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,159
about 2 to 3 days you'll see it separate

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,159
and you'll have a cheese cart on top

300
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,039
that's nice and thick I just cut it into

301
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,439
pieces pour it into like a paint

302
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,919
strainer bag or something like put a

303
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,600
paint strainer bag in another you know 5

304
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,599
gallon bucket whatever and pour

305
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,240
everything in there and then you just

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
lift that cheese Curt out and that's

307
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,600
cheese and you can eat it you can press

308
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,879
it you can make cheese with it and

309
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,360
flavor it um and then we're left the

310
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,759
Lac we're left with the lactic acid

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,480
bacteria serum and um you know that's

312
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,799
that's the staple for the rest of the

313
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
processes that we're going to be talking

314
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,639
about you can use it raw people use it

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,240
at 3.5 m per gallon or a ratio of 1 to

316
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,480
1,000 um you can consume it it's a

317
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,799
little stinky but you can do it it's

318
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,879
really good for your gut health

319
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,479
um and that allows us to make fermented

320
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,000
plant extracts it allows us to make

321
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,399
solid state fermentations and then we

322
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,759
can add it to things like compost or

323
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,519
aerobic fermentations as well okay so

324
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,799
you mentioned the delution ray one to

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,720
1,000 or 3.5 m per gallon so you're

326
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,639
going to dilute it down is that going to

327
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,240
you know some people using it as a fer I

328
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,560
believe I mean soil drench is that

329
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,399
happening oh yeah you can definitely use

330
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,638
it as a foler spray um and do introduce

331
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,720
native biology native lacilla species

332
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,039
onto the leaf surface of your plants and

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,320
that would be the correct ution for that

334
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,599
too um the proper you know dose would be

335
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,120
like 3.875 or something like that but

336
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
3.5 is just fine um you can use it a f

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,679
your spray application you can use it as

338
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,839
a soil drench um I recommend doing both

339
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,399
it's really good for your plants and

340
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,440
just having it added to your fol your

341
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,519
spray routine is really great and just

342
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,399
adding it to your your soil drench soil

343
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,120
drench regimen is also really

344
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,278
good I suggest using it about once a

345
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,360
week though I wouldn't push it to every

346
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,919
time you water because it can be very um

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,320
voracious like I mentioned it's

348
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,399
opportunistic we want to like maintain

349
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,040
maximum diversity biology in our soil so

350
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,039
we don't want to overuse lactic acid

351
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,120
bacteria serum okay and I heard that you

352
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,240
can even drink this straight don't even

353
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,078
need to dilute it you just drink it is

354
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
that true or no you can do that you can

355
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,439
I

356
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,720
wouldn't um you can you can definitely

357
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
do it you know if you if you're like you

358
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,519
know you're really into that kind of

359
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,120
stuff and you want to you know you don't

360
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,000
mind the the very pungent smell and

361
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,240
taste your you can absolutely do it you

362
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,320
can also delete it down too um you

363
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,320
know humans we secrete lactic acid and

364
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,440
so often times on our bodies we collect

365
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,240
lactobacillus and so the smell is very

366
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
similar to body

367
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,560
odor oh you could put that in your mouth

368
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,800
if you

369
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:49,399
want you know but you can you definitely

370
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,639
can oh that's funny so that's lactic

371
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,078
acid bacteria I'd like to get into you

372
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,919
mentioned Bashi composting next or

373
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,638
bokashi that as being a fermentation

374
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,120
this is something that I'm actually in

375
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
the process of getting into and so I'm

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,078
super intrigued by this one break that

377
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:09,638
down for me so bukh is a solid state

378
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:12,359
fermentation of any grain carbohydrate

379
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,278
and what that means is it's not

380
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,919
suspended in water you know we add a

381
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,480
little bit of water to make it moist

382
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,679
spread the lactobacillus throughout the

383
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,839
substrate throughout the the media like

384
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,958
whatever grain carbohydrate we choose

385
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,040
which can be wheat it can be oats it can

386
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,679
be

387
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,639
um whole bunch of different things right

388
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:37,559
it could be rice itself and essentially

389
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:41,000
what it does is it is an introduction of

390
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,559
mour but it's also an introduction of

391
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,159
lactus and it helps break down and

392
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,239
compost things on the surface of your

393
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,639
soil so when you add bkash to the top of

394
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,919
your soil most of the nutrient cycling

395
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,278
that's happening in soil is happening in

396
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,639
like the first 6 to 8 in of the soil and

397
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,480
so when you add a very very potent ulent

398
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,839
like bkash it really helps with the

399
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,360
nutrient cycling in that area and then

400
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,000
that that there's like a filamentous

401
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,959
high that comes out um there's been a

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
lot of debate about what it is um but

403
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,078
there has been confirmation through

404
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,600
different doctors recently that it is

405
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:20,120
mukar and this is something that I've

406
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,639
talked in the talked about in the past

407
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,679
it's in the The Rise ofus

408
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,360
family and so what mour does is it's in

409
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:31,000
every single soil and it plays a very

410
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,879
crucial role in decomposition of

411
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,480
nutrients it also has the potential to

412
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,159
create symbiotic relationships with

413
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,319
micro so microa kind of attaches to the

414
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:43,399
root Zone it spreads out you know it

415
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,278
expands the surface area allowing for

416
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,039
more of the soil to be accessed by the

417
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,078
plant therefore more nutrients to be

418
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,159
uptaken the muor will will form a

419
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:54,039
symbiotic relationship with that microa

420
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,120
also and just extend that reach and that

421
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,318
surface area even further so it like

422
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,839
multiplies the potential for nutrient to

423
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,639
be absorbed by the plant so let's get

424
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,440
into the process of like how to make it

425
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,600
right so you'll take your green

426
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,399
carbohydrate you'll take your

427
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,040
lactus you'll dilute your lactus I

428
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,278
usually like to do 15 m per

429
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,198
gallon of the raw

430
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:19,958
lactobacillus but if you're using

431
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,599
activated lactobacillus which we can get

432
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,518
into in a little bit would be about 30

433
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,680
and this is like what your FP would be

434
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,360
or your a your activated effective

435
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,799
microorganisms delude it to about 15 per

436
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,480
gallon and then you if you want it to be

437
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,838
just super simple you can take your

438
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,759
grain you can mix it just like that you

439
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,319
mix it to what's called Field capacity

440
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,240
to where it's moist but it's not

441
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:44,159
dripping and that's like the maximum

442
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,039
amount of water it can hold without

443
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,958
runoff

444
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,240
okay take that you mix it very

445
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,318
thoroughly you remove all the oxygen

446
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,039
from it so people I like to just put it

447
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:55,599
in a trash bag I think that that's the

448
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,480
simplest approach you just throw it all

449
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,199
in a trash bag you collapse all the air

450
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,480
out of it and you tie it and then it's

451
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,038
going to fill up with air um with carbon

452
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,720
dioxide because it's off gassing a lot

453
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,119
of CO2 and then after 3 weeks it's

454
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,959
finished you dry it and then you use it

455
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,318
it's very simple to make and it's very

456
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,480
effective in the garden this is

457
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,720
something that I have been looking into

458
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
and there's recipes all over online and

459
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,880
you know one of the ones I actually

460
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,318
pulled up here it has you start with 10

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
pounds of brand and one thing I to

462
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,000
research where do you get it we can get

463
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,360
at local feed stores you can get it

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,480
pretty cheap too so you get like huge

465
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,199
like 50 lb bags for pretty cheap so

466
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,079
that's usually where people start out

467
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,519
with I fig I mentioned that one and then

468
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,599
you also mention Us in lab a lot of the

469
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,079
recipes call for EM1 which would kind of

470
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,159
be a replacement would you say you could

471
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:49,199
use either or in that case or what so

472
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,600
EM1 is a product made by ter penics um

473
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,319
and it is a lact bacillus ferment got it

474
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,279
so EM1 it has other it's a Consortium

475
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,599
right so it has mostly Lac bacillis in

476
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,319
it but it has other things like purple

477
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,399
non for bacteria um it has some yeast in

478
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,399
it it has some other stuff too you can

479
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,559
definitely use EM1 that's going to be a

480
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,919
little bit more expensive route you can

481
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,519
make your own and it's significantly

482
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,559
cheaper or if You' like to go that route

483
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,200
and you don't want to bother with the

484
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,079
risk of you know maybe messing something

485
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,720
up or the frustration of of not having a

486
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:25,038
successful culture you can absolutely go

487
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,839
out and get EM1 okay and then uh there's

488
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,319
also some other things listed here how

489
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,519
you've got like add in molasses and then

490
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,678
water and yes you can use molasses so

491
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,918
that's just like a sugar Source you can

492
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,880
also add different fermentations so

493
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,960
let's say you had some fpj some

494
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,360
fermented plant juice um that you wanted

495
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,558
to use you could add some of that as a

496
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,759
food source also you could use an FP

497
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,200
that you've used this laop culture to

498
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,158
break down um different organic

499
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,919
matter you can use different

500
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,280
polysaccharide sources so these

501
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,880
polysaccharides are just complex

502
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:01,759
carbohydrates so what I like to do um is

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,760
add Labs I'll add red beet juice which

504
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,038
is has a very you know potent

505
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,960
polysaccharide called inin in it which

506
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:11,359
is really like lactobacillus loves it

507
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,558
it's really great for lactobacillus so I

508
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,240
like to add red be as my input you can

509
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,399
add different food sources you don't

510
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,798
have to the grain itself is a food

511
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,080
source but if you want to like really

512
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,158
play with with you know getting

513
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,279
different cultures of biology and like

514
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,480
having different Expressions kind of

515
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,599
inside this bkash you can definitely

516
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,558
play with different food sources you can

517
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,439
use fruit juice vegetable juice you know

518
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,240
people use carrot beet aloe

519
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
vera and those are kind of just

520
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,319
different things that you can play with

521
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,558
and those ratios are going to be

522
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,480
different depending on what you're going

523
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,240
to be using so I don't want to get too

524
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,759
much into the specifics of that because

525
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,759
I don't want to like lead anyone astray

526
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,240
because if you use multiple inputs those

527
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,240
ratios are all going to change as well

528
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,880
so using a food source like that is a

529
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,200
good practice you don't have to do it

530
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,159
but just the simplest form is just AI

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,159
lab um and letting it ferment for 3

532
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,200
weeks in an anerobic environment with

533
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,480
without oxygen okay and then the end

534
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,519
product you kind of end up with like a

535
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,759
dry brand right right when it's yeah so

536
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,200
you have to like after 3 weeks you want

537
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,679
to spread it out on like a flat bathable

538
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,038
surface some people have like mesh

539
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,919
screens like um like window screens and

540
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,158
stuff that they use um and that's not

541
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,759
much surface area so you might want to

542
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,880
get creative often times people just put

543
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,119
it on a tarp um that works just fine

544
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
also you just spread it real thin

545
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,399
ideally in a shaded area because the

546
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,000
sunlight can damage the the

547
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,320
biology and you just let it dry out if

548
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,038
you're going to be using all of it right

549
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,038
away you don't have to let it dry out

550
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,640
you can just kind of like powder it up

551
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,400
real good and just toss it right on the

552
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,960
surface of the the Garden or the the

553
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,360
soil um you don't want it to be too

554
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,079
thick you know just like dusting it you

555
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,918
just want it to be spread kind of evenly

556
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,439
you don't want like a layer of it if

557
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,400
you've applied it to the point that it's

558
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,279
like a cake you've added too much um and

559
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,720
also what I like to do if I do add a

560
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,599
bunch is I'll scratch it into the soil

561
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,279
surface to kind of break it up because

562
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,719
it can create a thick layer that can dry

563
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,558
and then prevent um oxygen going back

564
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,000
into your soil you don't want to apply

565
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,399
too much um because then it can create

566
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
other problems also don't add it to the

567
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,278
stems like around the stems of the

568
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,919
plants sometimes if the plant is younger

569
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,319
and it hasn't kind of developed its

570
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,720
strength you can add this strong

571
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,200
microbial inoculant intended to break

572
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,839
down organic matter to your stem and

573
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,440
it'll just break down the stem so so

574
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,439
don't add it to the base of the plant

575
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,038
they keep like three four to 5 in you

576
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,798
know like a little doughnut around the

577
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,759
base of the plant ideally and then how

578
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,960
often would you apply would you only

579
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,359
apply it during a certain stage of the

580
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,440
plant's growth for example flowering

581
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:57,558
versus veg or is it good throughout the

582
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,480
whole life cycle um I personally like to

583
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:03,558
do it through vet

584
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,759
keep in mind this is a this is a

585
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,759
potent microb Source right so if you

586
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:11,000
have any kind of testing that you need

587
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:15,400
to keep your microbial counts down if

588
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,400
you add this blooming you know

589
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,960
filamentous um kind of like fungi um to

590
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,000
your surface you're creating all these

591
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,759
spores each little head has all these

592
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,159
spores inside of it and they'll fly

593
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,000
around they'll get everywhere so if

594
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,000
that's a concern to you I definitely

595
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,480
wouldn't do it um I like to keep it in

596
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,599
like my vegetative grow stages or early

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,400
flowering and then cut it out but some

598
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,918
people wouldn't agree with me that's my

599
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,679
Approach yeah I can imagine some

600
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,000
commercial facilities I mean they they

601
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,519
test for microbials so it's like like

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,880
you mentioned if you're using in flower

603
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,480
it could potentially they send out that

604
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,559
for testing and they could potentially

605
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,798
fail and then they have to throw away

606
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,798
their batch so definely totally get your

607
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,000
reasoning for that and some people are

608
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,119
allergic to it

609
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,159
they're very sensitive to the spores

610
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,839
being in the air um so if you're one of

611
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,000
those people who's sensitive to spores

612
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,079
being in the air it's probably a

613
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,278
practice that good to know and so the

614
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,439
bokashi brand after you make it you can

615
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:14,759
take that and not just apply it to the

616
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,400
soil like you mentioned but do a process

617
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,119
called bokashi composting and that's I'd

618
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,480
like to get into that if you got

619
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,798
knowledge on that cool yeah yeah for

620
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
sure I don't know if you want to start

621
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:27,400
with kind of maybe how you make a Bashi

622
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,919
bin and then kind of using the bokashi

623
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,798
brand on the food scraps yeah yeah we

624
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,360
can talk about that for sure okay this

625
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,679
is definitely like a non-traditional way

626
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,719
of composting um and it won't actually

627
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,759
break the plant matter down like into a

628
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,960
mush or into like a black substance like

629
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,278
you would usually see um doing like

630
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,120
thermophilic

631
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,038
composting it almost like pickles it

632
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,959
right like kind of keeps it in this like

633
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,960
pickled stage but once it's taken out of

634
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,519
the the bin and you throw it in like a

635
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,038
regular compost bin or on your um soil

636
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,440
surface it'll break down very quickly

637
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,319
but in this this controlled state in the

638
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,679
bkash bin it won't actually break down

639
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,519
and that's normal and sometimes people

640
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:12,038
see that and they get so your bin is

641
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,798
essentially um a bucket or any vessel

642
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,440
that has like a spout on the bottom and

643
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,278
the technique is you put down a layer of

644
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,919
bkash at the bottom of it you add a

645
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,240
layer of your organic matter usually

646
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,919
like chicken scraps kitchen kitchen

647
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,319
scraps um and then you cover that again

648
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,799
with bicash

649
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:32,798
and what it does is it'll it'll create

650
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,558
what's called lechet which it'll kind of

651
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,759
break it down it'll create this juice

652
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,639
and that juice is very very potent

653
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,839
nutrient source that you can then add to

654
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
your water and feed to your plants you

655
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,720
can add it to compost it has it's rich

656
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,640
in biology it's rich in nutrients and

657
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,440
you essentially repeat that process of

658
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,720
adding a layer of organic matter of

659
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,480
plant matter adding a layer of Bashi and

660
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,600
doing it over and over and over and over

661
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,038
again until you fill your vessel um and

662
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,199
you let it break down you know i' let it

663
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,759
kind of sit for like 3 weeks or so until

664
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,120
you get all that Leed out you can even

665
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,119
press it down to get more and then what

666
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,199
you're left with um is plant matter

667
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,558
that's still rich in organic matter

668
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,399
still rich in nutrient content um and

669
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,918
you would break that up and top driess

670
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,959
with it and it'll break down very

671
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:17,440
quickly it's really great for your

672
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,600
plants you also don't want to make that

673
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,240
too thick because it can create too

674
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,439
thick of a layer that'll prevent oxygen

675
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,038
from penetrating into the soil or you

676
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,278
can add it to regular compost Min and

677
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,679
compost it and it'll compost very

678
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:30,200
quickly also okay yeah like I mentioned

679
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm just kind of getting into it so I

680
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,840
have the 5 gallon bucket and I also

681
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,519
bought it's actually used for car wash

682
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,678
bucket it's to get like a dirt trap

683
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,398
basically you put it in the bottom of

684
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,798
the bucket but it adds in the space so

685
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:46,038
that way the liquid can kind of be down

686
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,639
on that bottom part and spout on the

687
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:51,519
side like you mentioned and then uh food

688
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,840
scraps I mean you can put bones in there

689
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,359
you can put meat in there right all

690
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,759
sorts of food you can put within there

691
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,959
as long as you're putting the brand on

692
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,599
there at least that's my understanding

693
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
of it that's what I plan to do you can I

694
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,278
would personally avoid animal products

695
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,240
really yeah was it is there a specific

696
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:16,038
reason I'm not a fan of fles in compost

697
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,038
um there's just you're playing with when

698
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,759
you start playing with breaking down

699
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:22,480
flesh and like cell and like animal

700
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,038
tissue and stuff like that you're

701
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,399
attracting biology that's going to be

702
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:30,319
breaking down flesh um and that's not

703
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:34,278
often times a good thing to have around

704
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,678
us as animals um it can it can bring in

705
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:37,359
passages and stuff like that and while

706
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,640
act bacilus by nature is very

707
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,000
competitive like it can out compete

708
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,399
things um and the potential is much

709
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
lower the possibility is still there

710
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:48,798
especially if you make a mistake um and

711
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,559
so I don't recommend using Flesh and

712
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,918
Bones and stuff like that because God

713
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,839
forbid you get something that makes you

714
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,480
very sick makes sense so what would you

715
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:58,319
recommend for somebody who is looking to

716
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,038
like reuse food scraps or whatever what

717
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,240
type of things would you add in there

718
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:07,759
safely food waste um your you know

719
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,079
lettuce tomato you know

720
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,720
your plant matter whatever if you're

721
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,158
trimming things off of your plants if

722
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,600
you have you know plant matter that

723
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,720
you've you've defoliated or that you've

724
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,918
you know pruned the bottoms off of that

725
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,440
stuff is perfect um or like the butts of

726
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,240
whatever vegetables that you're not

727
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,519
using vegetables fruits and vegetable

728
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,319
scraps is what I recommend using would

729
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,158
about like bread bread or um you can add

730
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,839
bread french fries or things like that

731
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,480
so I would stay away from anything

732
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,000
that's been like really heavily treated

733
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,278
with pesticides and stuff like that um

734
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,159
just because it's going to limit the

735
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,480
microbial activity you can definitely

736
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,000
add carbohydrates for sure um but I

737
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,240
think most ideally is going to be fruits

738
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,079
and vegetable scraps um if you really

739
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,640
want the bang for your buck I would go

740
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,960
that way and then that liquid that you

741
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,840
mentioned that you would eventually go

742
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,319
down and then you've got the spout there

743
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,000
so you're you're draining it from the

744
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:07,158
bucket occasionally does that need to be

745
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,640
diluted before doing the application to

746
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:12,240
the plants m 1 o per gallon is is

747
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,559
perfect 1 ooun per gallon okay yeah I

748
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,278
wouldn't go any higher than that

749
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,480
honestly it's pretty potent stuff you

750
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,599
can go lower than that though um and if

751
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,000
you do want to use things

752
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,158
more decrease the dosage so if you want

753
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
to increase the frequency decrease the

754
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,919
dosage increased frequency decreased

755
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,720
dosage um um so if you do want to use it

756
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,559
every watering you can drop it down to

757
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,440
like 3 m um and go like that because it

758
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,359
is it's it's decent and it's not going

759
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,798
to be as potent as a lactobacillus

760
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,038
source as straight lactic acid bacteria

761
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:47,158
serum so that's kind of an okay practice

762
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,919
if you want to do about once a week once

763
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,480
every two weeks you can go up to about

764
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,679
30 um but if you want to use it more you

765
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,798
have like a deficiency you really want

766
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,880
to correct quickly I recommend smaller

767
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:59,839
dosages and would that be for a foler as

768
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,679
well or would you only recommend a soil

769
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,199
drench with that you could use it as a

770
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,480
fol application I would I would

771
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,360
definitely drop the foler application

772
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,880
down a little bit lower too to about

773
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,038
three to five and then like you

774
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,080
mentioned that food isn't going to break

775
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,798
down entirely right so you you'll press

776
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,079
it down get all liquid out and then

777
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,278
you'll empty out with that bucket

778
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,720
eventually and I know a lot of people

779
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,240
are you know put it in their backyard

780
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,399
and then bury it down in a hole in their

781
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,558
yard for example so that's a way to go

782
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,759
about it that's kind of the way I I plan

783
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:32,319
to use it here I live in the desert

784
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:35,278
I have 1% organic matter in my backyard

785
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,119
and so I need to I need to uh I'm I'm

786
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,240
trying to reuse my scraps and I have a

787
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,918
regular compost pile I have a Verma

788
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,960
compost but I want to continue to do new

789
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,640
things here so Bashi really sparked my

790
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,880
interest there are things that you can't

791
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,159
put in the worm that you can actually do

792
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,480
through bokashi composting so I think

793
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,960
that's what interested me the most is uh

794
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,200
instead of just putting in the garbage

795
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,880
for example I can put it into bokashi

796
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,440
composting and then uh eventually try to

797
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,480
build up the organic matter that's in my

798
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,880
backyard and be growing some fruits and

799
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
veggies out there yeah 100% And if you

800
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,559
do feed it to your your worm bends the

801
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,360
worms will eat it much faster too and

802
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,639
it's really good for the worm like gut

803
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,959
health ah okay that's good to know

804
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,320
that's good to know so you take it from

805
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,640
bokashi composting big clumps put it

806
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,319
into your worm bin it breaks it down

807
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,360
even more you got the worm castings in

808
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,319
there so and that would create a very

809
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,839
high quality earthworm casting awesome

810
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,119
yeah cool so you you said um you know

811
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,319
bkash can do some things that

812
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,719
traditional composting can't we and you

813
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,319
had mentioned like using meat and stuff

814
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,360
I kind of wanted to just take a little

815
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,000
detour and kind of discuss ways of like

816
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,398
composting meat cuz I know that that's

817
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,119
like a big thing for people okay so

818
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:50,918
black soldierly larvae and like beetles

819
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,759
are a great way to break down flesh um

820
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,600
and so if you have a lot of food waste

821
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,000
let's say you're on a farm and you have

822
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,319
you know animals you're a hunter and you

823
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,798
have you know a lot of Flesh whatever

824
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,480
that would just kind of you know that

825
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,519
you're not going to be using whatever

826
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,798
you can create a black soldierly larva

827
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:10,720
bin um which are just like a species of

828
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,278
fly and they consume the flesh very very

829
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,038
quickly same with beetles will consume

830
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,119
the flesh very very quickly and then

831
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,278
their excrement is used as a nutrient

832
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,798
source and biological inoculant good tip

833
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,200
yeah I appreciate you throwing that out

834
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:27,000
there okay so next up you had mentioned

835
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,120
an aerobic form would be compost teas

836
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,440
can you get into that a little a little

837
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,959
bit Yeah so now we're going to tie

838
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,080
everything back

839
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,278
together um we can use all the inputs

840
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,839
that we discussed um you know the

841
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,880
osmotic fermentation the anerobic

842
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,678
fermentation um actually you know what I

843
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,919
think we should back up a little bit

844
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,440
okay yeah let's go to FP um because we

845
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,038
can talk about using um labs and like

846
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,320
molasses and food sources to then

847
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,919
ferment into an FP and then we can use

848
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,879
that as like an input and kind of wrap

849
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:04,120
it all together all right let's get into

850
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:07,080
FP so we talked about lact bacillus um

851
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,359
fermentation um as biological inoculant

852
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,278
right um but we can also use it just

853
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,398
like when we do Bashi buckets to break

854
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,240
down organic matter to create available

855
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:18,239
nutrients um this is also considered a

856
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
solid state

857
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,519
fermentation but we can also do an

858
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,120
anerobic fermentation in water with

859
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,240
lactobacillus to create what's called a

860
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,839
fermented plant extract and so so what

861
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,159
this is is we collect plant matter

862
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,519
typically typically you know people will

863
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,240
go out and they'll collect like Fallen

864
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,759
fruit this is what I like to do I like

865
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,599
to go collect Fallen fruit peaches and

866
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,038
apples I also like to use kind of like

867
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:45,798
um um gourds you know I'll use like

868
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,200
pumpkin and squash and and melons and

869
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,319
stuff like that which have a lot of

870
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,319
sugar inside of them they also have a

871
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,119
wide diversity you know between all the

872
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,278
things that I mentioned including beets

873
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:57,199
they have a wide diversity of

874
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,159
polysaccharides which are different food

875
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,919
sources different complex carbohydrates

876
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,639
which will contribute um different

877
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,480
organic acids and each organic acid you

878
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:08,798
know found in all of this diversity of

879
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,200
plant matter we have diversity of

880
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,558
polysaccharides we have diversity of

881
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,319
organic uh organic acids these organic

882
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,000
acids will act as um like plant

883
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,359
stimulants they're they act as phyto

884
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,960
hormones okay and each organic acid will

885
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,000
stimulate different processes in the

886
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,558
plant which can which is a whole other

887
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,079
Wormhole and we have things like

888
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,000
jasmonic acid which is the stress

889
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,439
response hormone we have oxin we have

890
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,278
gibberellins we have cinin um which will

891
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,440
all trigger different physiological

892
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:41,960
effects inside of plants so we add a

893
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,798
whole different array of plant matter to

894
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,840
water and we let it soak it'll pull

895
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,918
those organic acids out and adding the

896
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,839
lactobacillus will keep pathogens from

897
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,600
multiplying it'll also help break down

898
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,558
that organic matter and release those

899
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,158
organic acids as well as release the

900
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,200
nutrients inside of it so what we do is

901
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,840
we take the plants and the waste that we

902
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,720
have around us and we introduce it into

903
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:10,519
water and lactus and let it ferment

904
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,918
either with just the sugar sources that

905
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,639
exist inside of the plant matter or we

906
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,918
can add a little bit of masses also if

907
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,838
we don't think we have enough sugar

908
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,279
sources and this gives us a very potent

909
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,679
fertilizer that we can then dilute and

910
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,280
add to our garden regimen and it also is

911
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,480
a source of phyto hormones that we can

912
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,440
then used to stimulate growth processes

913
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,918
and we can tailor the plant inputs used

914
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,159
to have specific organic acid profiles

915
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,519
to stimulate different growth processes

916
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,000
in the plant during the time that it's

917
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,639
needed so these different phyto hormones

918
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,559
will have benefits for different plant

919
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,878
growth processes um like gibberellin is

920
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,679
good for um

921
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,598
germination cyanin um is going to be

922
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,480
good for like that transition stage um

923
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,000
the Ethylene

924
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,000
is going to be good for like finishing

925
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
and stuff like that it's going to be

926
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,440
good for your ripening stage and so we

927
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,320
can use resources um online to look up

928
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,599
different organic acid profiles a good

929
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,039
one is called Dr Duke's phytochemical

930
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,280
database you can punch that into Google

931
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,719
and you enter your plant into the search

932
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,800
bar and it'll give you a full breakdown

933
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,598
of your uh phytochemicals exist that

934
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,440
exist inside of that plant matter and

935
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,000
then we can determine what we have in

936
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,280
the plant that will stimulate which

937
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,800
growth process um in the garden that

938
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,240
we're that we're looking

939
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,359
for this can be kind of arous because

940
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,559
it's going to give you a list of like

941
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:40,759
these organic acids that you may not

942
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,159
know what they are um but you can like

943
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,400
filter it by PPM and then you can look

944
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,799
up you know the most potent sources in

945
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,000
that plant to know like when I give this

946
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,000
to my plant when I harness these organic

947
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,760
acids it can promote certain growth

948
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,639
processes in my garden so that's what I

949
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,800
really really like to play with when

950
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,759
when making fermented plant

951
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,359
extracts is like

952
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,359
creating certain Brews that are going to

953
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,440
accomplish certain tasks and have

954
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,279
specific profiles of nutrients that will

955
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,679
complement certain growth processes in

956
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,359
our garden as well let's say we have a

957
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:16,318
plant that needs a particular amount of

958
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,960
potassium at a certain growth stage or

959
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:22,519
phosphorus at another one we can tailor

960
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,000
our fermentations for vegetative early

961
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,838
flowering mid-flowering late flowering

962
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,280
um to help facilitate that growth

963
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,318
process in our garden

964
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,839
and ultimately replacing a lot of

965
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,639
products that you know are out there on

966
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,199
the

967
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,239
Shelf probably not all of them though

968
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,838
okay so fermented plant extracts correct

969
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,479
me if I'm wrong here but what falls

970
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,880
under that is fermented plant juice

971
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,880
fermented fruit juice so no it it

972
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,039
doesn't actually it doesn't okay no it

973
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,800
doesn't so um fermented plant juice is a

974
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:54,559
osmotic extraction um with like a sugar

975
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,240
store something that has a high osmotic

976
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:01,480
pressure that does not use lact bacillus

977
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:03,239
this is plant matter I like to blend it

978
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,719
to you know keep the surface area like

979
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,799
as much surface area as possible plant

980
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:10,318
matter fill

981
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,519
like I like to make 55 gallon barrels

982
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:16,279
with this okay you fill it a third to a

983
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:18,280
half if you're bold and you're really

984
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
patient you have a lot you can do like

985
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,119
3/4 um but I think like a third to a

986
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,319
half is pretty solid and then you add

987
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:32,519
your lactic acid bacteria serum um

988
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:35,719
the ratio is 1: 1 to 20 so you add one

989
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:39,119
part lactic acid bacteria serum one part

990
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:41,000
your food source and then 20 Parts water

991
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,200
so if you have a lot of sugar in your

992
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,719
plant matter you might want to tone down

993
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,118
like how much molasses that you're using

994
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,078
if you have a lot of sugar you can skip

995
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,358
it completely which is what I typically

996
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,480
do is I'll fill it with a whole bunch of

997
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,400
plant matter I like using aloe vera I

998
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,480
like using beet you know uh um

999
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,318
cantaloupe squash pumpkin premature

1000
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,920
apples you know stuff that I mentioned

1001
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:08,079
earlier um blend it all up add it to

1002
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,358
this this vessel which I actually have a

1003
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,480
video on this on my Instagram um talking

1004
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,519
about making a fermented PL extract you

1005
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,800
add your one part lact pillus to your

1006
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,800
one part food source to your 20 Parts

1007
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,960
water so let's say you have a 55g barrel

1008
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,480
right we're just going to do it right so

1009
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,079
we have a 55g barrel that's uh 200

1010
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,159
13,125 M right so if we divide that by

1011
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,400
we have 22 Parts total we know we need

1012
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,799
um about 3 gallons of lactic acid

1013
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,760
bacteria serum a little bit less about

1014
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,318
two two and two and 2/3 we would add 2

1015
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,200
and 2/3 2 and half gallons of lactic

1016
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:50,920
acid bacteria serum and if we have the

1017
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,159
volume equal to that in plant matter

1018
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,039
probably a little bit more CU you know

1019
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,838
it's not all going to be sugar you maybe

1020
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,639
twice that amount in

1021
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,759
volume we would then just add water to

1022
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,078
fill it all up but if we're skipping the

1023
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,200
plant matter completely you would just

1024
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,839
add molasses and fill it up with water

1025
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,519
and this creates a fermented um a

1026
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,519
activated effective microorganisms but

1027
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,119
with the plant matter it is a fermented

1028
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,880
plant extract you fill it up to the top

1029
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,680
you know you mix it nice and good you

1030
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,480
cap it you keep it anerobic

1031
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:24,239
you have to have a little um valve one

1032
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,880
of those little water valves like U

1033
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,439
bubble ones like that are used in

1034
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,838
fermentation people use them in beer

1035
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,318
wine and stuff like that to off gas CO2

1036
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,838
this also prevents oxygen from getting

1037
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:33,838
into the culture because it is an

1038
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,719
anerobic

1039
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,440
fermentation lactus is technically

1040
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,559
called faculative which means it can

1041
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,039
survive in anerobic anerobic conditions

1042
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,960
but in this s this situation we want to

1043
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,440
keep it anerobic as possible so we cap

1044
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,559
it we seal it we add um one of those

1045
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,679
little air off gasing bubble valve

1046
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,719
things and we'll let that sit for 3

1047
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:58,879
weeks and we watch it don't open it um

1048
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,480
let it sit for 3 weeks test it with a pH

1049
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,160
pen see what the pH is if it's between

1050
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,880
3.2 and 3.7 it's done um this will help

1051
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,838
us give an idea of how much lactic acid

1052
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,519
is is inside of the culture and when

1053
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,519
that lactic acid concentration reaches a

1054
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,440
certain level it'll be with within that

1055
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,559
range and so we know that the b or the

1056
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,358
bacteria the lactus has released enough

1057
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,000
lactic acid to reach a particular

1058
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:24,440
concentration that we know that it's

1059
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,960
done so 3.5 it's done anywhere between

1060
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,519
3.2 3.7 it's good you can't get it down

1061
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,159
that low it's a failure um it usually

1062
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,199
never gets lower than that though I've

1063
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,960
never seen that

1064
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,598
happen um you have to be careful when

1065
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,960
using plant inputs that are

1066
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,160
alkaline um if you don't get your

1067
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,800
culture low enough the lact billus isn't

1068
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:51,199
going to thrive so this is a problem

1069
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,318
when people are using um when people are

1070
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,399
using the leaves of plants that they

1071
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:58,358
might defoliate the underp part of um a

1072
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,639
common one that people do that with is

1073
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:05,960
often very alkaline

1074
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,960
um and so to kind of accommodate for

1075
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,760
that we can use things like um apple

1076
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,280
cider vinegar to drop that pH to about

1077
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,640
the 4.5 to 4 range and it'll help

1078
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,240
facilitate the multiplication of the

1079
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:22,279
lact pillus quicker um so it is good to

1080
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,799
check the um the pH before you start

1081
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,880
your culture and before you seal it

1082
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,318
because if you're using plant matter

1083
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,720
that is very alkaline it's going to

1084
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,880
interrupt the functionality the of the

1085
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,959
fermentation if you open it up after 3

1086
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,480
weeks pH is good take a little shock

1087
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,119
blast of it you know there shouldn't be

1088
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,358
a pelic which is like a collection of um

1089
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,920
lactobacillus that's going to protect

1090
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,960
the rest of the culture from oxygen um

1091
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,760
it's just like a thin film um if there

1092
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,400
isn't aicle that's good it means that

1093
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,640
your your Barrel was completely sealed

1094
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,200
and there was no air that got inside if

1095
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,879
there is a pelic it's not horrible it's

1096
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,239
not really a bad thing it isn't doesn't

1097
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,358
represent a fail um but there was oxygen

1098
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,199
that got in your barrel and that's is

1099
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,799
something to note take a little shot

1100
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,358
glass collect it set it out for a couple

1101
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,200
days see how quickly that pellicle forms

1102
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,358
if the pelic doesn't form it was a fail

1103
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:12,159
um you didn't multiply lactobacillus um

1104
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:14,078
if it does then that's a strong um

1105
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,000
that's a strong culture this is a way of

1106
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,280
determining the strength and like U

1107
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,719
microbial density of lactobacillus based

1108
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,760
products as well a lot of people sell

1109
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,039
fpes a lot of people sell laop bacillus

1110
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,280
cultures and if you don't have a

1111
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,079
microscope and you want to see if this

1112
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,440
thing is actually viable and Alive take

1113
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,079
a shot glass of it and leave it out if

1114
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,880
it doesn't form a pelicin a day or two

1115
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,440
it's weak um if you get one the quicker

1116
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,400
the better um eventually it'll probably

1117
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,200
form something but if you're at like 7

1118
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,559
days that product is inferior to

1119
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,199
something that you can make at home um

1120
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,920
that's a good thing to to know

1121
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,358
about um if you had a successful one you

1122
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,318
you got your pelic you got it within the

1123
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:58,598
PH range um this is something that you

1124
00:42:54,318 --> 00:43:01,440
would use between 15 to 60 m per gallon

1125
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,880
I typically use it just at 30 um you can

1126
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,280
use it as a f your fol your spray

1127
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,318
application um if you really want to get

1128
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,119
fancy with it you can get a

1129
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,679
refractometer and see how much sugar

1130
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,400
content is in it if you have a lot of

1131
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:18,358
sugar left in your culture after those 3

1132
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,119
weeks um you overfed it and it's not

1133
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:21,519
like a huge big deal you know it's not

1134
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,440
going to create problems but it will if

1135
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,920
you're going to start fure spraying it

1136
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,960
if you full your spray sugar onto your

1137
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,318
Leaf surface you're going to start

1138
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,639
getting things like white flies or

1139
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,639
different pests that are attracted to

1140
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,159
sugars so it's important to not overly

1141
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,279
inputs that have a lot of sugar in them

1142
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,440
and and if you do you need to have a

1143
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,559
microbial Source along with it to help

1144
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,639
consume that Sugar um but if you add too

1145
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,559
much sugar and you fully spray it on

1146
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,358
your plants you're going to have some

1147
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:49,319
big issues just to be mindful it's

1148
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,799
better to underfeed your your cultures

1149
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:53,318
than overfeed them I can't take notes

1150
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,760
fast enough there so much good

1151
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:57,920
information so much new information for

1152
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,200
me like I mentioned I I don't really do

1153
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,599
ferment right now but it is something

1154
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:04,558
that I hope to eventually get into in

1155
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,800
the future so I'm learning and I'm

1156
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,559
definitely going to be watching this

1157
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,519
episode back and taking notes Here in

1158
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,359
the future that's for sure so you said

1159
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,719
it's different than fpj and ffj do you

1160
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,719
think now's a good time to get into

1161
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,279
those things here sure we can yeah we

1162
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,239
can discuss the differences I kind of

1163
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,079
covered it a little bit um were there

1164
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,558
any like specific questions or things

1165
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,119
that you know you'd like to know about

1166
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,319
regarding them well with fpj fermented

1167
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,039
plant juice you're really only using

1168
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,318
plants with the fermented fruit juice

1169
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,519
using fruits can you use a combination

1170
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,599
of things was a question also brown

1171
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,838
sugar I know is an often a thing that's

1172
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,640
often used would you recommend that to

1173
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:43,440
use for fpj and ffj yeah brown sugar is

1174
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,679
like the that's like what the standard

1175
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,280
okay yeah it's a standard but it's

1176
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:49,679
anything with like high osmotic pressure

1177
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,359
I was chatting with some of my my nerd

1178
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,118
friends we were talking about using

1179
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,318
dextrous because it's the highest

1180
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,000
osmotic pressure um like simple simple

1181
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,079
sugar out there um and it might pull out

1182
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,039
more I've never actually done it but

1183
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:07,119
anyway yes I would use brown sugar um

1184
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:09,838
and so you you do a one: one ratio by

1185
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,960
volume mix it up kind of chop it like

1186
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,358
masticate it a little bit um and then

1187
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,480
mix it with your brown sugar at a 1 to

1188
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,279
one ratio and um some people have

1189
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,119
changed the ratio k&amp;f k&amp;f kind of is

1190
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,240
known for changing their their recipes

1191
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:23,640
over time but one to one was what I was

1192
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,439
originally taught and what I have been

1193
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,920
using and it works just fine um

1194
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,639
and then they let that sit for about 7

1195
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,280
days and then collect the juices that

1196
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,279
have separated and they'll be sitting on

1197
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,599
the bottom um and that's something that

1198
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,519
you use at a 1 to 1,000 um application

1199
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,960
rate

1200
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:44,280
also you need to have a microbial Source

1201
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,119
when you're using it um cuz like I said

1202
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,720
it's pretty much just sugar it's like

1203
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:51,760
syrup um and you can you can use it like

1204
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:54,279
syrup you can eat it um you might want

1205
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,480
to seal it up um with like a

1206
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,960
fermentation lid if you're going to be

1207
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,400
making it for consumption

1208
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:05,318
um but it's like sugar and so when in

1209
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,960
knf people are using those um those

1210
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:08,639
inputs with lactobacillus but they're

1211
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,519
also using what's called indigenous

1212
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,759
microorganisms which is just the name of

1213
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:15,440
the input which is um it's rice that has

1214
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,559
been undercooked and left out in the

1215
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,800
forest to collect microbes

1216
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:25,880
um this it'll it'll form that that

1217
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,680
filamentous H layer like bkash bkash

1218
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,640
will like mour

1219
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,039
um the claims are that it's collecting

1220
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,960
indigenous microorganisms and

1221
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,800
multiplying them this is not a practice

1222
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,519
that I use um it seems to me that it's a

1223
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,960
method of introducing a mour and biology

1224
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:47,400
throughout your soil um I just like to

1225
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,838
use Bashi instead um I think it's

1226
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,000
simpler it doesn't take a lot of time

1227
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:55,159
anyway point being you have to add a

1228
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,039
microbial source to your um your

1229
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,639
fermented plant juices you don't want to

1230
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,558
add um sugars to it so what they'll do

1231
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,118
is they'll add IMO they'll add fpj

1232
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,640
they'll add brown rice vinegar as your

1233
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,838
enzyme Source um they add water soluble

1234
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,118
calcium they have like a whole range of

1235
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:12,239
things that they use and they use them

1236
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,760
together um and it's important that you

1237
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,358
have that Consortium of stuff you have

1238
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,960
your inoculant you have your enzyme

1239
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,759
Source you have your nutrient Source um

1240
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,480
you have your your you know your

1241
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,400
protectors they call them like the micro

1242
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,280
police which the lactic acid bacteria

1243
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,280
um and they introduce it all together as

1244
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,319
this complete picture and you know they

1245
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,000
recommend you know not using one alone

1246
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,239
um and I recommend that also if you're

1247
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,920
going to be using something high in

1248
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:41,838
sugar you have to have mic microbes and

1249
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,280
enzymes that go along with it not going

1250
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,078
to be brown rice vinegar that can be a

1251
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,680
little bit of apple cider vinegar there

1252
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,839
are a lot of different enzyme sources

1253
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:52,558
out there you can also use things like

1254
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,400
sprouted seed teas which are seeds that

1255
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,079
have been sprouted full of enzymes you

1256
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,160
blend them they're a very potent enzyme

1257
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:02,119
source um you can add you know that too

1258
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,519
but it's important that you have biology

1259
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,480
the enzymes the lactobacillus and then

1260
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:09,880
your fermented plant juice your sugar

1261
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,358
Source because it's just like straight

1262
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,440
sugar and that can be problematic if

1263
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:17,318
used alone Yeah you mentioned several

1264
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,639
different k&amp;f processes and that's a

1265
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:21,159
topic in itself or episode in itself I

1266
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:24,199
should say I had a couple people on in

1267
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:26,078
the past that were talking knf and it's

1268
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:28,919
so fascinating the way everything works

1269
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,920
together on that Avenue and yeah we get

1270
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,760
super deep into into that into a future

1271
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,079
episode yeah there's a lot to talk about

1272
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,160
around around knf but maybe we should

1273
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:40,039
stick to the fermentation one thing uh I

1274
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,118
would like to get into if I think we

1275
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:45,159
have time here is the compost teas so I

1276
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,559
know a lot of people use compost teas

1277
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,318
there's right ways to go about it

1278
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,839
there's wrong ways to go about it

1279
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,239
there's some people that say that you

1280
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,199
shouldn't use them at all so maybe

1281
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,479
that's the question I ask you to begin

1282
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:59,399
is this broad question you have folks

1283
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,199
who say they use compost te's frequently

1284
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,920
and they gain a lot of value out of it

1285
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,199
you've got other people that say just

1286
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,400
use compost just top dress of compost

1287
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,358
and water it in doing a tea isn't going

1288
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,798
to have any additional benefits what's

1289
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,239
your take on that

1290
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:18,599
so it depends

1291
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:21,919
um yeah adding compost top drifting

1292
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,240
compost is going to be a much if the

1293
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,280
compost is quality is going to be a much

1294
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,199
safer way of introducing biology and and

1295
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,319
nutrients

1296
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:34,039
um it's in its original form you add the

1297
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:36,480
water the microbes get introduced um the

1298
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:39,480
nutrients are there it makes it very

1299
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:43,599
simple where the problem comes in is if

1300
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:46,199
you have a lot of soil you need a lot of

1301
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,318
compost to cover it so if you're growing

1302
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,439
in a field you're growing any

1303
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:52,079
significant amount of food and you don't

1304
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,039
have enough compost to do that compost

1305
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,400
tees are a great way to stretch that

1306
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:59,599
biology um and often times you know

1307
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,000
people don't take into consideration

1308
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,920
that when we're making compost tees

1309
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
we're also we can also add other things

1310
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,838
to the compost te um that wouldn't be

1311
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,559
present inside of a thermophilically

1312
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:14,119
composted compost um or even a

1313
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,798
mesophilic composted like um insect

1314
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:18,680
frass or um earthworm

1315
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:20,759
castings a little bit earlier I had

1316
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:23,000
mentioned diversities of organic acids

1317
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:27,440
used um as like phyto hormones to

1318
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,798
promote plant processes um we can add

1319
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,880
inputs that introduce those organic acid

1320
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:33,199
profiles to our compost EAS and make

1321
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,000
them more effective and more readily

1322
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:39,279
available to our soil um we can also use

1323
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,719
different inputs in our compost teas to

1324
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,920
encourage microbial multiplication all

1325
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:45,798
cells require amino acids all proteins

1326
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,838
you know are formed through amino acids

1327
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,000
so what I like to do in my compost is

1328
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:53,078
I'll add an amino acid Source um I'll

1329
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,920
add different diversities of complex

1330
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,640
carbohydrates of polysaccharides to

1331
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,159
encourage diversity of

1332
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:05,598
biology compost teas are not the native

1333
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:09,358
environment for soil biology um sure

1334
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,280
soil gets wet but it does not water

1335
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:14,798
right so when you make compost teas

1336
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,160
you're taking you're taking biology out

1337
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:18,838
of its native environment and you're

1338
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:22,399
putting it in water and you're going to

1339
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:25,039
limit the diversity that it can multiply

1340
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,559
it still is very effective um but you're

1341
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,358
not going to have the microbial

1342
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,119
diversity that you would get if you were

1343
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:36,440
to just top dress it but top dressing an

1344
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:39,000
acre is is a huge task top tressing you

1345
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,440
know half or quar or whatever if you're

1346
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,920
trying to b remediate a piece of land

1347
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,318
it's going to be very difficult and take

1348
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,480
many many years to do um composting um

1349
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,318
traditionally and adding compost to to

1350
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,599
the soil surface compost are a great way

1351
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:55,599
to just help kind of bridge that Gap to

1352
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,559
add biology to help cycling cycle

1353
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,280
nutrients earlier

1354
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:02,280
so I think that it's they're just tools

1355
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,920
and I think to be like oh this tool is

1356
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,760
just better than this tool I think that

1357
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,000
this tool has an application

1358
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,359
specifically um that's going to be ideal

1359
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,559
and then this tool has another and all

1360
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:13,279
of these things that we're talking about

1361
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,440
today they're all just tools and some of

1362
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,160
them are going to have strengths and

1363
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,519
some of them are going to have

1364
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:18,960
weaknesses and some are you know not

1365
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:22,400
going to be ideal in certain situations

1366
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,000
um compost is just another one of them

1367
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,160
so you can play when making a compost te

1368
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,199
you know people use

1369
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:30,519
compost obviously you can use

1370
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,719
thermophilic which is going to be your

1371
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,079
traditional turned compost you use

1372
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,159
mesophilic which is going to be your

1373
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,798
earthworm castings or your insect prass

1374
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,960
they're going to have different profiles

1375
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:43,559
because they are made through different

1376
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,679
processes one is through the turning and

1377
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,359
um heating up of microbes that break

1378
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,239
down the Plant matter into compost the

1379
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:52,838
other is being consumed by insects and

1380
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:57,000
going through their gut biome um and

1381
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:59,880
using their excrement I prefer

1382
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,760
um mesophilic breakdown mesophilic

1383
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,119
composting um because when it doesn't

1384
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,160
get to that higher temperature isn't

1385
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,440
going to cook off other biological

1386
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,719
species that can't survive in those

1387
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,798
temperatures um you know microbes they

1388
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,279
some of them prefer um acidic

1389
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:17,838
environment some you know more basic

1390
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,559
some you know colder some hotter and as

1391
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:22,759
we heat them up we're creating an

1392
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,960
environment that those you know those

1393
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,240
microbes that want that warmer

1394
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,760
temperature are going to exist in while

1395
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,000
in mesophilic we going to leave a larger

1396
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,319
profile of

1397
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,159
biology so in my compost I like to use

1398
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:38,759
Earth room casting specifically um and

1399
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:41,118
if and it reduces the potential for

1400
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,599
pathogens if whoever made it didn't turn

1401
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,559
it properly um making compos is an art

1402
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,119
and if you mess it up you can introduce

1403
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:49,680
pathogens I've seen people introduce

1404
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,798
septoria um and you know ferium

1405
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,078
different pathogens through thermophilic

1406
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:56,679
uh thermophilic compost um very

1407
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:59,160
regularly especially with mushroom

1408
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:03,078
compost that people use

1409
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,719
um so I like to use Earth castings um as

1410
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,680
my biological inoculant and my like

1411
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,719
compost source so I'll take earthor

1412
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:11,919
castings I'll throw them in a vat of

1413
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,000
water um your Brewing vessel people will

1414
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,960
like to add um bubble snakes which is

1415
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,440
just like a a tube that wraps around the

1416
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,599
bottom that has holes in the bottom and

1417
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,240
they blow bubbles down and it agitates

1418
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,599
the the water and you have a brew bag

1419
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:27,639
and you put all your your inputs in it

1420
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,240
and it kind of agitates it um and it

1421
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,558
like Scrubs the biology off of your

1422
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,838
inputs and it soaks into the water and

1423
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,720
then while it's in the water it has your

1424
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:37,159
food source which people usually like to

1425
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:39,239
use molasses um I like to play run and

1426
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:42,679
add some different things I like to add

1427
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:45,558
um oat flour which is something that Dr

1428
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,519
Lane Ingam talks about um it has more

1429
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:50,240
lipids in it and there's more like you

1430
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,280
know fats in there for you and for the

1431
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,759
biology and has a lot of starch and

1432
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,160
stuff and has um you know

1433
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,960
polysaccharides that are good different

1434
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:58,920
complex carbohydrates that'll more

1435
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,679
diversity of biology and then I like to

1436
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,400
use beet juice um which you can see

1437
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:05,480
which I've talked about which is inin

1438
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,599
you know it's a very strong Prebiotic

1439
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,798
these polysaccharides they're prebiotics

1440
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:12,838
right and that's what I make my teas

1441
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:16,318
with oat flour and be juice with

1442
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:18,358
earthworm castings and then before the

1443
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,440
like long fermentation process which is

1444
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:24,078
usually about 24 to 36 hours um I like

1445
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,599
to add things are going to promote

1446
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,519
cellular development things are going to

1447
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:31,760
promote microbial multiplication like I

1448
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:34,400
said before all proteins require amino

1449
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,160
acids to be built so I like to add amino

1450
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,039
acids um you can get products that have

1451
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,719
amino acids in them there's like soy

1452
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,359
based amino acid products there's

1453
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:46,558
fish-based amino acid products um you

1454
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:48,679
can use um aloe vera which I also like

1455
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,119
to use however I prefer to use it at the

1456
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:53,038
end and I'll get to that in a second um

1457
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,960
so I add an amino acid Source but then

1458
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,880
I'll also add a calcium Source there is

1459
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,960
a Korean natural farming input called

1460
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,880
called water soluble calcium um and it's

1461
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,838
essentially exactly what it says it is

1462
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,720
but it's um calcium

1463
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:09,838
carbonate that has had apple cider

1464
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:11,279
vinegar added to it and it breaks down

1465
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,558
and it makes it an available calcium

1466
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,559
form it makes calcium acetate um because

1467
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,240
apple cider vinegar has acetic acid in

1468
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,559
it and it creates chemical reaction

1469
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,919
calcium acetate is one of the most

1470
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,359
available forms of calcium that we can

1471
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,200
find in nature and I'll add that to my

1472
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:28,318
compost as well so I'm creating the

1473
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:31,000
foundation for microbial multiplication

1474
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,159
and diversity of biology in my compost

1475
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,480
with a biological input earthworm

1476
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:38,920
castings which has a very wide range of

1477
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,838
biology um compost tees can be as

1478
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,599
creative or simple as you want them to

1479
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:46,199
be you could literally throw Earth

1480
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:49,318
castings in a bucket with molasses and

1481
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:52,159
let it sit and then dilute it and water

1482
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:53,960
it in and it would work um you can get

1483
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,558
very creative with what you're using you

1484
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,679
can go find different you know plant

1485
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,039
inputs that have different sugar

1486
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,639
profiles um that feed different profiles

1487
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:03,960
of

1488
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:05,078
biology um which is what I like to do

1489
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,720
which is what

1490
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:10,920
I which is what I'm kind of known for um

1491
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:14,480
is kind of creating these more

1492
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,920
concoction potion based uh compost to

1493
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,280
use in my garden and then there will be

1494
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,798
some inputs after you brew that you

1495
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,000
would want to add um that you don't want

1496
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:25,199
to add

1497
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,559
beforehand for me that's like your

1498
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:30,480
inputs that are going to have

1499
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:32,039
Rich profiles of organic acids or um

1500
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,639
amino acids that you don't necessarily

1501
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:37,000
want to be broken down so I like to add

1502
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:39,000
my like aloe vera which has you know 19

1503
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,239
of the 20 different amino acids it has a

1504
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,960
whole bunch of enzymes it has a

1505
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:46,199
polysaccharide called aaminin um which

1506
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,199
has tons of soil benefits um and will

1507
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,118
elicit plant responses just that

1508
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:53,358
compound itself it also has oxin in it

1509
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,559
um which is a plant growth hormone C

1510
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,000
cause like explosive growth in the plant

1511
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,599
I don't want any of those compounds to

1512
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,760
be broken down by biology so I'll add

1513
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,200
them at the end so if you have a plant

1514
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,400
input or just input in general that you

1515
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,759
want to use to stimulate specific growth

1516
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,039
processes add it to the end of your

1517
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,119
compost because biology changes

1518
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:14,359
compounds from one thing to another

1519
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:16,079
um and so when you're using an aerobic

1520
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:19,798
fermentation that's much more likely to

1521
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:23,079
happen than in like an anerobic one

1522
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:25,239
um also lact pillus lactic acid bacteria

1523
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,720
serum since I talked about how vicious

1524
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:30,679
and opportunistic it is if you add it to

1525
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:32,959
your compos T pre Brew it can multiply

1526
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:35,480
and dominate the rest of the biology in

1527
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,400
the in the Brew leaving you with less

1528
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,318
diversity um so I like to add that to

1529
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,519
the end also good to know about the

1530
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,920
inputs added after the Brew I don't

1531
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,519
think a lot of people add inputs after

1532
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:51,720
the Brew to be honest now you mentioned

1533
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:53,358
a brew time of 24 to 36 hours and

1534
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:54,919
there's a lot of information some people

1535
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:57,000
say it should be shorter some people say

1536
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,440
it should be longer can you just give us

1537
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,400
high level what are the risks of brewing

1538
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,079
for too long and then what are the

1539
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,519
downsides of brewing for not long enough

1540
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,760
so here's the

1541
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:12,960
deal the time period thing is just to

1542
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,000
make it easy for people

1543
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,760
um it's going to depend on a lot of

1544
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,199
different factors how much you fed how

1545
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,440
much inoculant you used um what the

1546
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:22,798
temperatures are outside what the

1547
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,119
temperature of your water is does your

1548
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:27,759
water have um any kind of contaminant

1549
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,559
you know what's the calcium amount you

1550
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,599
know what's the sodium amount what's the

1551
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,519
um do you have chlorine in your water

1552
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:35,400
which always you should not have

1553
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,960
chlorine in your water by the way a good

1554
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,119
point um these are all going to affect

1555
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,599
how quickly the biolog is going to be

1556
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,039
multiplying in your in your Brew so when

1557
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,559
people are like do a short Brew it's

1558
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,160
because like yeah if you mess it up and

1559
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,119
you know it multiplies too much you can

1560
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,838
have an imbalance in your your

1561
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,400
biological profiles things like protool

1562
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,400
will start to take over which can be

1563
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,039
potentially pathogenic they're also an

1564
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,720
important part of nutrient cycling

1565
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,000
they're like our predators

1566
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,439
um I know that's complicated but there's

1567
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,358
many different species of them um

1568
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:09,240
so in like soil food web Sciences right

1569
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:11,960
we use microscopy to identify the

1570
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:14,479
profile of biology existent in our

1571
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,519
compos we have a particular microbial

1572
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,039
density of lower lower bacteria you know

1573
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:23,038
like um and then we have our our

1574
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,000
protozoa we have our amibas you know we

1575
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,319
have you know different types of

1576
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,400
protozoa we have our ciliates we have

1577
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:29,558
our felet we have our um rotifers and

1578
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,240
stuff like that and there's things that

1579
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:33,480
we do and that we don't want um and

1580
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,078
given a certain amount of time we're

1581
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,240
going to see our protozoa show up in

1582
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:40,400
numbers which will consume a lot of our

1583
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:41,798
lower bacteria which is what we need um

1584
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,240
but we also need a certain count of

1585
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:46,880
protozoa so it's one protozoa usually a

1586
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,519
ciliate for 10 field views and so when

1587
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,519
people are like how long should I brew

1588
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,000
my tea it's like well it depends on how

1589
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,759
many protozoa have multiplied inside of

1590
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,599
your compost te um so it it's it's not

1591
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,240
a simple answer the simplest safest way

1592
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:07,240
would be just like do it for 24 hours do

1593
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:10,239
it for 6 hours do it for just mix it and

1594
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:11,679
water it in you know like um cuz we're

1595
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,759
playing with Biology you know we're

1596
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,639
playing with bacteria you know there's a

1597
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,920
reason why why why people

1598
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,838
are cautious when playing with bacteria

1599
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,519
and multiplying bacteria because it you

1600
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:23,960
could you can mess it up you know you

1601
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:26,079
can make mistakes you can make people

1602
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,079
sick you make yourself sick um that's

1603
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,240
one of the reasons why people say don't

1604
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,400
do it um this is one of the reasons why

1605
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,679
I only use earthor castings um you know

1606
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,358
I had a buddy who was turning mushroom

1607
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:38,000
compost he got um um some like fungal

1608
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,318
infection in his in his blood you know

1609
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,960
like it's just you know we're we're

1610
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,798
Farmers you know we we play with plants

1611
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,280
and stuff we play with Biology but like

1612
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:46,960
I just had someone yesterday tell me how

1613
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,160
he got something from from turning

1614
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,760
compost um you can have like asper

1615
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,399
Gillis you know like you inhale asper

1616
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,920
Gillis like you're GNA you're gonna make

1617
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,920
yourself sick so to answer your question

1618
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:03,440
is there isn't a very simple answer um I

1619
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:06,838
usually do 24 to 36 hours 24 you want it

1620
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,000
more bacterial dominated and 36 if you

1621
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,199
want it more more

1622
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,559
protozoa and to determine which one you

1623
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:17,159
would want you would need to get a

1624
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,960
microscope and examine the profile of

1625
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:22,078
biology in your soil and so if you have

1626
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,000
low microbial density you want to add a

1627
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,200
compost tea that's going to have a lot

1628
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,440
of lower bacteria in it going to have

1629
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:31,118
like a lot of simple bacteria and then

1630
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,760
if you see in your soil that there um

1631
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,039
Aren't Enough protozoa you're going to

1632
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,640
let your you're going to want your

1633
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:39,319
compost te to run a little bit longer to

1634
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:42,038
introduce protozoa into your soil um and

1635
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:47,000
that's only determined by by what the

1636
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:50,160
microscope through microscopy um so that

1637
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,440
I do 24 to 36 hours understood well

1638
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,480
there has been so much good information

1639

01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,440
took a break for a while but I'm getting

1665

01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,199
and you find that on

1668

magazine I'm publishing skun magazine um

1670
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,719
we just had a new skunk seed line drop

1671
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,160
um our website is up skunk Global

1672
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,519
genetics.com awesome I'll definitely

1673
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,078
have a link I believe to your link tree

1674
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,519
that's I think what we used last time so

1675
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:18,798
we can probably do the same thing this

1676
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,278
time around that'll get all the links to

1677

experience there's so many different

1691
01:04:49,278 --> 01:04:52,519
ways to go about breeding I would love

1692
