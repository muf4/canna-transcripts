1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,359
coming up on Garden talk in a two by two

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,759
you know that's 16 tops give or take so

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,919
if I can if I can get 16 Tops on one

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,500
plant and they all have about five to

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,599
seven nodes that's a perfect canopy to

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,698
start flour with I come home to happy

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,800
healthy plants when I have Organics when

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm dealing with synthetics I tend to do

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,699
something wrong or I over feed or

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,739
something goes wrong and then I end up

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,679
with issues I want to keep a quicker

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,358
cycle if I can but you know I also want

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,640
to have the most yield I can get out of

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,640
that space so if I have to veg a little

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,799
longer I will worry about it the next

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,719
run man I think that's my best bet is to

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,459
keep my my stress levels down because

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,219
it's very easy when you're passionate

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,920
about these plants to let it get to you

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,719
and stress you out but I think that the

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,320
happier I am the happier my plants

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,320
generally are

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,698
foreign

24
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:59,578
what's up everybody if you that don't

25
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,960

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,659
years and he grows in a you guessed it

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,000
two by two grow space he focuses on

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,859
maximizing that grow space in order to

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,118
achieve the highest yield possible and

34
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,219

also have a 9-inch version it's easy to

78
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,439

Talk podcast today I'm joined with Vince

88
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,098
but most of you know him as two by two

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,598
Gorilla Glue how you doing today doing

90
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,759
very good Chris how about yourself man

91
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,859
doing good good appreciate you coming on

92
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,079
today uh well looks like I have a

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,379
visitor over here my cat Max likes to

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,700
jump up

95
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,959
so uh yeah we're just going to keep on

96
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,060
recording I'm going to let him settle

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,239
down and then we'll continue on with

98
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,479
this episode so

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,819
so you grow in a smaller grow space two

100
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,818
feet by two feet grow space to be exact

101
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:50,039
and you maximize that space which helps

102
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,378
of course maximize yield now training

103
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,900
the plants to fill up the space is a

104
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,179
given but there's a lot more to it so in

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,640
this episode I'd like to get into your

106
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,680
way of maximizing yield in a small space

107
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,939
but first can you tell us a little bit

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,860
about yourself and how you got into

109
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,259
gardening definitely

110
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,860
um so I've been gardening medicinal

111
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,079
plants since 2019 so about 3 or four

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,000
years now

113
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,239
my first real experience with gardening

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,459
in general was you know four or five six

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,219
years old at my grandparents house they

116
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,519
had a nice backyard lots of cool plants

117
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,199
growing and I remember having an apricot

118
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,819
tree back there that I just broke a

119
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,919
branch off of and stuck in the ground

120
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,599
and you know let it do its thing and

121
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,459
eventually we were getting fruits off of

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,500
it which is you know very cool to see

123
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,899
and so ever since then I've always kind

124
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,120
of had a interest in Plants that's

125
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,638
awesome so let's start off by talking

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,319
about your current growth setup now I

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
know you're in a two foot by two foot

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,740
grow tent correct me if I'm wrong there

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,680
can you tell me a little bit about your

130
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,540
setup like what brand grow tent what

131
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,060
lighting are you using other equipment

132
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,000
you know so and so forth definitely so

133
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,079
I'm in uh it's technically it's a 26

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,478
inch by 26 inch by 55 inch grow tent the

135
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,139
brand is called one deal

136
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,918
um pretty standard grow tent my

137
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,040
lighting I have a Viper Spectra

138
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,879
p1500s 150 watt LED

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,879
um

140
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,360
yeah so far as my other stuff in there I

141
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,978
have an AC Infinity T8 fan which is uh

142
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,960
the one with the controller which is

143
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,060
it's definitely overkill for such a

144
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,560
small space but I I bought it for a

145
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,959
larger tent that I have that I'm still

146
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,839
waiting to set up but I just keep it at

147
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,180
a lower setting and it does great for

148
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,219
that space yeah the TA that's that's the

149
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,400
big boy there a lot of people using that

150
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,340
in like large like four by eights or ten

151
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,500
by tens things have full rooms that's

152
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,719
exactly what I was what I got it for was

153
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,639
a 4x8 Vivo Sun tent that I'm just

154
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,740
waiting to set up at the moment that

155
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,478
makes sense yeah I think in the two by

156
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,120
two what would you typically run maybe

157
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,300
like a an ideal world like a four inch

158
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,860
setup or what I would say uh four inch

159
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,478
is ideal

160
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,879
um anything else is going to be a little

161
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,279
bit Overkill I I always like to say that

162
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,899
uh it's okay to have a little more fan

163
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,698
than you need but if you have a little

164
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,918
less you're still going to be fine like

165
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,379
before I have the AC Infinity I was just

166
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,819
using like small little desk fans you

167
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,560
just now you stick them in the vent and

168
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,478
just have it pulling some air in pulling

169
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
some air out and you know as long as you

170
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,918
have air exchange I think you you're

171
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:32,339
okay yeah absolutely now are you growing

172
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,620
autoflowers or photo periods at the

173
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,038
moment I have not done any auto flower

174
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,259
work I've only worked with photo periods

175
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,180
um a lot of flowers are cool though

176
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,699
um I think just a little more

177
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,199
unpredictable but for the most part I

178
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,660
think it's it's cool like I wouldn't

179
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,879
mind having an Autoflower run under my

180
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,300
belt eventually I'm doing an Autoflower

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,100
run right now and uh I mean I I heard a

182
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,780
long time ago that they were recommended

183
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,400
for beginners and a different

184
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,839
conversation here but I got to disagree

185
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,459
with that there's uh they could be

186
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,198
tricky in some areas especially if you

187
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,000
have that stunned growth within the

188
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,340
first 20 or 30 days I mean you could

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,240
really stunt a plant and then end up

190
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,859
with a real small Autoflower so anyways

191
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,579
so photo periods is what you're growing

192
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,000
now are you in soil or cocoa are you

193
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,939
doing a hydroponic system or what uh my

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,740
current run is in kogo pure Coco No

195
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,860
perlite or anything

196
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,639
um the run before this I was in uh Roots

197
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,860
big or big Roots was the soil brand uh

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,340
it's just a super soil mix but really

199
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,139
enjoyed that uh in terms of the systems

200
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,239
I mean I like all systems I think

201
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,639
they're all fun to work with it's just a

202
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,160
matter of budget and just how much time

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,800
you have to invest into you know your

204
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,319
your grow did you start with the brick

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,020
of cocoa or was it a bagged cocoa that's

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,800
already kind of pre-rinsed and all that

207
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,978
stuff

208
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,780
yes it was a bagged cocoa the brand is

209
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,360
Mother Earth Coco

210
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,939
um yeah I think that like you're saying

211
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,220
you know before before I go for a brick

212
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,560
if I can find a bag of you know cheaper

213
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,300
kind of less expensive bagged cocoa I'd

214
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
probably go with that over any of the

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,500
the bricked options but you know there

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,780
are some pretty cool options out there

217
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,660
for the bricks as well like I like the

218
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,279
they come in almost like a puck with uh

219
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,780
with the bag attached and you just kind

220
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,279
of fill it and then I think floor

221
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,878
effects does it and maybe some other

222
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,939
companies too but I like that idea I've

223
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,379
mostly used the bricks and uh you know

224
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,200
it's it's good for like shipping

225
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,519
purposes but one of the bricks I had

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,759
from some brand I don't remember the

227
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,879
name of it like super salty like even

228
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,679
after rinsing and buffering it still had

229
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,659
problems with my plants but I have this

230
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,759
other brand which I can't think of this

231
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:54,480
name either that I got off of Amazon

232
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:57,120
pretty recently and no issues I just did

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,339
I didn't even rinse more buffer because

234
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,019
I'm doing some sort of uh testing I've

235
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,060
got going on here but didn't rinse or

236
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,799
buffer and I had no issues so it's kind

237
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,199
of a hit or miss with the bricks in my

238
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,299
experience but uh but yeah a lot of

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,959
people do tend to go towards the bagged

240
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:14,579
stuff since it is typically already

241
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,278
pre-rinsed and buffered and so on and so

242
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,820
forth definitely definitely now what

243
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,458
size grow pots do you use and type grow

244
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,580
pots you can fabric a plastic or what uh

245
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:29,819
current run I'm in one gallon plastic

246
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,220
pots so they're they say one gallon it's

247
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,440
a seven inch tall pot I feel like it's a

248
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,540
little bit less than a gallon but like I

249
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,860
would call it a one gallon pot and one

250
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,719
what are you using for fertilizer I

251
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,700
could imagine you're probably not doing

252
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,060
Organics probably doing uh you have like

253
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,180
a synthetic lineup to choosing yes so

254
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:51,239
for this run I'm using Mills

255
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,439
um I've used plenty of other bottled

256
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,659
nutrients

257
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,220
um you know slow release dry amendments

258
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,319
Organics uh

259
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,200
they all work at the end of the day when

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,200
we use them properly but uh it's I would

261
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,120
say for me I kind of prefer Organics

262
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,100
over the bottled nutrients if I'm gonna

263
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,620
pick between the two just the ease of

264
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,060
use along with just you know kind of

265
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,860
feeling better about it at the end of

266
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,958
the day I come I come home to happy

267
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,060
healthy plants when I have Organics when

268
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,518
I'm dealing with synthetics I tend to do

269
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,958
something wrong or I over feed or if

270
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,080
something goes wrong and then I end up

271
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,759
with issues but um that's on me more

272
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,500
than the nutrient company you know I'd

273
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,799
say the nutrients themselves are great

274
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,559
it's just uh for ease of use Organics is

275
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,199
what I kind of really like to do more so

276
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,759
the Mills line up the juicy grain now is

277
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,519
it tell us a little bit more about it is

278
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,500
it there's like an A and B for veg and a

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,720
and b for flour and then is there

280
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,659
additives that you're using as well

281
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,660
right so uh there's only an A and A B

282
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:53,458
and use the same A and B for veg and for

283
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,980
flower just for flour you would increase

284
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,479
the ppms of that

285
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,339
um there's a few different additives

286
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,399
like they have a silica additive called

287
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,899
vitalize it's a monocacylic acid so it's

288
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,820
you know you know it's good stuff it's

289
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,860
going to be ready for the plants to use

290
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,278
right away

291
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,860
um they have a veg additive it's called

292
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,679
start R

293
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,220
this nitrogen huge nitrogen boost kind

294
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,019
of lean the NPK towards veg and then in

295
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,480
flour for

296
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,940
the first two or three weeks you're

297
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,278
using the start are still and then after

298
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,920
that you would switch over to their C4

299
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,439
for the next three weeks or so and then

300
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,659
the final three weeks you're using

301
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,519
um an additive called ultimate PK which

302
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,679
is just a huge phosphorous potassium

303
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,940
boost just right at the end right when

304
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,278
they need it

305
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,079
but yeah that's pretty much all the

306
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,519
bottles they have for it okay so they

307
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,139
have a feeding chart that you're

308
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
following but I assume you're doing like

309
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,639
a reduced dosage throughout or you're

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
doing a full dose

311
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,899
um so the way they have their feed chart

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,200
set up they have a light mix medium mix

313
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:05,220
and a heavier mix for this run I went

314
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,620
with the light feed mix and pretty much

315
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,500
went issue free for almost the whole

316
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,620
grow I would say around week four or

317
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,419
five when I switched over to their C4 I

318
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,360
started having some problems I think

319
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:22,919
that it was a probably

320
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,139
a phosphorus toxicity which led to a

321
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,819
magnesium deficiency in some of the

322
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,338
plants just like it was just too much

323
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,260
light

324
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,480
the main problem for me in this tent was

325
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,759
nine plants and a two by two is just

326
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,320
it's too many plants for me personally

327
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,958
like I just wanted to see what would

328
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,879
happen more than anything else but I

329
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,679
think that I would have done much better

330
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,600
if it would have been just one or two

331
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,000
plants in the same space in the same

332
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,220
time versus doing nine plants you know

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,500
you have to keep nine different plants

334
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,540
healthy and happy versus keeping one or

335
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,039
two plants healthy and happy in the same

336
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,539
space you know I just end up with an

337
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,000
easier time I was going to ask you how

338
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,799
many plants were in that nine one gallon

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,019
containers in a two by two that's what

340
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,659
you're doing right now yeah insane right

341
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,519
it's uh wow it was uh it was a little

342
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,620
bit of an overzealous challenge now I've

343
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,659
always kind of tried to keep it to one

344
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,299
plant per square foot is the max I

345
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,399
really want to do but I thought you know

346
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,019
I've seen places I've worked for do it

347
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,360
this way where they'll throw you know

348
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,860
this many in such a small space and I

349
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
just wanted to see what would happen and

350
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,519
sure enough I ran into some problems you

351
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,338
know just because you just

352
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,560
having nine smaller plants there's just

353
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,600
no way I can get them to take that much

354
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,338
light in the same way that I could if it

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,659
was one plant right because you figure

356
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,240
if you have

357
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,100
nine plants with four branches each of

358
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,539
those four branches can only take a

359
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,500
certain amount of light versus having

360
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:48,120
one plant with 36 branches now all 36 of

361
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,159
those branches can absorb all of that

362
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,740
light so I'll end up with a better

363
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,838
overall final product I would think yeah

364
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,680
it definitely comes with its own set of

365
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,320
challenges running more smaller plants

366
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,539
in that grow Space versus one or two

367
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,820
larger plants in that gross base I think

368
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,500
there's pros and cons to both in my

369
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,660
opinion I think one of the things is

370
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,578
kind of getting into the grotent water

371
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:13,620
right I don't know if you have an auto

372
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:16,500
watering system or if you're doing hand

373
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,120
watering it's a hand water system uh I

374
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,740
have a little little cup that I would

375
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,778
just kind of reach in there luckily it's

376
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,940
a small 10 so my arms can reach back

377
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,220
there and I keep the bottoms of my

378
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,600
plants pretty well pruned so I don't

379
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,940
have to worry about breaking any

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,100
branches down there but it's definitely

381
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,779
an ordeal and it's gotten me to think

382
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,120
man if I would have had an auto watering

383
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,700
system I probably would had a lot easier

384
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,839
time there but once again I think that

385
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,519
if I was going to do any kind of

386
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,220
automatic system in there it'd probably

387
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,519
either be living organic soil with some

388
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,620
blue mat drippers or an auto pot you

389
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
know and at that point I can really only

390
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,060
do one plant in there so that might be

391
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,880
for the next Rhonda or even a flood

392
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,619
drain would be a potential for that yeah

393
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,600
yeah so that's what you're doing right

394
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,578
now you said it's an experiment what's

395
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,079
kind of your ideal State like what have

396
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,059
you done before have you done just one

397
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,739
or two plants in there before like what

398
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,299
in your opinion is the ideal state for

399
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,039
maximizing yield would you just do one

400
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,859
plant would you do a couple plants or

401
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,599
what for maximizing a yield I think that

402
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,120
one plant like I was saying is probably

403
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,699
my best route simply just because I can

404
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,980
have one large healthy plant absorb a

405
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,500
lot more light a lot more nutrients and

406
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,659
probably cycle through water faster than

407
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,100
I could having nine different plants and

408
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,019
you know you know each plant's an

409
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,459
individuals so you're gonna have a

410
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,959
problem on this one and you're not gonna

411
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,939
have a problem on this one and you end

412
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,119
up having to adjust the feed that way or

413
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,980
you can just not worry about it and let

414
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,159
the round finish and try and just learn

415
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,139
from that but I think for me next round

416
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,078
one plant's going to be a lot better in

417
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,600
terms of overall yield because the way I

418
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:54,359
I gauge my yield is the shape of my

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,019
canopy the the cubic dimensions of it

420
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,000
right I want about two vertical feet and

421
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,339
then the entire area of my grow tent

422
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,339
filled for for maximizing my yield right

423
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,139
like if I have a two by two space so I

424
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,720
need

425
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,899
what is that eight square feet or eight

426
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,720
cubic feet of canopy space so I can do

427
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,940
that with nine plants and I could do

428
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,560
that with one plant it just depends on

429
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,139
you know obviously if the one plant

430
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,479
might take a little longer to veg that

431
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,180
amount of time but I think it's worth it

432
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,579
if I have only one tent right if I only

433
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:33,000
have 110 then I'm only vegging in and

434
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,919
flowering in that same space so if I

435
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,379
have a separate space to veg that one

436
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,319
plant for even if right now my current

437
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,360
veg setup is just a single T5 light that

438
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,579
I have underneath my desk and I just

439
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,379
throw plants under there just to you

440
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,419
know keep them alive and growing a

441
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,399
little bit at a time while I have my

442
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,860
flowering tent up and running okay so

443
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,679
one plant in a two by two and then what

444
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,959
would be the ideal pot size for that for

445
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,078
ideal pot size I mean

446
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,638
I would say for a two by two

447
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,438
I don't really want to put anything

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,660
larger than a two gallon in there

449
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,740
because I mean I know with a three

450
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,120
gallon I could probably fill I don't

451
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,039
know maybe a three by three or a four by

452
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,818
four with a single plant given the right

453
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,980
amount of time and and whatnot and

454
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,240
once again you know going back to you

455
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,338
know my current setup I've got nine

456
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,160
plants in there nine one gallon pots

457
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:27,838
that's nine gallons of media right if I

458
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,759
have one two gallon pot that's two

459
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,798
gallons of media it's not two gallons of

460
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,319
media is gonna obviously dry out a lot

461
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,879
faster than nine gallons of media and

462
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,279
it's also going to put a lot less stress

463
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,720
on my exhaust system right the fans

464
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,220
aren't going to have to pull as much

465
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,140
moisture out of the air if there isn't

466
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,298
as much moisture being dumped into the

467
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,640
room through the soil

468
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:49,379
so I I would say for me like like I said

469
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,600
the the next round I have is going to be

470
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,400
just one single Gorilla Glue plant and I

471
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,859
have it in a two gallon pot right now I

472
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,419
just threw it in maybe a week ago

473
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:01,019
um my current run is going to be chopped

474
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,600
on Monday or Tuesday so hopefully by

475
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,599
that time this plant that I have ready

476
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,119
to go will only need to be vegged for

477
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,859
you know a few days or so before I can

478
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,719
flip it to flowers that way you know I

479
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:15,359
want to keep a quicker cycle if I can

480
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,038
but you know I also want to have the

481
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,979
most yield I can get out of that space

482
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,259
so if I have to veg a little longer I

483
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,700
will yeah I think individual goals

484
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,019
definitely come into play I mean there's

485
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,700
so many different ways to go about this

486
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,679
you had mentioned it you would go with a

487
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,720
two gallon one two gallon plant in that

488
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,340
two by two space I know people who are

489
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,380
running you know five gallon one five

490
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,359
gallon net space one seven gallon that

491
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,620
space one ten gallon that space you're

492
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,779
doing the synthetics I know there's

493
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,918
people who's running Organics so there

494
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,399
are so many different ways you can kind

495
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:48,120
of go about it when it comes to pot size

496
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,740
media inputs so on and so forth so yeah

497
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,798
it's really interesting to hear your

498
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,720
your experience there and what you would

499
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,879
say is ideal for that one the other

500
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,620
thing I didn't ask about was sugar is it

501
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,380
using any sugars like a lot of people

502
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,439
use molasses or any microbial inoculants

503
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,120
or any other inputs uh so far as sugars

504
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,080
or middle acids nothing like that at the

505
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,599
moment

506
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,879
um even when I was doing the Organics I

507
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,119
I didn't do any kind of compost teas or

508
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,980
anything like that not opposed I just uh

509
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,619
I'm in an apartment so it's kind of

510
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,740
harder for me to have a tea Brewer set

511
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:24,479
up or you know anything like that but um

512
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,160
yeah it's all good stuff especially you

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,019
know if you're in Organics you know you

514
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,480
can add some sugars and just feed your

515
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,038
microbes keep the you know turnover rate

516
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,319
going

517
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,660
um as far as my cryrobial inoculants

518
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,899
that I'm using I'm using uh

519
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,360
stream gardening mycos it's the water

520
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,700
soluble one

521
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,459
I really only use it to kind of like

522
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,620
flush my media

523
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,720
like as in almost like a transition

524
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,219
you know like if I was about to flip the

525
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,200
flower and it's like I didn't know I was

526
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,000
feeding a bunch of veg nutrients I might

527
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,798
hit it with some mycos plain water

528
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,660
before it flips that way it's like I get

529
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,339
most of that you know excess nitrogen

530
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
out and can start with the flowering

531
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,819
nutrients but

532
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,160
then again you know some people say you

533
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,079
know or I guess it's proven now that the

534
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,900
plant wants nitrogen maybe for the first

535
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,659
three weeks or so so it's probably less

536
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,580
beneficial than I would think but yeah I

537
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,500
like to use microbes and you know

538
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,418
especially in Organics you know it's

539
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,160
pretty much that's what you need in

540
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,259
Organics you know you gotta have the

541
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,240
worker bees in there breaking down the

542
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,298
Organics and just feeding the plant it's

543
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,400
a beautiful cycle yep very true

544
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:35,279
okay so we talked about your grow tent

545
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,340
setup we talked about what you use for

546
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,839
inputs talk about pot size uh I guess

547
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,699
one thing I didn't ask about was like

548
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,959
transplanting are you just planting

549
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,759
directly into those one gallon

550
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,798
containers or are you starting in like a

551
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,779
solo cup and then transplanting up like

552
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,960
how do you do your transplants and then

553
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:54,599
after that we'll get into trainings you

554
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,000
know what you do for plant training okay

555
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,759
um so far as transplants go

556
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,900
um the current run I had started out in

557
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:07,079
small uh eight ounce styrofoam cups

558
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,580
they're very small right I really wish I

559
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,678
would have started them in Solo cups I

560
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,259
probably would have ran into less issues

561
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,259
with a larger pop there

562
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,359
um the way I go about transplanting is

563
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,359
uh I kind of like to look at the plant

564
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:24,479
from the top down and if I can still see

565
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,639
any of the soil then I'm I'm not ready

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,679
to transplant but if I can't see the pot

567
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,380
or the cup at all then I know it's

568
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,538
probably ready for it so you transplant

569
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,580
up you get to your final container what

570
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:37,859
do you do for trainings when do you do

571
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,379
the trainings and then when you stop the

572
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,399
trainings that you do okay so for

573
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,820
training

574
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,679
um I would say this in an earlier

575
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,779
part of the grow you know if we're in

576
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,240
the Solo Cup I'm pretty much just

577
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,740
topping with occasionally I might do

578
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,798
some super cropping I might bend a

579
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,640
branch if it's really tall and lanky

580
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,359
um

581
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,820
for veg mostly just low stress training

582
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,339
or you know scrog I might use the net to

583
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,918
kind of keep my branches low and wide I

584
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:10,139
really want my plant to be as low and as

585
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,120
wide as I can possibly get it before I

586
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,840
flour it

587
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,058
um

588
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,399
topping works really well for that just

589
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,918
because you know you can decide how many

590
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,559
branches do I want each plant or my

591
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,860
current plant to have in general right

592
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,980
I want to have one top with about seven

593
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,500
nodes in each of my trellis holes in a

594
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,500
two by two you know that's 16 tops give

595
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,119
or take so if I can if I can get 16 Tops

596
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,000
on one plant and they all have about

597
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,158
five to seven nodes that's a perfect

598
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,720
canopy to start flour with in my opinion

599
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,600
so you're trying to get up to those 16

600
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,600
different tops or or branches to fill up

601
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,418
each one of those individual holes on

602
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,219
the trellis net when do you put up the

603
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,960
trellis nut like how many days are you

604
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,460
vegging for and when you like put up the

605
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,919
trellis nut and then what is the height

606
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,200
from the trellis net to the like the top

607
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,240
of the grill pot well

608
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,220
in terms of the height of the trellis

609
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,558
net I mean that's going to depend on on

610
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,620
your space right in my situation with

611
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,359
the 55 inches of vertical space right I

612
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,579
have about five inches at the top was

613
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,439
where my light is and it has to be hung

614
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,019
a certain distance from the canopy so

615
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,259
I'd say about 15 inches from the from

616
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,960
the light to the canopy and I want about

617
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,579
two feet of canopy which leaves me with

618
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,159
like about I don't know four and a half

619
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:32,038
inches of of leg that I can have when I

620
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,600
have seven inch tall pots so so vertical

621
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,519
space is what I'm always fighting in

622
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,119
such a small space

623
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,579
um

624
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,500
so my trellis net uh

625
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,720
I kind of I for this current run I

626
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,240
played with it right so I started it out

627
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,400
low at about 10 and a half inches

628
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,038
because I knew okay this is as high as I

629
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,500
want my legs to be so I just made sure

630
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,298
that before I flipped none of the

631
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,000
branches were really going above the net

632
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:59,759
I just wanted to keep it all even and

633
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,819
then once I had the full area filled the

634
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,379
full two by two fold I let them stretch

635
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,240
up a little bit to get some vertical

636
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,880
length right because I wanted

637
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,679
some canopy to start with about you know

638
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,460
six or seven inches of canopy to start

639
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,120
with

640
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,460
and so once I flipped I just moved the

641
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,839
net up above the plants so that they

642
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,960
would have to grow and stretch up into

643
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,558
it again and that worked out pretty good

644
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,720
um

645
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,759
like I said you know they stretch mostly

646
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,960
during the first three weeks so during

647
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,480
those first three weeks man they're

648
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,679
stretching about an inch a day just you

649
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
know I started out with a 10 and a half

650
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,460
inch tall plant and right now they're

651
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,120
sitting just under 36 inches

652
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,100
you know so I mean it was pretty close

653
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,019
um the main thing I like to do too is

654
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,899
once I'm done with that first initial

655
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,139
three weeks I like to take you know some

656
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,880
kind of tie and tie any runaway tops or

657
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,159
taller branches I like to tie them

658
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,500
directly to the net just to where

659
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,900
they're even with the other you know

660
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,419
colas in the canopies that way you know

661
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,179
I want the most even canopy I can get so

662
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,038
that we don't have any one bud pulling

663
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,500
more light than the other or shading out

664
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,960
the others if I can avoid that got it so

665
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,900
after flipping the flower that stretch

666
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,298
period you know two three weeks you're

667
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,919
probably making constant adjustments to

668
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:20,158
make sure some of the tops aren't

669
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,020
dominating others right right right if

670
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,700
you see one that's you know going up

671
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,798
here and this other one's over here you

672
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,200
might pull this one to the next trellis

673
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,000
hole over just to lower it a little bit

674
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,360
trying to keep it as even as possible

675
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,640
but you know life happens sometimes it

676
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,798
gets away from us all but it's gonna be

677
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,900
okay because even if you get one random

678
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,220
top that's you know way taller than the

679
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,380
others that's where our friends super

680
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,600
cropping comes in and we can just bend

681
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,360
and break if we need to we never want to

682
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,599
but if we have to we will that makes

683
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,178
sense now defoliating or lollipopping do

684
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,439
you do either one of those things 100 I

685
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,500
do both

686
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,840
um so far as lollipopping goes I really

687
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,619
like to only do it in week one of flower

688
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,538
just to kind of initiate that stretch

689
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:08,699
I'll I'll lollipop pretty aggressively

690
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:11,099
usually like I'll go almost to the top

691
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,400
node top three nodes Max

692
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:15,778
and uh I've noticed you know that's it's

693
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,640
kind of like the plants like ah what's

694
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:21,359
attacking me down here I better grow up

695
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,679
here and it really just induces that

696
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,139
stretch you know and that's that's what

697
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,940
I'm looking for in flower generally I I

698
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,640
like to start with a smaller plant and

699
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,320
finish with a medium-sized plant versus

700
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,000
starting with a medium-sized plant and

701
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,038
finishing with you know I don't want my

702
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,839
tops to be too close to the light that

703
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,119
makes sense I know there are quite a few

704
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,220
folks that are just tuning in on podcast

705
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,319
platforms and even the folks that are on

706
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,120
YouTube you're trying to get a visual of

707
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,158
how you do things but you do have an

708
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,959
Instagram which I'll be sure to link

709
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,120
down in the YouTube description section

710
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,400
below and then folks can go there and

711
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,219
click on there and actually see what

712
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,480
your setup is how you do it because uh

713
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,579
you've got a ton of pictures on there

714
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,839
that clearly show exactly what you're

715
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:03,480
talking about so I figured I'd mention

716
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,538
that one right now okay so you've done

717
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,200
your lollipopping defoliating you've got

718
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:11,519
your plants in the net spread out

719
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,319
maximizing the stretches done and after

720
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,759
that's just flowering just kind of

721
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,939
getting through the flowering period

722
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:21,179
just feeding as you need to watering as

723
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,880
you need to and so on and so forth right

724
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,340
right uh I forgot to say about uh

725
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,799
defoliation so

726
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:31,798
um there's a book I'm sure you've heard

727
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:35,278
of it uh three of light and they do uh

728
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,440
they do defoliation day 21 day 42 and

729
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,900
I've kind of tried it and it's worked

730
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,600
very well for me so I I always do those

731
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,320
defoliation days I do just like they say

732
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,719
I take off every single fan leaf larger

733
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,579
fan Leaf especially uh anything blocking

734
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,519
the light I really just want to maximize

735
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:55,379
light penetration through you know the

736
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,839
certain amount of canopy that I have you

737
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,400
know if I only have two feet of canopy

738
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,678
to work with I got to make sure I have a

739
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,038
light that will penetrate that two feet

740
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,900
that way my bottoms aren't looking as

741
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,640
bad as they could you know I've had it

742
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,200
happen where you know you don't get any

743
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
light down here and you end up with the

744
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,700
Fluffy popcorn bud and but you know at

745
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,980
the end of the day we want the good

746
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,019
tasty sticky colas that you get at the

747
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,700
top yeah absolutely I think with the

748
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,558
method that you explained especially

749
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,500
when doing lollipopping you get rid of a

750
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:29,099
lot of that lar fret and uh you know the

751
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,460
the from the net upwards is usually hard

752
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:34,139
buds that's the goal that's the goal

753
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,778
I want to take it back and bring it back

754
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,000
to water what are you using for a water

755
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:41,700
source

756
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,720
ah so like I said I'm in an apartment so

757
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:49,558
my my tap water is it's okay it's like

758
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,600
240 something ppms pretty high so um

759
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,579
normally I would never ever use anything

760
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,139
like that I have before and you know you

761
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,859
get mixed results

762
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,200
um

763
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,879
currently I'm going across the street I

764
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,400
have a Rite Aid and they have a little

765
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,320
water dispensing machine out there so

766
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,960
for like two bucks I get a five gallon

767
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,079
bottle and I've checked the ppms and

768
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,200
we're like 12 to 5 to 12 ppms which is

769
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,699
like nothing so it's very very clean uh

770
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,798
so that's what I'm using for water right

771
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,600
now yeah that's the reverse osmosis

772
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,119
technology is yeah because I have the

773
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,158
same thing there's water stations you

774
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,599
get and it's about the same PPM very

775
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:30,659
very low right do you monitor the pH of

776
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:34,439
the medium at all or your initial water

777
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:37,140
source if so what do you aim for

778
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,880
um so far as the media goes uh currently

779
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm not monitoring it I don't I don't

780
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,159
check my runoff or I have a meter that

781
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,278
checks it but it's kind of hit and miss

782
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,080
you know uh I do monitor it whenever I

783
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,679
water or feed

784
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,480
um

785
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,659
the way I kind of do it is I'll check

786
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,759
the ppms of the plain water before I add

787
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,278
any nutrients and then each bottle that

788
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,200
I add I check the ppms and the pH

789
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,179
afterwards just to kind of see how it

790
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,200
affects it

791
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,500
um

792
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,538
but yeah yeah I monitor it but uh I'm

793
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,599
not super concerned with it like I'm

794
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:16,740
more concerned with the EC PPM or TDS

795
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:18,480
over the pH now the pH to me is more

796
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,940
important than like a true hydroponic

797
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,159
system where you know if you're in if

798
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,440
you reach are constantly suspended in

799
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,360
the water or constantly being having

800
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,519
water run over them then pH is probably

801
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,918
more more important because you know

802
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,379
that really affects how much nutrients

803
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,899
you're going to be able to uptake

804
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,100
whereas in a media situation I feel like

805
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:39,898
you end up

806
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,459
not having to worry about pH as much

807
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,619
just because the plants produce those

808
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,079
exudates that can adjust the environment

809
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:48,479
accordingly to what the plant wants so

810
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,418
if I just keep it in range you know

811
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,019
within I usually aim for five eight to

812
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,940
six two for my for cocoa at least in

813
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,319
Organics I don't I don't check pH or

814
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,419
worry about it at all because I know

815
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,220
that there's stuff in the soil that's

816
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,919
pretty much going to adjust the pH to

817
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,298
what it needs to be at anyways but for

818
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,340
Cocoa I know it's a little more

819
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:10,319
important so I try and just make sure

820
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,500
that when it's about to get watered in

821
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,480
it's got to be five eight

822
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,519
temperature is important to like I don't

823
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,220
want it to be too cold like any colder

824
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,918
than 68 degrees is too cold and any

825
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,380
warmer than 80 degrees is probably a

826
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,919
little too warm so I usually try and

827
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,140
keep it 70 to 75 degrees

828
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,980
um and obviously like I'm saying EC is

829
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,600
more important to me than pH uh I really

830
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,179
try and monitor

831
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,058
what I'm putting in and at what times

832
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:44,460
right you know you can't I can't feed a

833
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:46,200
plant that's you know smaller you know

834
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,880
like a fresh clone I can't feed it the

835
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,558
same way that I would feed a plant

836
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,260
that's you know a week away from being

837
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,658
chopped down so you know you got to know

838
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:59,038
what you're feeding that so on Coco 5 8

839
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:04,260
5.8 to 6.2 pH going in ignore the runoff

840
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:05,819
and then for PPM or EC are you doing are

841
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,740
you monitoring the runoff for that or is

842
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,658
it just what you're putting in like what

843
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,019
your nutrient mixes that you're putting

844
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,640
in yeah I only monitor it going in like

845
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,278
the only time I'm ever going to check my

846
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,799
runoff is if I'm having a problem really

847
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:23,278
if I'm if I'm noticing one plant has

848
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:25,379
some sort of you know burn or or just a

849
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,839
look to it I'll I might check the the

850
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,700
runoff to that but normally if I have

851
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,740
any kind of nutrient burn I'm just going

852
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,600
to flush that plant just for that week

853
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,359
I'll just not give it any nutrients just

854
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,099
hit it with some plain pH water or even

855
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,139
that and sometimes that's a good time to

856
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,759
use a microbe you know if you have some

857
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,200
mycose and you know you have a plant

858
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,240
that's struggling you can hit it with

859
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,340
some mycose and it might help eat up

860
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,798
whatever built up salts are in the media

861
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:51,480
to you know hopefully get it back on

862
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,759
track you mentioned the feeding chart

863
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,298
that you follow earlier do you know

864
00:32:53,759 --> 00:33:01,019
offhand what the ECS are going in

865
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:02,038
uh not the EC offhand

866
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:05,158
um

867
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,679
I know that for my my most recent

868
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,159
feeding I gave them a very light dose it

869
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,679
was like 300 ppms that was my final

870
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,700
feeding and my next watering here should

871
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,140
be

872
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,640
tomorrow or maybe tonight

873
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,740
it's going to be just plain water I do

874
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,299
flush

875
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,980
forced habit I don't know you know we've

876
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:28,500
heard both ways that it's beneficial or

877
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,380
non-beneficial I like to do it I just

878
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,480
noticed that it really does help with uh

879
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,940
kind of bringing out some color along

880
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,740
with just you know peace of mind I just

881
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,120
it might not work that way where it's

882
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,278
you know I know I'm not flushing

883
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,079
anything out of the plant but if the

884
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,119
plant doesn't have anything else to eat

885
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,918
it's going to start eating itself which

886
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,898
is you know senescence I'm trying to

887
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,360
push that towards the end of flower so

888
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:55,199
so we talked about plant training we

889
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:57,058
talked about nutrition to very important

890
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,278
things when it comes to maximizing yield

891
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:01,200
let's get into environment that

892
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,058
certainly can impact the amount of yield

893
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,058
that you get you know if your

894
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,980
environment temperature humidity CO2 are

895
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:10,440
in a whack you could see a significant

896
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,480
stunt growth so let's break it down one

897
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,858
by one what temperature do you typically

898
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,579
aim for

899
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:21,898
for temperature uh in my grow tent and I

900
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:23,460
I like to keep it under 80 above 70 if I

901
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,219
can

902
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,780
um I've had it go up you know 86 in

903
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,219
there and you don't have a lot of

904
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,560
problems as long as you're you know kind

905
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:35,039
of closer to the beginning of flower or

906
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,619
in veg but towards the end of flower I

907
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,199
do like to keep it a little cooler

908
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,599
um right now I have it aimed for 70 to

909
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,579
75 degrees

910
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,740
um I don't have an AC in there obviously

911
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,319
it's a two by two so I just use my my

912
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,358
Apartments Central AC and that does

913
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,740
enough to where I keep it pretty cool in

914
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,199
there and don't have to worry too much

915
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,838
about the temps and then humidity what

916
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,980
do you typically aim for for RH

917
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,779
uh for veg uh as high as I can get it in

918
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,019
there I like to keep it pretty high you

919
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:11,160
know 70 to 60 is pretty ideal for me in

920
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:14,579
terms of veg uh for flour uh

921
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:16,199
I'll keep it 60 to 50 is about where I

922
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,320
want it anywhere in that range is

923
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,239
usually pretty safe

924
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,720
and then when I chop the plant I try and

925
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:27,118
keep the 60 and 60 60

926
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,578
percent humidity and 60 degrees if I can

927
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,460
but um a little warmer than that's

928
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:34,920
obviously not a huge issue but just uh

929
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,420
in that range is good for me so if I'm

930
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,159
remembering correctly I'm pretty sure

931
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,980
what you mentioned as far as temperature

932
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,139
humidity Falls within the the ideal VPD

933
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,539
range right you've got the the green I

934
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:47,519
know how much you know about VPD but uh

935
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,559
you've got the green optimal range for

936
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,900
VPD then you've got the yellow which is

937
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,880
kind of like the tolerance range for VPD

938
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,940
and then the red which is kind of out of

939
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,099
range and I think what you mentioned uh

940
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,720
lines up with the optimal range or at

941
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,619
least in the tolerance range so you're

942
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,019
probably getting some really good plant

943
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,640
growth there uh and certainly staying

944
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:07,079
within that VPD range I mean that's

945
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,940
going to help maximize growth right it's

946
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,019
going to help maximize your overall

947
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,280
yield definitely vpu is very important

948
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:16,800
um I know that obviously if your

949
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,420
environment you're if your environment's

950
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,220
off at all you know it can throw off the

951
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,780
way your plant eats which if your

952
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,980
plant's not eating all the food that

953
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,720
you're getting it you could have a

954
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,579
buildup in your medium which could have

955
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,639
you know lead to more problems in the

956
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,400
cation exchange right so it really is

957
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,000
important and environment's key

958
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,740
um

959
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,179
the better environment that you can

960
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,578
create for the plant the better plant

961
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:41,039
growth you'll get but that doesn't mean

962
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,019
that we can't get decent plant growth

963
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,820
out of them less than ideal situation

964
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:47,219
you know the plants are very resilient

965
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,320
and they can you know do things to their

966
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,659
environment to affect what they need but

967
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,240
there is a limit right you know you can

968
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:56,759
definitely kill a plant with uh you know

969
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,319
a bad environment I've done it where you

970
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,300
know you let the tent get a little too

971
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,980
warm or you know when I first got into

972
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,720
this I didn't know like that you should

973
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,980
have a fan exhausting the air out you

974
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,019
know I just threw a light in there and

975
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,579
just hoped it would be fine but I was

976
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,800
like oh it's a T5 it won't do anything

977
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,660
bad I'm not going to burn my plants but

978
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,680
you can burn your plants with c5s if you

979
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,440
don't have any air exchange I'll

980
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,419
guarantee you that I fried the crap out

981
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,039
of seedlings before when I first started

982
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,800
growing because I read on a forum the

983
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,199
more light the better which was not true

984
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,539
at all especially with an HID grow light

985
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,219
uh burnt the crap out and completely

986
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,539
kill them so it's like

987
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,759
um no

988
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,920
yeah that's the thing that's what they

989
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,960
say you know every uh every piece of

990
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,079
equipment works as long as you use it

991
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,780
correctly but it's very easy to misuse

992
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,579
any piece right you know you can do have

993
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,560
the most perfect environment but then

994
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,599
you know if you're overfeeding or you're

995
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,039
over watering or you're you know you're

996
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,019
topped at the wrong time or something

997
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,699
and now the plant has to recover longer

998
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,380
you know you can run into problems any

999
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:57,358
Any Which Way But

1000
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,099
I think the best thing to do is to

1001
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,880
remember hey I'm only going to be with

1002
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:04,500
this plant for 90 days max right so like

1003
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,358
as long if I have a problem with this

1004
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,179
plant hey I just kind of let it go

1005
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,400
unless it's something I can fix now if

1006
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:13,559
not then just worry about it the next

1007
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,480
run man I think that's my best bet is to

1008
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,219
keep my my stress levels down because

1009
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,980
it's very easy when you're passionate

1010
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:22,559
about these plants to let it get to you

1011
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,539
and stress you out but I I think that

1012
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,578
the happier I am the happier my plants

1013
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:27,779
generally are for some reason so well

1014
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,720
said

1015
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,480
CO2 one of those things where it's just

1016
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,000
study after study after study proving

1017
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,699
that increased levels of CO2 helps

1018
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,460
increase biomass are you doing anything

1019
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:43,019
to supplement CO2 in the environment at

1020
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,400
all or no

1021
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:48,239
uh

1022
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,420
not necessarily as I was saying I do use

1023
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,159
microbes and microbes breathe out CO2 so

1024
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,559
to some level I guess there's a little

1025
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,799
bit of CO2 supplementation through that

1026
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,659
but as far as like uh you know the

1027
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,700
canisters or the mushroom bags or

1028
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:06,239
anything I haven't done that in that

1029
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,980
space I might do it in the 4x8 next but

1030
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,739
for right now I'm not and I'm not

1031
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,420
supplementing any CO2 but it is

1032
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:15,959
definitely you know you're going to get

1033
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,400
more yield when you when you use a CO2 I

1034
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,920
feel like there's only two real things

1035
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,400
that I can say that would increase your

1036
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,858
yield for sure and that's CO2 and a

1037
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,900
might a light mover light mover uh even

1038
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:30,480
in a two by two no I wouldn't use it in

1039
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,639
a two by two for my four by eight I was

1040
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,679
thinking about throwing a thousand watt

1041
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,559
onto a light mover so that way I can

1042
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,539
cover both four by four spaces with that

1043
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,179
one light and I might be able to pull

1044
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,980
you know more yield from one light in

1045
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,919
there than I would if I was to throw two

1046
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,079
600 watts in there or something

1047
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,760
interesting how about pest prevention we

1048
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,880
haven't talked about that yet a lot of

1049
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,800
people will do things to prevent pests

1050
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,800
from invading your grow space What do

1051
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,180
you do uh personally I've used a few

1052
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,820
different things

1053
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:03,858
um for Organics I really like insect

1054
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,480
grass

1055
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:08,519
just kind of helps to keep your plant

1056
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,559
you know the cell walls get more strong

1057
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,380
so they're less likely to be attacked

1058
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,480
along with just kind of uh the chitin in

1059
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,338
there kind of triggers a response in the

1060
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,260
plant to make it so that their defenses

1061
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:21,299
are up so that's kind of like a

1062
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,960
preventative uh if I'm dealing with

1063
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,660
Organics uh in terms of synthetics I

1064
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,699
really only use one product it's called

1065
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,719
plant therapy

1066
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,699
um

1067
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,739
I think it's got like

1068
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,719
some kind of rubbing alcohol and other

1069
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:39,358
mix in it I don't know what's in it but

1070
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,059
I once again I really only use that if I

1071
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,699
see like damage like if I see thrip

1072
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,980
damage or you know for some reason see a

1073
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:50,719
bug in there I'll spray them that day

1074
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,460
but I I try not to ever spray and flour

1075
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,259
and I really will only do it once in veg

1076
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,059
just to kind of you know peace of mind

1077
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,560
be like I just want to make sure hey I

1078
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:00,539
didn't see anything but I just want to

1079
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,400
have a clean slate when I go in flower

1080
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,619
so I don't have to deal with it in flour

1081
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,539
if you had any like major infestations

1082
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,800
would say like fungus gnats or spider

1083
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:13,920
mites or anything that you had to battle

1084
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,019
uh luckily in this 2x2 not yet I haven't

1085
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,159
had any major issues

1086
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,559
um

1087
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:22,980
I've had problems in the past with you

1088
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,900
know fungus gnats white flies

1089
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,420
um and some of the places I've worked at

1090
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,358
I've dealt with aphids or root aphids

1091
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,380
and you know broad mites rusted mites

1092
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,319
I've dealt with a lot of different

1093
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:38,338
things along with pathogens like pm and

1094
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,500
you know bud rot and all that but um

1095
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,139
yeah in my in my personal grow here at

1096
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,599
home now my plants are usually pretty

1097
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,358
sturdy and once they go into flower and

1098
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,220
I'm on the second story so it's like I

1099
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,838
don't have to worry about the things

1100
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,659
crawling into our house that way it's

1101
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:57,059
less likely so luckily I've I've been

1102
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,819
pretty pretty bug free in my tent lately

1103
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:01,559
so that's good to hear what other

1104
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,838
problems have you come across when

1105
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,599
growing in such a small space and what

1106
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,299
did you do to fix those problems uh uh

1107
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,740
small space problems really comes down

1108
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,960
to when we were talking about

1109
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,578
environment and um

1110
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,320
I think that's one of the things that

1111
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,780
I've learned from dealing with nine

1112
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,180
plants in the one space is that you have

1113
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,760
to water them all right and so putting a

1114
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:25,919
lot of extra humidity and moisture into

1115
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,960
the room and your fan is going to have

1116
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,119
to exhaust all of that so sometimes I've

1117
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,980
had less than ideal humidity ranges in

1118
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,260
there where it'll be you know a little

1119
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,719
bit out of the range I like but

1120
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,280
my usual fix is just open the tent let

1121
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,039
some fresh air get in there and it

1122
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,140
usually works pretty good but

1123
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,579
one of the other problems too of a small

1124
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:47,159
space obviously is the height

1125
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:49,800
restriction you know like I was looking

1126
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,379
at uh this gorilla glue or Gorilla Grow

1127
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,320
Tent that was uh I think it's a two by

1128
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,820
two and a half but it's like seven feet

1129
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,400
tall or something so I feel like

1130
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,079
something like that I would have way

1131
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,599
less problems with height issues you

1132
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,099
know because in this current row if I

1133
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,380
could have let the plants get just a

1134
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,940
little bit taller I probably would have

1135
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,200
gotten a much better yield and they

1136
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,720
probably would have been a lot healthier

1137
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:15,419
but because I had to flip it before it

1138
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,980
hits that certain height I ended up you

1139
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,180
know having to deal with a smaller plant

1140
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,099
but

1141
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,559
other than that I would say you know two

1142
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,539
by two space is great for if you're just

1143
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,299
a single home home grower you're only

1144
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:29,699
growing for yourself I think that you

1145
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,980
know four to five ounces every 90 days

1146
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:33,779
is a pretty good deal if you're you know

1147
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,599
buying it at the store and stuff you

1148
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,400
know you're spending what like 100 bucks

1149
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,760
on an ounce or something you know you

1150
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,980
figure but two by two tent setups like

1151
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,900
400 bucks if you get the you know the

1152
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,179
whole kit or something

1153
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,400
you know one cycle and you pretty much

1154
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:52,078
paid for your whole whole tent right

1155
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
there and you know and then every

1156
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,519
Harvest after that's just you know more

1157
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
more tree so you definitely get your

1158
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,960
money's worth growing your own

1159
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,579
uh heat issues have you had any of those

1160
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,380
that I feel like that's like the number

1161
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,539
one problem I feel like people growing

1162
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,519
in small spaces is they put these LED

1163
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:10,679
grow lights in there which some people

1164
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,019
put more more powerful than what they

1165
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,299
need and then then running into heat

1166
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:17,338
issues has that occur to you at all or

1167
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,780
like is your central air conditioner

1168
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,519
that you mentioned that you're using is

1169
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,800
that just completely mitigated

1170
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,079
uh it's definitely an issue

1171
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,318
um if I run the light that I have now at

1172
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:33,240
100 the hottest it really gets is like

1173
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:35,279
86. I mean that's deal withable but if I

1174
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,500
didn't have that ventilation system that

1175
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,200
checks the environment constantly with

1176
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,659
the little sensor like and I just had to

1177
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:45,299
rely on me being there then it's then

1178
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:46,679
it's more of an issue but that AC

1179
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,539
Infinity fan you know it makes

1180
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,519
everything so easy in terms of managing

1181
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:52,380
your environment that way with Temp and

1182
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,358
humidity

1183
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,980
um so far as lighting in in the space

1184
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,318
goes uh

1185
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,639
I I know that I've seen you know some of

1186
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,500
my favorite YouTubers do it where

1187
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,838
they'll throw a much more powerful light

1188
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,940
than the space can really take and I've

1189
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,099
seen good things come from it I've also

1190
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,358
seen bad things come from it so I mean I

1191
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,940
guess it's like

1192
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,338
you know roll the dice if you want but

1193
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,800
you know don't don't be mad if something

1194
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:19,858
bad happens right like uh

1195
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,019
I don't know even 150 watts seems like a

1196
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:24,838
little bit too much light for the two by

1197
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:26,159
two space uh I kind of almost wish I

1198
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,019
would have gone with the smaller model

1199
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,899
and just done 100 Watts I probably would

1200
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:32,460
have maybe ran into less issues but I

1201
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,260
was a little overzealous I was like I've

1202
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,960
got two extra inches to work with on

1203
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,119
either end I should be fine but

1204
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,800
you know we'll see you next next run

1205
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,260
when I only do the one plan I want to

1206
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,960
see if I can get it to take the full 150

1207
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,140
watts no problem and if I do that then I

1208
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,838
know I'll probably be okay but got it so

1209
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,159
I think we covered quite a bit of things

1210
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,119
that impact yield the only thing we

1211
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,460
really didn't talk about was the

1212
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,500
genetics right as number one uh you know

1213
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,179
get high yielding genetics to begin and

1214
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,159
that's going to help contribute towards

1215
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:03,779
a higher yield overall you know

1216
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,000
especially in a two by two grow space

1217
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,040
but uh is there any other advice or

1218
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,260
anything you can think of for those

1219
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,019
folks that are trying to maximize yield

1220
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,520
into two by two space

1221
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,500
uh yeah I would say the main thing for

1222
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:19,920
me

1223
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:23,219
uh just knowing your space right knowing

1224
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,079
how much height you have to deal with in

1225
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:26,759
terms of how how high is my light able

1226
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,519
to go in this space

1227
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,520
uh how far away do I have to keep that

1228
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:35,639
light from the canopy and then I will

1229
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:39,139
like I said I want about two cubic feet

1230
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:41,460
of canopy at any one time

1231
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:43,618
to get the maximum yield I would say

1232
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,019
right the most you can really do is

1233
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,599
three feet three cubic feet of canopy

1234
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:50,818
space but any more than that and I feel

1235
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,380
like he might end up burning your tops

1236
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:53,759
trying to light up the bottom and I

1237
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,338
don't want to do that

1238
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,040
so I tend to just try and keep it in

1239
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:02,460
that two foot of canopy range with maybe

1240
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,559
one to one and a half feet of leg to

1241
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,480
support it

1242
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,639
um so that that's my plant that I want

1243
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,740
right that's like the ideal plant shape

1244
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,159
and size or canopy shape and size that I

1245
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:16,379
want for any space so I just recreate

1246
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,598
that in a two by two space you know if

1247
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,599
uh if you're in a three by three you

1248
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,880
know you want 18 cubic feet if you're in

1249
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,700
a four by four you want 32 cubic feet of

1250
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,140
canopy and that should be the about

1251
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,539
where you want it if you want to get

1252
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:32,699
your maximum yield all right good stuff

1253
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,679
so let's wrap things up tell us how can

1254
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:36,480
the listeners find you and what do you

1255
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,578
have upcoming in the future I don't know

1256
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,240
well you can find me on Instagram right

1257
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:44,400
now that's my main social media Outlet I

1258
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,919
also have a YouTube I don't really have

1259
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,318
a lot of content it's more of just a

1260
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,079
video log at this moment

1261
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,940
I would like to do you know more videos

1262
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,039
like this in the future just you know I

1263
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,920
like I like to say it like this you know

1264
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,739
the only thing I like doing more than

1265
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,680
growing medicinal plants is talking

1266
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:06,059
about growing medicinal plants so I mean

1267
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,440
something like this is awesome just

1268
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:09,239
getting to talk to other people about

1269
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,639
it's always a joy

1270
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:14,578
so uh I don't know I'm just gonna keep

1271
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,578
letting it happen uh hopefully social

1272
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:19,500
media will do well for me and I can make

1273
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:22,019
some good connections and just keep

1274
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,838
talking to people about this and

1275
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,400
yeah just excited for the future awesome

1276
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:28,619
well like I mentioned earlier in the

1277
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,240

much for coming on this has been cool to

1292
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,019
talk about growing in a 2x2 and

1293
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,779
maximizing the space so I haven't grown

1294
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,338
a 2x2 but I do plan to eventually grow

1295
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,980
in a two by two right now I'm growing in

1296
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:06,179
a two by four and a four by four but a

1297
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,818
lot of the things that we mentioned

1298
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:11,639
today that you mentioned today can be

1299
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:13,380
taken and put into larger growth spaces

1300
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,059
as well so I think this is not only

1301
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,980
valuable to those smokes growing in

1302
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:18,838
small growth spaces but a lot of it does

1303
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,699
go towards larger growth spaces

1304
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,679
definitely yeah you gotta be able to

1305
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:24,598
scale it up if you can now absolutely

1306
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,460
alright peace out everyone catch you in

1307
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,818
the next episode thank you Chris have a

1308
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,818
