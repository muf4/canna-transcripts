34
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,919
in the description section below for the

35
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,759
part test i'm going to use the apogee

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,079
mq620 extended range par meter this

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
meter measures from 340 nanometers

38
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,599
to 1040 nanometers and the measurements

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
are in ppfd

40
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,719
and this part test is really just to

41
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
give you a general idea of what the par

42
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,840
output is

43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
it's not going to be 100 accurate i take

44
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
measurements in grow tents which have

45
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,879
reflective walls

46
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
that could increase in numbers this led

47
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,319
grow light is recommended for

48
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,239
side lighting they do list a coverage

49
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,959
area of two feet by four feet on their

50
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,239
website

51
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,319
so in this video i'm going to take par

52
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,039
measurements in a two foot by four foot

53
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,118
grow tent

54
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
like i showed you during the unboxing it

55
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,319
does come with a dimmer

56
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
i did not plug in the dimmer for this

57
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,679
part test so the light is operating at

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
full power

59
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
i'm gonna take measurements at three

60
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,000
different distances 12 inches

61
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,478
18 inches and 24 inches i've plugged the

62
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,478
x1 into my kilowatt meter and it shows

63
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,438
1.36 amps pulling 163 watts from the

64
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,478
wall

65
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,478
all right let's get into the

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
