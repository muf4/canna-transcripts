1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,160
coming up on garden talk if you had 100

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,120
uva photons for example and 100 blue

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,199
photons the uva photons would only view

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,119
then 20 as effective as the blue photon

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,439
i've tested maybe 100 grow lights in the

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,719
last two or three years i haven't seen

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,199
one whose spectrum wasn't suitable for

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,799
growing you can hack to

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,279
getting at the equivalent of a three

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
hundred dollar quantum sensor parameter

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,759
for in about twenty dollars twenty five

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,600
dollars compared to blue and green red

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
photons are more photosynthetically

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
efficient by about 10 or 15

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
people see the blues and the uvs and the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
far reds and these extra diodes and

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,799
think they add something all i see is

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,280
waste i see

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,159
money being put into stuff which is just

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
marketing trinkets and if you want more

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,519
growth get more power

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
what's up everybody if you that don't

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,640
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,118
and you're tuned into the garden talk

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,879
podcast this is episode number 33. in

26
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,599
this episode i interview shane from

27
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,399
micro led he is a lighting expert and he

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,000
owns micro led grow light company many

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
of you know him from his youtube channel

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
where he does grow light testing and

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,118
reviews he'll talk a little bit about

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
the grow light testing that he does and

33
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,200
we'll also get into other lighting

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,680
topics such as measuring par

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
light spectrum in significant detail and

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
the future of grow lights thanks to all

37
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,039

talk podcast today i am joined with

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
shane from my grill how you doing today

91
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,158
chris i'm doing very well thank you and

92
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,759
i'm really delighted to be on your show

93
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,759
thanks for joining me we're going to

94
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,560
dive deep into lighting today

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,399
particularly lighting for plants so i

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,158
actually already did a lighting in a

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,158
past podcast episode it was called

98
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,679
things to look for when buying an led

99
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,519
grow light it was really an led grow

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
light buyer's guide it was more of a

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,080
beginner friendly conversation that was

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
episode 18 with austin from chill tech

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
if any of you want to check it out i'll

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
actually have that in the outro card of

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,840
this video if you're watching on youtube

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
but this conversation's gonna be more

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
intermediate knowledge i'd say we're

108
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,798
gonna get into grow like testing we'll

109
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,238
talk about measuring par

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
we'll talk about light spectrum so we'll

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
go over the different colors on the

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,438
spectrum and how they impact plant

113
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,680
growth and then lastly the future of led

114
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,599
growth lights so before we get into the

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
nitty gritty of things can you tell us a

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
little bit about yourself and how you

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,478
got into lighting

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
yeah i've been have been

119
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,360
into growing for a long time so

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
horticultural background horticultural

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
parents

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
wife is into horticulture

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
and i'm an engineer manufacturing

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
engineer

125
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,799
so i was um i finished up with my

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
previous job i was working corporate

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,079
finished up and

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,638
wanted to look into doing something

129
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,599
myself and i sort of put two and two

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
together and came up with micro

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
so micro

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
we manufacture um

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
and sell our own range of grow lights

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
but we

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
as well of course we have the micro

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,280
youtube channel and instagram page

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
and uh yeah i've been running that for

138
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,439
about the last five years and you

139
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
currently have you're coming up on 70

140
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,439
000 subscribers on your youtube channel

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
so congrats to all your success there

142
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,519
that's not easy to do and on your

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
youtube channel you do a lot of grow

144
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,038
like testing can you talk to us about

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
the grow like testing you do and how you

146
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,800
measure grow light performance

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
yeah absolutely yes i originally started

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
doing grow light testing basically to

149
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
sell my own lights and it was to to

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,478
demonstrate the value of buying high

151
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,478
efficiency lights over

152
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,240
what a lot of the sort of

153
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,439
cheaper um

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,879
models were around at the time

155
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,879
particularly blurple lights this is

156
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,600
about four or five years ago

157
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,079
and kind of came up with a when i came

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,400
up with sort of refined i suppose

159
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,560
a method of testing which was um

160
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,120
getting the grow light in question

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,439
optimizing it for in terms of the area

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,038
that it's suited for optimizing in terms

163
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,759
of hanging height

164
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,599
simulating a grow tent environment so

165
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,439
silver molar walls

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,439
and then using what's called a quantum

167
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,560
sensor or a power sensor

168
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959
to measure

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,519
that across a grid hopefully you guys

170
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,318
will be now aware of power maps

171
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,318
basically a chart showing the

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
power intensity or the light intensity

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
all across the um the

174
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
sort of test area which represents the

175
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,759
plant canopy the leaf canopy

176
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,318
and yeah it became very popular

177
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
people really got um

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
got into

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
seeing um you know how their life

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,959
performed how some lights perform

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
against other lights

182
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,439
and i guess sort of demystifying as well

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
some of the

184
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,360
confusion and the misconceptions around

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
grow lighting so a couple of

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
measurements that you highlighted seems

187
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,478
are micro moles per watt and then also

188
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,639
the average par over the footprint so

189
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,199
why are those measurements kind of the

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,160
most important in your opinion

191
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,000
so

192
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
a grow light um

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,680
so if you take for example a hid bulb as

194
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,758
a starting point so hps bulb

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
hps bulbs fire out

196
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,199
light or photons in all directions

197
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,399
and you have to then use reflectors and

198
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
reflective walls in order to direct that

199
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,679
all that light back down onto the plant

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,160
canopy and often there are

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,360
um losses involved in that so if the

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,160
reflector isn't good quality reflector

203
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,960
and if the the

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,120
hanging height isn't optimized

205
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,598
all these sort of things feed into how

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,519
many la how much loss you have typically

207
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,279
with a hid reflector you've had anywhere

208
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,719
between about 15 and 25 losses

209
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,119
and so

210
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
it's not just about the amount of light

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
that's coming out of the fixture itself

212
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,079
this just pertains to led as well but

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,399
really it's about the system efficiency

214
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,478
so as i said when you have it in the

215
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,679
correct grow light environment so the

216
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,399
right size uh grow grow area with

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,918
reflective walls at the optimized height

218
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,839
what's the best system efficiency so

219
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,799
getting that how much power you're

220
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,279
getting down onto the plant canopy

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,439
and so that's what i measure

222
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,799
and then simply that's the so that's the

223
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
power output

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
kind of called it i've become to call it

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
usable ppf

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,639
or usable power um in the last couple

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,598
years

228
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
and so it's how much usable power or

229
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,439
power is reaching your plant canopy and

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
then you if you divide that by the power

231
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,559
consumed you get the efficiency of the

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,800
system

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,158
so it's the amount of output delivered

234
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,879
to your plants

235
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,838
divided by the cost input in terms of

236
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,879
energy

237
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,640
and that gives you um it's not

238
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,799
exactly the correct term to say micro

239
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,360
moles per watt it should really be micro

240
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,799
moles per joule joule of energy but it's

241
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,639
a bit simpler

242
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,759
and easier to understand to say micro

243
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,600
moles per

244
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,559
per um per watt

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
and again it's it's uh i found that

246
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,278
people really like having that simple

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,879
reference point in the same way that if

248
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,039
you're going to buy a car

249
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,039
you'd want to get information on

250
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,480
what the fuel economy is so how many

251
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,759
miles per gallon

252
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,519
and even performance wise you know uh

253
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,000
not to 60s and that sort of thing so

254
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
it's just a simple reference point where

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
you can compare

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
different technologies different types

257
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,000
of grow lights

258
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
and have a benchmark and to compare them

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,320
to

260
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
okay that makes sense

261
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
this next question is very subjective so

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
i'll say in your opinion

263
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,399
what are some things that people should

264
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,278
look for when buying an led grill light

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,039
so

266
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,720
the simplest thing is the size of your

267
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,439
grow area

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,639
so

269
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,800
um you need to provide sufficient

270
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,679
quantity of light to get um good growth

271
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,599
and

272
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,479
that's a function of obviously the

273
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
length

274
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,200
by the width so the the surface area

275
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,439
that you're trying to light

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,519
but also as i said as a function of the

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,120
system so the

278
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,639
using reflective walls and having the

279
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,639
right reflectors are the right hanging

280
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,519
height so generally i recommend starting

281
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,639
off at 500 micro moles per meter square

282
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,879
per second

283
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,319
that's just a power intensity which will

284
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,078
deliver

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,278
good level of performance in terms of

286
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,599
the grow area

287
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,399
but that can rise all the way up to sort

288
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,680
of eight nine hundred micro moles

289
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
average power

290
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,000
and you will literally get uh you know

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,639
if you go from 500 up to 900 you will

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,639
get sort of 40 45 more growth it's

293
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,958
linear so the the return on um your

294
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,039
light intensity is linear up to about a

295
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
thousand micromoles

296
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,278
beyond then we recommend you can use

297
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,759
those higher intensities

298
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,000
but you'll generally get plant stress

299
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:54,078
unless you're supplementing the

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
environment with elevated co2 or are

301
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,958
supplementing with co2 and elevating the

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,360
co2 levels in the grow area

303
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,559
there are lower levels i would recommend

304
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
for seedlings so around 200 to 250.

305
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,119
so once you've established

306
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,639
um you know are do you want to really

307
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,159
uh do you want to just have sort of a

308
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,600
reasonable level of performance out of

309
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,278
the grow area which would be 500

310
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
micromoles or a high performance level

311
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,360
which would be 800 or 900 micromoles

312
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
make that decision again usually i would

313
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
recommend

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,240
learners or beginners would start at 500

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,560
because you've got to really have your

316
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,120
um all your other aspects of your grow

317
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,159
your environment the nutrients the

318
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
medium

319
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,639
everything else um on point to really

320
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
take advantage of those higher um light

321
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,000
levels

322
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,680
so you've established that and then

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,078
you're trying to find a fixture which

324
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,919
will deliver at that level in the grow

325
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,159
area size that you have

326
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,799
most manufacturers now these days um

327
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,480
publish power maps so they'll show the

328
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:57,120
power intensity over the designed and

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,959
grow area and they should give you the

330
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
average micro moles over the grow area

331
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,879
too

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
next step really is about

333
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,159
efficiency and cost

334
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,838
and

335
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,319
like most things in life you know you

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
can get what you pay for you can pay for

337
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,440
an entry light these days

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
so

339
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
and and by the way the entry lights

340
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,958
generally these days are very good um

341
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,958
and they will be about

342
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,559
in in efficiency terms about two

343
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,078
micromoles per watt in terms of

344
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,239
efficiency

345
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,000
and you would pay

346
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,639
somewhere in the region of maybe

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,799
a dollar 20 per watt so you want to get

348
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,360
100 watt light for 2x2 it'll cost you

349
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,599
about 120 130

350
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
and then you can go higher performance

351
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,839
than that

352
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,879
with than you know maybe 2.4 micromoles

353
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,440
per watt some 20 more efficiency 2.5

354
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,838
even but you will pay

355
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
you could pay 50 more per watt so maybe

356
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,880
up to 1.82 dollars a watt for that you

357
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
do get a return over time

358
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,879
and you get other benefits like lower

359
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,879
heat and put into your tent

360
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,799
but you know that's the sort of range

361
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,879
that you'd be operating in

362
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,919
and the last one is spectrum

363
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,600
and i know we're going to talk a lot

364
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,838
about spectrum later but

365
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
in general terms most grow lights that

366
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,200
i've seen

367
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,519
and tested and around the market these

368
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,079
days have a spectrum which is totally

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,519
suitable for growing um all the way from

370
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,958
seed to harvest you don't need to be

371
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
changing grow lights you don't need to

372
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,679
be tweaking or anything like that the um

373
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,800
the spectrums are particularly concerned

374
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,239
about it generally white led lights will

375
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,159
grow um

376
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,399
all plant types

377
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,799
perfectly well all with good development

378
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
good shape good structure all the way

379
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,519
through

380
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
um so yeah your your

381
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,240
size

382
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
work out your area

383
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,879
know your area then find lights that are

384
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,559
designed and suited for that area

385
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,078
then look at the power intensity that

386
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,679
they're designed for

387
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,159
and decide where you want to be on that

388
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,679
range and then really it's you'll find a

389
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,799
range of lights

390
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,519
and usually

391
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,759
there'll be a price range in in in line

392
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,278
with performance for those lights

393
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,039
so one of the things you actually didn't

394
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,559
mention which it could be a little bit

395
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,480
surprising for so many people watching

396
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,078
this is you didn't talk about diodes or

397
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,159
drivers right i think that's one thing

398
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,000
that people look at the first thing oh

399
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,559
does it have samsung diodes does it have

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
an email driver right but you're saying

401
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,159
you know efficiency is kind of more

402
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,759
important in your opinion well

403
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,838
efficiency and

404
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,879
is related to quality

405
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,399
so

406
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,559
the drivers

407
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,120
higher efficiency driver so most

408
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,319
electronics burn out because of heat

409
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,078
and

410
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,079
um if you're running leds very hard so

411
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,319
running them at a very high wattage per

412
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,399
led so driving them hard using a low

413
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
amount of leds to get a high quantity of

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,958
light

415
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,799
and they will run hot but they will also

416
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,119
run less efficiently

417
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,519
and similarly with the transformers or

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,839
the led drivers if they're of low

419
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,039
quality they'll be also generally at low

420
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,639
efficiency

421
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:03,278
and higher quality is is achieved with

422
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,919
um better quality components internally

423
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,600
that are more accurate and and they

424
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,838
often have additional sort of circuitry

425
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
in the drivers to to

426
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,279
elevate

427
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,078
the performance of the drivers so the

428
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,278
driver and the leds combined

429
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,519
will deliver

430
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,439
a high quality driving leds combined

431
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,039
will deliver a high efficiency

432
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,600
and vice versa

433
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,078
and in terms of the leds themselves

434
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,759
there is an obsession with samsung and

435
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,519
they do tend to

436
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
be at the forefront in terms of

437
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,799
efficiency

438
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,360
but the difference between

439
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,039
samsung the most expensive and by the

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
way you'll pay for that

441
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,838
as i'm saying earlier you'll pay for it

442
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
significantly

443
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,639
um and um

444
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,240
your your you know your your samsungs

445
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,720
your soul uh semiconductors which i use

446
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,919
uh your asrams um

447
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
philips bridge looks all of these

448
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,559
manufacturers make great ships

449
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,479
um they're high volume high quality long

450
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,719
established manufacturers

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
and the quality of their components and

452
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
the longevity of their components will

453
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,119
be

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
in line with samsung's just as good

455
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,519
so there is an obsession and i think

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
it's it's borne out of people getting

457
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,078
burnt

458
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,079
excused upon by by by poor

459
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,198
specifications and poor technology in

460
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,519
the past

461
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,639
um but um

462
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,039
like those days are largely gone

463
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,120
and i still hear reports from people on

464
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,519
some of the lights they've tested that

465
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
you know they had some issues with for

466
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,240
example driver burnout and that kind of

467
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
thing

468
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
and but i have to say those the number

469
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,320
of complaints or the the amount of

470
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
feedback i've got on and that in the

471
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
last couple of years has reduced

472
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,639
significantly that makes sense yeah i've

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
seen less reports as well as far as burn

474
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,480
out of leds those are somewhat over i

475
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,439
guess you can see right

476
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,879
yeah

477
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,240
let's flip it up and let's talk about

478
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,639
measuring par i have the apogee mq 500

479
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,519
par meter that measures from 400 to 700

480
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,959
nanometers i also have the mq620 which

481
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,318
is the extended range one it measures

482
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,318
from 340 nanometers to 1040 nanometers

483
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,959
now you've recently found a par meter

484
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,240
that's a bit cheaper than the let's call

485
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,000
it industry standard apogee meters right

486
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,838
and they're just as accurate can you

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,519
talk to us about that

488
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,599
yeah so i was quite surprised myself

489
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,318
because i had looked in the past at

490
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,558
getting an affordable uh quantum sensors

491
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,319
and and getting um alternative ones to

492
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,079
the ones i've been using so i've been

493
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,038
using the apogee myself for about five

494
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,720
years and i would think it's the it's

495
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,038
pretty much the benchmark of people

496
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,120
using it in the industry

497
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,558
and this measures power itself it

498
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,159
doesn't actually read spectrum it

499
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,279
doesn't tell you what the spectrum looks

500
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,038
like that's slightly different to

501
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,359
spectroradiometer

502
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,640
but the the quantum sensor power sensors

503
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,439
are designed

504
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,720
to capture and count

505
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
um photons between 400 nanometers and

506
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,558
700 nanometers

507
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
which is basically from a deep blue up

508
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,759
to the far red

509
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,839
just to that point

510
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,919
and that's the power measurement

511
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,480
and good ones will measure

512
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,799
the the all the photons and all the

513
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,160
wavelengths in that power range

514
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,400
accurately so it'll count um blue

515
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,240
photons as accurately and red photons

516
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
accurately there are other sensors

517
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,079
around there which are sort of

518
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
anything you see that's going to be sub

519
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,159
say

520
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,519
hundred dollars and is likely to be a

521
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,720
modified look sensor light meter

522
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,200
uh which is

523
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
they're designed more for the visible

524
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,600
um

525
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,759
readings or readings of looks and lumens

526
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,918
and not totally suitable for power so

527
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,599
they'll give you slight errors

528
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,520
particularly in the the

529
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:54,079
deep blue and the far red areas

530
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,679
and i did find um

531
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,159
so i got a recommendation actually from

532
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,240
a viewer on one of my videos how i

533
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
checked out this other sensor

534
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,519
um i had a look at it it was

535
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:09,199
significantly cheaper so the apogee sq

536
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:13,119
520 um the power sensor i think with the

537
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,759
con the um display and the reading

538
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,359
meter is about

539
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,679
530 dollars in thereabouts

540
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,399
and this spot on um

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
power sensor was is 300

542
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
so i was a little bit skeptical i

543
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,519
thought it might be sort of a jumped up

544
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,038
looks meter

545
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,839
but i got a whole got in contact with

546
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,440
them

547
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,839
got a hold of when they sent me one over

548
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,880
for test and i started testing

549
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,439
in parallel with the two sensors so

550
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,000
doing my normal tests with the apogee

551
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
and this um spot-on sensor beside each

552
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
other and i found it to be

553
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
you know to a level of

554
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
similarity where you know i'm not sure

555
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,558
which one is more accurate by the way um

556
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,160
but they're both within

557
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,519
in any of the readings or series of

558
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
readings i took within a couple of

559
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,639
percent of each other

560
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,558
so i was really impressed with it i

561
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,559
thought just from a

562
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,759
you know a community and an industry

563
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,599
point of view

564
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,679
um it's a bit of a breakthrough for me

565
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,918
really because a lot of people

566
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,519
basically you know watch my channel

567
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,600
really because they can't afford a

568
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,519
quantum sensor to uh

569
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,439
to to find out the information that i'm

570
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,440
going to tell them so it's ring i think

571
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,038
it's great that the cost of these things

572
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,159
are coming down and it's becoming more

573
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,640
accessible for the average grower to um

574
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
to do the things that i would do so to

575
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
assess

576
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
and optimize their grow lighting setup

577
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,159
yeah i was just about to say that same

578
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
thing it's gla it's about time that

579
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,080
these prices have come down on par

580
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
meters because it is out of so many

581
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,000
people's reach you know 500 that's not a

582
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,480
lot of money for a lot of people you

583
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
know yeah it's expensive so it's good

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,038
that they're now at least one cheaper

585
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
option that's just as accurate as the

586
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,640
apogee meters

587
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
yeah there is another one chris which i

588
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,720
know we're going on to anyway but i did

589
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,279
publish um

590
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,640
some so i did some testing of lux meter

591
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,480
accuracy with different um

592
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
a different spectrum

593
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,679
and you can get pretty close accuracy or

594
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,079
at least consistency in the measurements

595
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,840
using a lux meter and then basically

596
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,199
apply and these lux meters you can get

597
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,119
anywhere from

598
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,798
get from anywhere from fifteen dollars

599
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,798
maybe up to about thirty forty dollars

600
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,200
so much much cheaper

601
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,918
and what i found was that i i did

602
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,558
readings under different spectrum from

603
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,440
about 150 micromoles up to about 1100

604
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,879
micromoles which is is about the full

605
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
range that you need to be able to read

606
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
at

607
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,038
and i found them to be linear so

608
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,960
using them under for say for example i

609
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,519
don't know you could have a mars hydro

610
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,038
sf 2000 or you could have a

611
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,599
viper spectra or you could have a

612
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,038
chilled or whatever light you have

613
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,399
generally these things will read

614
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,599
consistently

615
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,960
now you're reading you're still reading

616
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,959
a looks measurement so it's not power

617
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,519
that would we would want to have

618
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,038
but on on my channel um i've done a few

619
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,480
videos where given conversion

620
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,519
measurements for typical grow light

621
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
spectrum

622
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,200
but the most important thing is that

623
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
it's linear and this means that you can

624
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
map out your grow area you can find out

625
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,480
the relative intensity so are there hot

626
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,240
spots

627
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,798
are there cool spots

628
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,558
and you can also

629
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,359
do your own power maps

630
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,000
and then optimize your own setup so

631
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,479
repeat the testing of your power map in

632
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,640
your own area with your own light setup

633
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,558
at different hanging heights for example

634
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
and find out which one gives you the

635
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,440
best

636
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,759
balance between getting the most light

637
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,759
down onto your grow area and the most

638
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,720
even spread across your grow area at the

639
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,000
same time and you can do that for

640
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,159
twenty dollars

641
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
okay yeah that's great information

642
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
another cheap alternative is you can

643
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,400
actually there are now phone apps you

644
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
can download a phone app and measure par

645
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
just using your phone

646
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,240
but some of these are some of these apps

647
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
are more accurate than others and you

648
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,679
did a whole video on that as well can

649
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,880
you talk to us about your findings there

650
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
yeah so

651
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,400
there's a bit of tech behind it in that

652
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,159
i use the photon app

653
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,919
it's not the new name i think it is

654
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,520
anyway they change name i think it's the

655
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
photon but um

656
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,599
they had um

657
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,400
they have they they're that's

658
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,639
exclusively available on apple store

659
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
for using with apple phones and the

660
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,240
front-facing camera

661
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,079
on apple

662
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,839
they all have the same sensor and the

663
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,798
same processing

664
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,558
uh

665
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
software for that sensor hardware and

666
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,558
software for that sensor

667
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,038
so you can get consistent readings on

668
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,639
any iphone with that app

669
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,919
whereas

670
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
with um

671
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,159
android you know

672
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,759
whether you have a samsung or some other

673
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
version phone

674
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,440
and even within samsung the um the light

675
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,879
sensors are different so it's i didn't

676
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,278
test for every different version of

677
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,600
android phone obviously

678
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,679
so i couldn't um

679
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,319
i couldn't guarantee or say that they

680
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,559
would be accurate for anybody's use

681
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,960
but certainly the photon one i found to

682
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,639
be consistent and useful

683
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,558
and so if you have an iphone definitely

684
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,400
download that and have a go

685
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,278
and then i

686
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,759
um the ppfd app

687
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,240
i'm in contact with the guys that

688
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,640
developed the ppfd app and they actually

689
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,000
have a bluetooth connection

690
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,120
to the to what's called the unity looks

691
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
meter

692
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,839
so you're basically using an external

693
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,000
device with your

694
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,240
smartphone and that has some calibration

695
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
for different grow light spectrum

696
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,839
so you can you can hack

697
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
to

698
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,359
getting at the equivalent of a 300

699
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,359
um

700
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,158
quantum sensor parameter

701
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,079
for i think it's i think the unity

702
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,400
bluetooth version is about again about

703
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,798
twenty dollars twenty-five dollars so

704
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
it's it's perfectly possible

705
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,119
and really any information in this

706
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,360
regard is better than none

707
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,239
so mapping out your area having a look

708
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,918
to see

709
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
where what the light intensity is at

710
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,038
different points

711
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,359
and then adjusting your hanging height

712
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,519
to optimize that will work with really

713
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,119
any of these devices or these systems

714
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,278
that's awesome so now there's just so

715
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,519
many different ways to kind of go about

716
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,359
measuring par that there wasn't five

717
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,960
years ago you know what i mean

718
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,918
so that's awesome that we're actually at

719
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,840
that point yeah absolutely okay so

720
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
people have power measurements another

721
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,240
thing i want to get into is dli now i

722
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,759
don't think i covered this on the

723
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
beginner video i did with austin from

724
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
chill tech dli daily lighting integral

725
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
can you talk to us about that

726
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,440
yeah so um

727
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,320
there's the

728
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,080
intensity at a moment in time which is

729
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,558
your power intensity and that's measured

730
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,519
in micro moles per meter squared per

731
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,678
second

732
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,000
that's the quantity of photons

733
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
impacting on a meter

734
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,278
every second

735
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
and obviously you've got different

736
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,960
lengths of day then

737
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
so what

738
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,558
biologists and horticulturalists are

739
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,759
interested in is

740
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,759
how much

741
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,079
will the plant uptake not just

742
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,480
instantaneously at that moment in time

743
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,678
but over the total day

744
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,240
and so it does vary by species

745
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,600
and so you know if it's a shade loving

746
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
plant for example

747
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,719
it's going to have a much lower

748
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,679
requirement um

749
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,079
for light intensity and it's not going

750
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,080
to want to be exposed to high light

751
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,960
intensity for a long period of time but

752
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,839
then you get um plants which are

753
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,919
will take up a lot of um light intensity

754
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,959
so you know anything from fruiting

755
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
plants

756
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,759
chilies peppers

757
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,879
tomatoes

758
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,919
corn

759
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
and

760
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,720
all the way to medicinal herbs and all

761
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,400
of those will

762
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,919
will utilize high levels of light and

763
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,400
just for reference by the way we were

764
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,720
talking earlier on um about high light

765
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,200
intensity being a thousand micro moles

766
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,400
the sun would be about 2 000 micro moles

767
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,558
midday

768
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,720
so what we're replicating indoors

769
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,440
is is a lower

770
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
uh maximum intensity than sunlight at

771
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,440
midday but of course you know the sun

772
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,558
varies throughout the day

773
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
and

774
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,879
dli is a measurement of capturing that

775
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,719
light intensity over a whole day and

776
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
which you know outside in the sun it

777
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
would start off at maybe about four or

778
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,278
five hundred micromoles in the morning

779
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,440
rise up and peak at about 2000 and drop

780
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,798
down to about 500 in the evening before

781
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,798
sunset

782
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,158
that's if it's a cloudless sky if it's a

783
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,000
clear sky

784
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,880
and um if you sum total that up over 12

785
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,640
hour day that equates roughly to about

786
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,278
40 dli

787
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,399
and dli daily light integral integral

788
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,480
means just

789
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,239
adding all of the results together just

790
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,839
combining everything under that graph

791
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,640
and some accumulating it together

792
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:02,959
and so the recommended maximum dli for

793
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,278
tomatoes for example is 40 40 40 miles

794
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,679
um and

795
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,599
that's just a general guide

796
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,120
you'll have a sort of

797
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,879
semi-shade plants or not as as hungry or

798
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,719
plants that would would be quite happy

799
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
with 20 moles per day

800
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
and as i said you'd have shade ones that

801
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,720
might only want five

802
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,759
but we look at it because you're trying

803
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,640
to understand as i said for the

804
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:31,200
um not just the light intensity but but

805
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,919
also looking at the aspect of over the

806
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,759
the light on time that you have how much

807
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
lights are the light as the plan are the

808
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,359
plants receiving

809
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,918
gotcha so actually i do have a cheat

810
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,278
sheet here furrows surfer dli low light

811
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,159
plants five to 10 medium light plants 10

812
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,240
to 15 and then highlight plants 15 plus

813
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
and there are various sources online

814
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
that kind of measure this you can

815
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,759
actually search dli calculator and

816
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
there's a number of different sources

817
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,759
that you can go in there you basically

818
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,679
just enter in the ppfd canopy and then

819
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,519
the number of hours that the light is on

820
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,919
then you press the calculate button and

821
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,079
then it'll calculate the dli and some

822
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,960
medicinal varieties i've heard of going

823
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,158
50

824
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,679
55

825
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,559
upwards of 65 dli so i thought that was

826
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,440
super interesting it is interesting and

827
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,278
the

828
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,798
interesting development led so it used

829
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,119
to be restricted in terms of indoor

830
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,359
lighting because hid base you would only

831
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,558
get so much light into it into an indoor

832
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,959
area

833
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,798
and before heat would overrun you and

834
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,880
you'd be battling against heat it was

835
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,038
the restrictive uh

836
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,799
measure really to to maximizing the

837
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,558
potential from the space

838
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,240
now that leds are involved in the much

839
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,038
more efficient people are starting to

840
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,440
use much higher light levels so 500

841
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,919
micromoles was high performance five six

842
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,000
years ago with hid as i said it's now

843
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
risen up to a thousand which means you

844
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,519
can

845
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,038
basically double the yield from the same

846
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,440
space and all of the things um you know

847
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,519
being in line so yeah it's it's

848
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,759
impressive that uh improvement is

849
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,359
technology has had a real benefit that's

850
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,960
one of the reasons why you can jump you

851
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,639
know when you're in the vegetation stage

852
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,519
for example i know i think you mentioned

853
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
like 500 ppfd and then you switch that

854
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,240
light cycle

855
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
instead of doing 18 hours a day now

856
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,120
you're down to 12 hours a day so you're

857
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,440
increasing the par number up to you know

858
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,278
900 is a rough number up to a thousand

859
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
as some people say but you do the dli

860
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,398
and it actually makes sense you use that

861
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
dll calculator it makes sense because

862
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,119
you're dropping the number of light

863
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
hours per day but you're increasing the

864
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,278
par so

865
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,399
exactly

866
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,159
let's get into light spectrum next i

867
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:37,678
wanted to start with green light because

868
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,960
a lot of misinformation when it comes to

869
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
green light but

870
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,840
i do want to kind of start from the

871
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
beginning of the electromagnetic

872
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:48,240
spectrum let's start with uv so there's

873
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,679
uva uvb and uvc can you talk to us about

874
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,919
uv light yeah so uv and the lower down

875
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,759
the spectrum we go the higher energy the

876
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,038
light photons are

877
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,440
and so

878
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:04,158
uv uvc would be the lowest um wavelength

879
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,000
of ultraviolet but it's got high energy

880
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,600
photons that's why they're damaging and

881
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,558
can cause cancer

882
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,398
fortunately you don't get uvc through

883
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,079
from the sun because it's it's filtered

884
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,678
out by the atmosphere

885
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:20,079
and similarly

886
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,720
with hid and leds you don't get um

887
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,079
you don't get uvc so we don't have to be

888
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,679
concerned about it and that's good

889
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,879
because it would damage us and damage

890
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,480
the plants

891
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,559
and uvb

892
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,720
is similar in that it's still high

893
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,720
energy photons but

894
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,679
not as damaging they're not

895
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,919
as cancer-causing um and

896
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
basically damaging cells as ubc would be

897
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,360
however they do some damage as we know

898
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,960
because we get sunburned

899
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:50,479
um it is it does there is a response you

900
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,679
can get from plants by using uvb in a

901
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
measured way

902
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,159
so you can stimulate

903
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,240
increases in oil production

904
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,120
and by using uvb

905
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,720
um

906
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,798
gardeners will know this if you've ever

907
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,558
grown rosemary outdoors and grown it

908
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,440
indoors under glass

909
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,639
outdoors you'll get a nice sticky resin

910
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,558
on the leaves

911
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,559
and you can feel it you can smell it

912
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,558
it's much richer in terms of its perfume

913
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,240
and its flavor where it's grown under

914
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,319
glass it'll be

915
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,240
it'll still be green you'll get as much

916
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,798
growth physical growth but it won't have

917
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,960
that stickiness and that resinous and

918
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,879
it's just the same with medicinal herbs

919
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,840
and lots of other plants where you're

920
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,679
looking for um oil production um for

921
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,439
higher quality

922
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,640
there's a few studies out there

923
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,759
and it's again it's it's one of those um

924
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,559
sort of frontier uh parts of of indoor

925
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,720
growing where people are learning and

926
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,879
developing and understanding

927
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,558
but in essence you can increase oil

928
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
production which is the terpenes and the

929
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,319
flavonoids so you can get better smell

930
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
you can't get higher potency with

931
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,158
additional herbs

932
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,240
and but you get a better quality in

933
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,919
terms of um

934
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,798
flavor and smell

935
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,240
um so that's used in short bursts

936
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,158
uh you don't want to use it all the way

937
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
through the grow because

938
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,519
basically it's it's um

939
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,839
it's

940
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
signaling the plant to divert its energy

941
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,639
from

942
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,360
growing in terms of of putting on mass

943
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
to

944
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,639
generating oils

945
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,799
and for that reason we only recommend

946
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,640
using it in the last two or three weeks

947
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,798
of flour um so once the plant has put on

948
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,960
most of its weight and its bulk

949
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,038
and we're trying then we're only using

950
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,600
it a couple of hours a day

951
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,919
uh in the middle of the light cycle

952
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,000
to again to trigger this response in the

953
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,399
plant to generate oil

954
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,558
and that oil is basically too it has

955
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,079
more uses than just you know to smell

956
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,558
the smell and

957
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,839
to taste better those oils also protect

958
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,599
the plant so it's like a natural

959
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,519
response to the plant to protect itself

960
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,439
against these uvb photons which could

961
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,798
potentially damage it

962
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,960
so that's uvb

963
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,558
we don't have uva which

964
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,679
um from a

965
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,639
photosynthetic point of view it's uh

966
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,559
and

967
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,119
from a development point of view it's

968
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,599
very like blue in that it has a an

969
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,200
effect on growth

970
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,919
and however it's not as

971
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,678
photosynthetically efficient so uva

972
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,719
photons

973
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,800
if you had 100 uva photons for example

974
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,918
and 100 blue

975
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,879
photons

976
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:30,078
the uva photons would only view then 20

977
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,878
percent as effective as the blue photons

978
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,280
so

979
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,480
they're not particularly useful

980
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,679
and they are

981
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,559
included in grow light spectrum

982
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,878
um

983
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,799
but they're costly to produce they don't

984
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,239
last very long and as i said they're no

985
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,760
different from a

986
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,678
plant development or growth point of

987
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,599
view than adding blue photons the the

988
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,079
plant responds to saying whether they're

989
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,000
blue or or uva

990
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,320
and that response is to shorten the um

991
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,719
basically smaller cell expansion which

992
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,320
means smaller cells which means shorter

993
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,319
denser plants and shorter denser leaves

994
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,240
but generally i wouldn't

995
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,559
recommend

996
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,919
to spend money or resources on uva in a

997
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,759
grow light system

998
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,838
okay that's really good information and

999
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:24,320
uvc goes from 100 to 280 nanometers uvb

1000
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:26,960
280 to 315 nanometers and then uva 315

1001
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,519
to 400 nanometers so lots of good

1002
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,400
information about uv there next up is a

1003
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,159
400 to 500 nanometers which blue light

1004
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
falls into there and you kind of touched

1005
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,480
on one of the effects of blue light

1006
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,079
which is the shorter internodal spacing

1007
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,240
and inhibits cell division do you talk

1008
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,920
to us about blue light

1009
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,118
yeah so blue light is photosynthetically

1010
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,240
efficient

1011
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,160
so it um it does it grows the plants

1012
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,519
effectively it's about eighty percent

1013
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:57,838
efficient

1014
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,838
um it uh it has it it stimulates again a

1015
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,239
response in the plant so

1016
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,719
if you have less for example less than

1017
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,559
about three or four percent blue you

1018
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,239
will get very stretched out plants and

1019
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,559
this is what growers used to experience

1020
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,078
with high pressure sodium which is

1021
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,440
certainly less usually about three

1022
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,960
percent but certainly less than four

1023
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,519
percent blue

1024
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,720
and so the plant again it um responds

1025
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,079
to the proportion of brule blue light

1026
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,399
and it

1027
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,160
will grow shorter as you said

1028
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,079
international distances so the distance

1029
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,399
between the branches

1030
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,119
but all aspects of the plant will be

1031
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,838
shorter and more compact and dense so

1032
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,800
all of the stalks all of the leaves

1033
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:42,559
will be slightly shorter and more dense

1034
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,960
the more blue light you have in the

1035
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,759
spectrum up to about 25 percent after

1036
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,079
which

1037
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,839
um you um

1038
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,720
there's no difference

1039
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,519
but

1040
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:57,439
uh in in terms of the balance if you

1041
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,639
look at again most white light so even a

1042
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,960
2000

1043
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,159
color temperature so very warm

1044
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,320
um

1045
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,838
white light will have the minimum of

1046
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,640
about five six percent blue

1047
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,480
3000k up to about 5000k the percentage

1048
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,159
blue will range from about 12 up to

1049
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
about 23

1050
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,159
so any of the

1051
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,480
white lights that you get quite led

1052
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,480
lights that manufacturers are producing

1053
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,838
most of them will have sufficient blue

1054
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,599
in the spectrum

1055
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,000
to deliver short dense growth which is

1056
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,000
what we want indoors we want the plants

1057
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,639
to be short and compact

1058
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,480
and because we're height limited and we

1059
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,440
want the plants to

1060
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,079
put on as much bulk as possible without

1061
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
wasting energy basically growing at all

1062
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
and unfortunately

1063
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,960
most grow light listings they're not

1064
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,639
going to tell you what the percent blue

1065
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,838
is unfortunately you only see that from

1066
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,639
an integrated sphere report now if your

1067
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,719
manufacturer is cool and they are

1068
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,559
transparent they will provide you that

1069
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,879
information so you can certainly reach

1070
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,719
out to your manufacturer ask them for

1071
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,960
that report and then it will list the

1072
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,199
different percentages of colors that

1073
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,800
that grow light emits so

1074
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,639
next up is a 500 to 600 nanometers green

1075
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
light falls into that and i don't think

1076
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,118
a lot of people know that green light is

1077
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,480
actually used by the plant or absorbed

1078
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,760
by the plant there's been a lot of

1079
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,760
misinformation that says that green

1080
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,680
light isn't used at all by the plant and

1081
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
you've got those headlamps with the

1082
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,118
green light that's emitted because it's

1083
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,800
not supposed to impact the planet at all

1084
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,640
but that's not actually the case can you

1085
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,960
talk to us about green light

1086
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,480
yeah so i'll debunk first of all

1087
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,199
and so

1088
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,480
in the early days of leds grow lights

1089
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:41,118
people didn't have efficient white leds

1090
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,119
they only had relatively efficient blue

1091
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,079
and red leds so that's all they used in

1092
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,039
grow lights and in order to sell them

1093
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,480
they

1094
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,320
took

1095
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,079
data some sort of

1096
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,400
scientific reports and studies and took

1097
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,160
them out of context and used them as a

1098
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,440
marketing tool to say

1099
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,759
that we we are using blue and red in our

1100
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,240
leds and they're more efficient than in

1101
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,800
other lights for example like hps

1102
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,879
because plants only absorb blue and red

1103
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,039
light and they don't absorb green so all

1104
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,200
the green light out of the hps is wasted

1105
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,639
and because of that

1106
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,000
basically you can you can use a much

1107
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,920
smaller wattage led light than hid

1108
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,719
which was total bs

1109
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,079
and it was based on as i said

1110
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,959
taking

1111
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,640
scientific studies and reports and

1112
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
criteria and using them totally out of

1113
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,319
context

1114
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,480
next piece that sort of confuses people

1115
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,720
is that plants are generally green

1116
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,320
and it stands you know it's common sense

1117
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,239
that something that's green is

1118
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,480
reflecting green light

1119
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,679
and that is true it does reflect some of

1120
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
the green light

1121
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,078
um but it also uh green light tends to

1122
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,720
penetrate deeper into the leaf

1123
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,200
and also will bounce around within the

1124
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,480
um within the canopy so

1125
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,960
it um

1126
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,280
it is is very useful as part of the

1127
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,960
overall grow light recipe to have in

1128
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,440
there because it'll get down into the

1129
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,920
leaf and photosynthesize parts of the

1130
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,280
leaf that other the blue and red for

1131
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,200
example won't um photosynthesize

1132
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,200
and also down into lower parts of the

1133
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:16,159
plant which won't vince photosynthesize

1134
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,639
i wouldn't photosynthesize otherwise

1135
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,799
next part to it is um the green lamp

1136
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,759
that people use for inspecting their

1137
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,280
plants

1138
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,920
green light tends to be the per

1139
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,400
for the amount of photons output is the

1140
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,720
highest response visually so we

1141
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,920
if you took again 100 photons of blue

1142
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,838
100 photons of green 100 photons of red

1143
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,159
we would see much better under those

1144
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,519
hundred photons of green light it gives

1145
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:46,078
us our eyes are much more responsive to

1146
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,639
uh to green light than other spectrum so

1147
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,200
if you are going to use a light

1148
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,039
in an environment it is better to use a

1149
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,199
green light because you can use less of

1150
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,679
it than a white light or a red light or

1151
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,000
a blue light just to see

1152
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,759
so again it's sort of

1153
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,318
uh putting two and two together and

1154
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,400
getting four to say that using a green

1155
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,639
green light doesn't affect the plants it

1156
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,480
will if you use enough of it but you're

1157
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,799
able to use a very small amount of it to

1158
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,800
see and therefore it's the best one to

1159
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,599
use if you have to do it

1160
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,440
and lastly

1161
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,680
the experiments that were done in um so

1162
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,480
mccree mccree curve maybe people have

1163
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,919
seen

1164
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,119
it's experiments that were done in the

1165
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,318
70s which looked at the plant growth

1166
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,519
rate

1167
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,279
under

1168
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,280
discrete

1169
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,960
wavelengths of light so they took maybe

1170
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,400
a five nanometer

1171
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,519
um bandwidth of blue light they shot it

1172
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,680
at a plant

1173
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,119
it's actually algae in the solution and

1174
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,679
they looked at the amount of oxygen it

1175
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,599
produced so how much uh photosynthesis

1176
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,799
was occurring and they looked at that

1177
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,359
discretely

1178
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,560
all the way up through the spectrum

1179
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,480
to

1180
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,440
see how responsive plants were to

1181
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,639
different

1182
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,480
discrete

1183
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,318
wavelengths of light

1184
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,400
that's not what happens in reality in

1185
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,599
reality we don't mush a plan to put it

1186
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,838
into a dish and shine beams of of of

1187
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,280
narrow wavelength beams of light

1188
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,599
the plant is in an environment where

1189
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,760
there's all different wavelengths of

1190
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,039
light all interacting with the plant in

1191
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,599
a different way

1192
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,039
and in in those studies it's shown that

1193
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,359
green light

1194
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,318
is just as effective as blue light

1195
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,000
and but there still is a higher level of

1196
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,358
photosynthetic efficiency with red

1197
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,599
photons

1198
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,598
and so green green is

1199
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,000
the last thing about grain is that if

1200
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,160
you have only blue and red you get a

1201
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,639
purple light and purple light doesn't

1202
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,239
reflect any light off the leaves and the

1203
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,799
leaves look black and you can't see your

1204
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,439
plants properly so having green light in

1205
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,440
with blue and red means you get white

1206
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,440
and white light means you can see your

1207
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,880
plants more clearly

1208
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,119
and

1209
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,240
there's a proverb which is escaping me

1210
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,079
now but

1211
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,279
about gardening and it basically says

1212
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,359
you know if you can't see what you're

1213
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,200
doing you're not going to make mistakes

1214
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,000
and so having a clear white light

1215
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,559
and

1216
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,760
where you can see um

1217
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,920
you know where there might be nutrient

1218
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,119
deficiencies you can see where there

1219
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,200
might be some

1220
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,079
burning okay occurring

1221
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,759
um

1222
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,200
you know disease any of those things

1223
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,800
kind of things you can see much more

1224
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,078
clearly under white light so for all

1225
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
those reasons

1226
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,039
green light is a very useful

1227
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,719
part of the grow lighting recipe

1228
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,318
that's super interesting yeah a lot of

1229
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,159
misinformation about green light i'm

1230
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,838
glad that more and more information more

1231
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,078
and more people are talking about how

1232
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,480
green light is useful to the plant so

1233
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,519
let's talk about red light that's next

1234
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
600 to 700 nanometers i think 660

1235
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,039
nanometers kind of a highlight here a

1236
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,358
lot of people talk about 616 nanometers

1237
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,480
and then we get into far red as well 700

1238
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,799
to 750 nanometers 730 nanometers is

1239
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,960
talked about pretty often you talk to us

1240
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,839
about red light and far red

1241
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,519
yeah so red light is

1242
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,039
useful in two ways

1243
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,079
the

1244
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,358
in the

1245
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,720
is it's at the opposite end of the

1246
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,920
spectrum of uv

1247
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,679
and therefore

1248
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,920
it's higher wavelength

1249
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,519
and lower energy photons

1250
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,440
so electrically they're cheaper to

1251
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,880
produce because they're individually

1252
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
they're lower energy

1253
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,640
so you could per per watt you can

1254
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,960
produce more

1255
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,719
red photons than you can blue or uv

1256
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,599
photons for example so they're

1257
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,480
electrically efficient to produce

1258
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,240
but also the plant is most responsive to

1259
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,719
red photons so

1260
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,199
compared to to blue and green

1261
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,959
um red photons will are more

1262
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,399
photosynthetically efficient by about 10

1263
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,119
or 15

1264
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,400
so having as much red as possible in

1265
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,960
that mix

1266
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,160
will deliver the highest electrical

1267
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,119
and

1268
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,480
and also photosynthetic efficiency

1269
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,358
they don't have

1270
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,760
a

1271
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,440
an effect on the plant development so

1272
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,800
it's like a thinner color it's like a

1273
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,240
you know

1274
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,680
your carbs in your dinner or whatever

1275
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,358
you know it's it's not adding flavor

1276
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,960
anything but it's adding bulk and it's

1277
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,719
adding energy

1278
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,240
it's not going to affect the way the

1279
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,639
plant grows

1280
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,919
and so the common misconception again

1281
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,440
that

1282
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,079
if a light doesn't have you know the

1283
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,119
little red diodes in it that it's not

1284
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,000
suitable for flowering that's not true

1285
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,720
and they don't it doesn't make the plant

1286
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,960
flower or enhance the flowering or

1287
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,279
anything like that and what it does is

1288
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,599
basically it boosts the electrical and

1289
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,119
the photosynthetic efficiency of the

1290
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,280
spectrum overall

1291
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,318
so those little red diodes are generally

1292
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,839
much more expensive than white diodes

1293
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,000
but they're higher

1294
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,639
micro mole per watt efficiency in terms

1295
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,719
of output so we put them in there so

1296
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,719
often described like a turbo booster so

1297
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,959
you got your your main engine which is

1298
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,519
the blue and the green and the bulk of

1299
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,199
the red coming from the the white leds

1300
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,239
and that's providing most of the light

1301
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:58,719
and the spread and then you have these

1302
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,719
red diodes which can boost

1303
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,039
the electrical and photosynthetic

1304
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,358
efficiency of the system overall that's

1305
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,559
really good information for sure last

1306
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,119
but not least

1307
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,239
ir infrared light what do we need to

1308
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,680
know about that

1309
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,559
yeah we're going to start with fire red

1310
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:17,039
actually so infrared is effectively heat

1311
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,119
and it's not photosynthetic so it

1312
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,960
doesn't cause plant growth

1313
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,480
and infrared is what we'd look at with

1314
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,800
that you know an infrared camera where

1315
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,079
we'd see basically radiation coming off

1316
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,839
the surface

1317
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,039
so you can you know get night vision and

1318
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,239
all that sort of stuff you can see in

1319
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,440
the dark

1320
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:36,000
infrared

1321
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,400
is uh is is beyond 750 nanometers

1322
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
far red is just beyond red it's actually

1323
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,559
a very deep red

1324
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,519
far red leds at 7 30 nanometers you can

1325
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,920
see them

1326
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,358
glowing is sort of a very deep red they

1327
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,639
don't look bright but you can see you

1328
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,480
can definitely see that there's light

1329
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,400
coming from them so they're still in the

1330
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,318
visible spectrum as well

1331
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,119
and they're not as photosynthetically

1332
00:46:54,318 --> 00:47:00,239
efficient as red so

1333
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,318
again adding far red diodes

1334
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,239
if you wanted to get more growth you

1335
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,279
would just simply add more white or red

1336
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,479
diodes

1337
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,560
however there is a belief that um adding

1338
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,599
far red will somehow

1339
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,838
boost

1340
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,240
the other um

1341
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,480
spectrum that you have in in the the the

1342
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,318
power spectrum and again there's a bit

1343
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,358
of a misuse around the the emerson

1344
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,838
effect

1345
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,519
um and the emerald and in effect the

1346
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,480
emerson effect is really

1347
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,079
um

1348
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,599
a

1349
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,400
complementary

1350
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,119
uh effect that using different grow

1351
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,599
light spectrum will have on the

1352
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,960
um the overall rate of photosynthesis

1353
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,838
the amount of growth that you'll get

1354
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,119
from that lighting system it doesn't

1355
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:48,000
um there is a very small

1356
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,838
benefit to adding a small bit of far red

1357
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,039
in with red

1358
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,799
it'll complement the red and free up a

1359
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,800
little bit more of the red photons to be

1360
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,280
active so it'll boost the efficiency of

1361
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,039
the red but it's literally it's it's i

1362
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,240
can't remember the exact figure but

1363
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,400
somewhere around

1364
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,039
five percent or something and it's only

1365
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,838
if you use a small amount of fire red

1366
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,159
um

1367
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,159
far red is

1368
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,960
not like red or green it's it's like

1369
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,679
blue in that it has this effect on plant

1370
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,240
development as well as growth

1371
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,919
and it has the opposite effect of blue

1372
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,679
so far red

1373
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,920
too much of it will cause plant

1374
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,838
stretching it'll cause cell expansion

1375
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,440
and plants to stretch

1376
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,679
and that's a bit like blue where you

1377
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,960
want a minimum of five percent to keep

1378
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,639
plants dense

1379
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,199
at far red you don't really want more

1380
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:39,279
than five percent or you'll start to see

1381
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,118
stretching now you can't balance it off

1382
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,680
with blue but then you're into sort of a

1383
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,240
war with the blue and the far red

1384
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,239
and most leds if you look at their grow

1385
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,959
light spectrum charts there'll be a

1386
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,078
little tail or little at the end of the

1387
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,639
curve will go beyond the 700 nanometers

1388
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,240
beyond the red into far red

1389
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,318
most led

1390
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:03,118
white leds will

1391
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,079
emit about two or three percent far red

1392
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,599
anyway

1393
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,280
so you don't again in my view um

1394
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,280
there's a misconception that adding far

1395
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,640
red leds is gonna

1396
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,519
give this extraordinary boost to the to

1397
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,598
the

1398
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,440
uh effectiveness of the rest of the

1399
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,599
photons of the other

1400
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,000
the red the green and the blue photons

1401
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,838
but it's only a very marginal effect and

1402
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,719
one that you would get

1403
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,199
from

1404
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,519
almost every grow light anyway and

1405
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:34,078
adding additional far red

1406
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,358
um leds um

1407
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,400
is

1408
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:41,679
uh in my view counterproductive in that

1409
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,440
you're now in having to add more blue in

1410
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,558
order to balance that off so your plants

1411
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,599
don't stretch

1412
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,400
so if you want more growth more power

1413
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,318
just more power keep it in the narrow

1414
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,599
straight narrow between the 400 and the

1415
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:54,800
700

1416
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,079
and

1417
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,160
in particular

1418
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,359
in the red area because as i said that's

1419
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,279
that's more electrically in

1420
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,119
photosynthetically efficient

1421
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,720
yeah i heard i also heard no more than

1422
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,480
five percent for the far red and

1423
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,358
one other effect particularly on

1424
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,039
medicinal varieties is foxtailing so

1425
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,119
i've had grow lights before that had

1426
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,480
more than that five percent and towards

1427
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,240
the end of flowering it's just there's

1428
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,159
just fox town everywhere so it impacts

1429
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,799
bud development in that avenue as well

1430
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,879
so yeah yeah so it's it's again there's

1431
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,359
a lot of marketing around grow light

1432
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,599
spectrum and

1433
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,358
the way i often describe it is you know

1434
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,760
when you buy a stereo

1435
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,159
for us for us of a certain vintage we'll

1436
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,520
remember in the 90s there was this craze

1437
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,199
with you know all these graphic

1438
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,358
equalizers and lights

1439
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,358
and buttons and sliders and all this

1440
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,960
sort of thing none of which made the

1441
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,799
sound any better

1442
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,800
and in fact if anything they were taking

1443
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,280
money away from putting in good quality

1444
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,200
components into having flashing lights

1445
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,400
and dials and indicators that didn't add

1446
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,000
to the sound

1447
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,680
and it's a bit like that with grow

1448
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,079
lights as far as i'm concerned people

1449
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,960
see the blues and you sorry the uvs and

1450
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,760
the far reds and these extra diodes and

1451
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,358
think they add something all i see is

1452
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,839
waste i see

1453
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,838
money being put into stuff which is just

1454
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,239
marketing trinkets

1455
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,799
and if you want more growth get more

1456
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,000
power which is just

1457
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
you know per watt getting higher

1458
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,400
efficiency grow lights or having more

1459
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,400
wattage simple as that

1460
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,559
um most modern

1461
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,559
there i haven't seen the ground light i

1462
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,559
haven't tested the grow light

1463
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,760
and i've tested maybe 100 grow lights in

1464
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,760
the last

1465
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,839
two years two or three years i haven't

1466
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,480
seen one

1467
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,519
whose uh

1468
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,318
spectrum wasn't suitable for growing

1469
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,119
so

1470
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:45,440
there's a lot of search for sort of

1471
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,838
little gains here and there with that

1472
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,960
with spectrum or sort of magic secret

1473
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,039
sauce and generally there isn't any and

1474
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,440
as i said use a white light and use

1475
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,318
enough of it distribute the light evenly

1476
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,639
and

1477
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,880
you'll get you'll you'll optimize your

1478
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,879
your potential yield i remember going to

1479
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,960
mj biz con a couple years ago for those

1480
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,400
that don't know it's an expo and every

1481
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,079
company is there basically every

1482
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,838
company's there they show off their

1483
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,599
newest products and this lighting

1484
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,880
company stopped by their booth and i

1485
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,960
forget the name of the grow light but

1486
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,200
they had it so you could adjust the

1487
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,639
spectrum and it was like super

1488
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,799
customizable and i think it was like a

1489
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,239
four thousand dollar grow light i walked

1490
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,720
by there and just raised my eyebrow i'm

1491
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:27,279
like really like four thousand dollars

1492
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,279
to it just it made no sense and like you

1493
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,160
said it's marketing is involved in that

1494
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,400
as well

1495
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:36,399
what i would say is if you're

1496
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,240
if you're growing a very specific um

1497
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,079
it could be a bedding plant

1498
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:43,199
or it could be a herb

1499
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,359
and you're a mass producer and you're

1500
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,239
you know you're generating thousands you

1501
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,159
know you've acres of of space

1502
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,199
what you might do

1503
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,039
is you might refine a spectrum

1504
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,199
to for example

1505
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,079
so tweaks in the red and tweaks in the

1506
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,519
far red can affect for example the time

1507
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,680
that

1508
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:06,159
you know your petunias flower at

1509
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,358
and you can trigger particular responses

1510
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,358
in plants

1511
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,519
and in order to make them flower in

1512
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,199
order to make them more leafy so what i

1513
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,639
said about far red

1514
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,000
but again there's a misconception out

1515
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,159
there because there's some videos out

1516
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,679
there people showing that far red can

1517
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:21,039
produce a higher yield but it's of

1518
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,358
lettuce

1519
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,358
and lettuce you're looking just to get

1520
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,960
leaf you just want lots and lots of leaf

1521
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,960
and you wanted to produce as much leaf

1522
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,480
as possible so far red in that instance

1523
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,599
is basically making them stretch a

1524
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,358
little bit

1525
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,119
and generating more leaf which is what

1526
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,358
you want

1527
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,400
also you could be using

1528
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,759
a little bit higher blue will bring out

1529
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,240
oh i gotta pronounce it properly

1530
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,359
anthrocynons anyway did the sort of

1531
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,039
purple

1532
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,119
pigments in plants

1533
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:52,079
so if you're producing a red lettuce for

1534
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,720
example or a purple lettuce indoors

1535
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,800
under green under um artificial lighting

1536
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,679
you might want to

1537
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,519
tweak

1538
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,679
the light spectrum to bring out certain

1539
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,920
characteristics of that plant

1540
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,199
and but in general if you're a home

1541
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,280
grower

1542
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,759
in particular

1543
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,200
it's a bit like um

1544
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,040
you know

1545
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,879
your setting will never be perfect for

1546
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,480
the different stages of growth what you

1547
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,760
want is something that hits the middle

1548
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,599
for the whole

1549
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,680
uh grow

1550
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,640
um and in that sense

1551
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,558
having

1552
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,159
as i said anywhere between five and

1553
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,160
fifteen percent blue

1554
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,118
about thirty percent grain about forty

1555
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,159
percent red is your optimum spectrum

1556
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,358
and

1557
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,440
the benefits of moving away from that so

1558
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,960
putting money into having dials to

1559
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,159
adjust spectrum and different drivers

1560
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,119
and different channels and all that sort

1561
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,199
of stuff

1562
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,798
in my view you'd be far more better off

1563
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,399
just having more light and a more

1564
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,838
efficient light

1565
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,920
and you're going to get more you're

1566
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:52,159
certain to get more yield that way

1567
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,519
rather than being uncertainly twiddling

1568
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,118
around with things

1569
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,159
trying to get an effect which will be

1570
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,240
different based on different strains and

1571
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,318
varieties of plants

1572
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,838
so you know whether it's indica dominant

1573
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,960
or sativa dominant for example with

1574
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,400
medicinal herbs you could have

1575
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,720
a different response from different

1576
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,280
plants under the under different

1577
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,639
lighting conditions so just stay in the

1578
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,240
middle

1579
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,838
don't make something more complicated

1580
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,519
than it should be

1581
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:20,960
just get as much light down there as

1582
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,838
your plants can

1583
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,798
can

1584
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,558
absorb get it down evenly

1585
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,759
and you know if you want to tweak and

1586
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:31,280
twiddle start looking at medium or

1587
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,240
you know nutrients or something else

1588
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,440
because

1589
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,199
if you've optimized your lighting

1590
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,519
spectrum with with a modern grow light

1591
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,199
which is white there really is is is not

1592
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,280
much other places to go

1593
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:43,519
well said so like you mentioned just a

1594
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,720
few minutes ago you've tested over 100

1595
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,239
grow lights

1596
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,439
we got to know what are some of the best

1597
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,439
grow lights on the market today that

1598
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,760
you've tested well i put it into

1599
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,280
different categories really because

1600
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,200
there are some lights which are just

1601
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,359
really really good value and

1602
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,639
extraordinary quality for how cheap they

1603
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,798
are

1604
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,960
and there are others which are

1605
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,920
multiple of times as expensive per what

1606
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,599
to buy

1607
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,200
but are extraordinary because they have

1608
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,559
really good efficiency and really high

1609
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,558
quality in terms of their build

1610
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,039
i would say in the budget category

1611
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,280
i reviewed some that have been

1612
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,719
exceptionally good from a build quantity

1613
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,240
a quilt build

1614
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,358
quality point of view

1615
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:25,439
so your your ton of amazony type lights

1616
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:27,199
around a dollar a what

1617
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,960
generally they tend to be a little bit

1618
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:33,598
tinny and flimsy in at parts but uh one

1619
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,519
that stood out for me was maxi sun

1620
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,960
really high quality build

1621
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,280
it's that sort of build quality where

1622
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,119
you just when you have it in your hand

1623
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,480
it's nothing in particular it's all the

1624
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,880
little details it's everything is

1625
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,798
finished off really well so they have

1626
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,200
that sort of um baking tin type

1627
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,960
reflector that mars hydro used and a few

1628
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,639
other manufacturers use but it's a

1629
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,559
little bit more solid and it's a little

1630
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,118
bit more robust

1631
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,760
than maybe the mars hydro one

1632
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,599
and speaking of mars hydro there

1633
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,440
what's the name of it again the

1634
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,960
long-form one

1635
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,079
sp 3000

1636
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,000
sp

1637
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,680
the sp series it's been added by two

1638
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,599
years they've revised that this year

1639
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:14,558
it's really good quality

1640
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,480
and so again in the lower price category

1641
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,798
that's that's a good one

1642
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,760
in the medium price range

1643
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:24,400
i'm going to plug my own so microarray

1644
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,280
and i try to strike that balance between

1645
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,200
being

1646
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,519
good quality as well as good performance

1647
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,879
and decent price so it's you know that

1648
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,679
that

1649
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,680
a a good balance of all those

1650
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,719
um you get up into the higher

1651
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:41,279
performance range a higher price range

1652
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,318
more commercial type fixtures

1653
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,960
um

1654
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:47,679
in terms of the um

1655
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,720
you know the uh the cost in particular

1656
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:54,078
and i would say lumatec

1657
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:57,199
uh also known as photon tech in the us

1658
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,240
are an excellent brand i've i've i used

1659
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,960
to use them

1660
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,199
i've been using them for 15 years you

1661
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,720
know my first digital ballast i bought

1662
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,078
was lumatec

1663
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,239
and i've never heard anything other than

1664
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,760
good things about them their build

1665
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,358
quality is excellent the performance is

1666
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,599
excellent bit of a premium for it but

1667
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:15,199
it's worthwhile

1668
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,798
uh

1669
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,519
gavita

1670
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,039
love their led light but again it's you

1671
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,000
know

1672
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,440
you probably would be in the commercial

1673
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,639
space if you're going to be paying that

1674
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,599
much for them because they're quite

1675
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,199
expensive in terms of cost per dollar

1676
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,200
um

1677
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,639
but yeah i've reviewed

1678
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,919
hundreds of them

1679
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:40,400
uh i don't review all the grow lights i

1680
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,599
get offered or asked to review

1681
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,440
so

1682
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,039
anyone that i do has sort of passed the

1683
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,039
basic test but i've taken it out of the

1684
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,719
box it hasn't fallen apart in my hands

1685
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:50,558
the build quality is good the

1686
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:51,439
performance is decent

1687
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,280
the

1688
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,119
in particular kind of particular about

1689
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,359
the information they provide as well so

1690
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,680
check to see are they making reasonable

1691
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:04,598
are their specifications reasonable

1692
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:04,598
um and like i would reject

1693
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,960
i'd probably reject like two to one so

1694
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,558
i'd probably reject two grow lights for

1695
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,559
every one i test

1696
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,839
and on the basis that there's an awful

1697
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,798
lot of

1698
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:19,119
um spurious sort of

1699
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,199
you know uh

1700
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,760
yeah just missing on a few of the main

1701
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,439
points in terms of build quality and in

1702
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,440
particular the marketing information or

1703
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,720
the specifications

1704
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,960
um

1705
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,639
you know i had one the other day and i

1706
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,199
looked okay on the website i got it

1707
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,358
delivered it was a chinese manufacturer

1708
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,919
which by the way is not a

1709
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,440
derogatory term i use i use it sometimes

1710
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,358
and people think that i'm using that as

1711
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,318
a derogatory term it's not

1712
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:45,519
um

1713
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,318
you know

1714
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,719
my drivers are made in hong kong my my

1715
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,719
led boards are assembled in china and

1716
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,318
shipped here you know pretty much every

1717
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,879
grow light is made in china these days

1718
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,920
so it's not a i'm not separating out

1719
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,079
chinese as a drugs return but anyway

1720
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,000
they were marketed and sold directly by

1721
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,160
themselves they sent me the light i took

1722
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,880
it out of the box and immediately

1723
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:12,239
um the central beam which had the

1724
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,519
drivers in it was just rattling around

1725
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:15,838
and

1726
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,079
so i opened up the cover and

1727
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,679
it was you could just the build quality

1728
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,760
that the

1729
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:22,719
extrusions were really thin and really

1730
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,079
tinny

1731
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,318
and um

1732
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,760
the drivers weren't fixed down properly

1733
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,400
and when i opened it up it was just like

1734
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,200
a rat's nest of wiring and

1735
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,880
you know

1736
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,558
anyway i i called them up luigi and just

1737
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,079
said look i'm going to throw it on the

1738
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,599
bin or you can collect this i'm not

1739
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,680
testing this so

1740
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,519
um there is still

1741
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,358
quite a lot of junk out there so i would

1742
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:44,719
recommend if you're going to buy a grow

1743
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:46,639
light do have a look at the channel

1744
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,598
because it's a it's at least a minimum

1745
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,318
level

1746
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,760
of guarantee that the build quality is

1747
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,519
up to a comparable standard or a good

1748
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,359
standard for the industry

1749
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:00,000
and then as i said

1750
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,838
you'll see from the performance

1751
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,079
whether the components are of a good

1752
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,679
quality or not high performance means

1753
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,039
they've had to use

1754
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:08,239
good quality

1755
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,558
components

1756
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,358
medium you know it's probably price

1757
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,599
related they're probably um trading off

1758
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,000
with with cost and price

1759
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,640
and uh low efficiency

1760
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,159
you know i may not be you know i'm not

1761
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,239
saying it directly to camera but you can

1762
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,519
usually tell if you watch me closely

1763
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,879
that i'm sort of

1764
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,880
yeah this could be better you know

1765
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,079
i'll be subtly hinting that there's

1766
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,598
better things on the market than this

1767
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,280
one even though it might be adequate in

1768
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,039
other ways you know yeah you're very

1769
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,480
transparent when it comes and very

1770
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,558
honest when it comes to your girl light

1771
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,559
reviews and you don't review any bad

1772
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,280
grow lights but just for clarification

1773
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:47,040
you used to years ago and used to be

1774
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,160
very brutally honest and it was actually

1775
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,639
kind of funny i'm looking at one of your

1776
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:53,838
titles right now totally pointless grow

1777
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,838
light i love it

1778
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,599
but there were some sort of novelty uh

1779
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,720
grow lights that um because people would

1780
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,400
would send me emails saying you know

1781
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,439
so for example i bought some of these i

1782
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,519
know if you've seen them when i was

1783
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,280
under the the home garden lights and

1784
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,358
they have a they have a stand and they

1785
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,039
have these flexible arms with these

1786
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,880
little led bars on the top yeah they're

1787
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,520
still purple and you're supposed to

1788
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,039
position them over your house plants so

1789
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:20,639
you know people have offered me them and

1790
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,160
i've actually gathered together about

1791
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:23,838
five or six of them

1792
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,838
to do like you know when i have a couple

1793
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:28,558
of days where i just want to have a bit

1794
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:30,798
of fun to reduce i'm going to test those

1795
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,720
and see what they do because i'm pretty

1796
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,838
sure they're going to be atrocious but

1797
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,919
um

1798
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:40,159
yeah i i

1799
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,639
i don't want i i like to keep things

1800
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,399
not non-contentious but

1801
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,400
i basically don't want to be rubbishing

1802
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,039
anybody else's products i don't want to

1803
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,039
be having a negative effect on another

1804
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,079
company unnecessarily

1805
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:57,440
um so um i just don't like that five i

1806
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,039
don't like you know the sort of

1807
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,960
comments that come with it and all that

1808
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,559
stuff so i'll be gracious i hope um when

1809
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,400
a really good light that's much better

1810
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,680
than mine is there

1811
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,400
um and uh you know i'll just be quiet

1812
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,639
and hold my peace when um when there's

1813
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,358
some junk or you know i'll give a subtle

1814
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,759
indication that i'm you know not very

1815
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:22,719
impressed with the particular fixture

1816
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,079
lady technology has come so far in such

1817
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,000
a short period of time i mean you

1818
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,280
mentioned mars hydro having a good light

1819
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,519
you say that you know back in 2015 2016

1820
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,359
people will laugh at you they had hot

1821
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,440
garbage lights back then but they've

1822
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,798
really turned their things around and

1823
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,079
their lights have gotten a lot better

1824
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:39,920
and they're up there with the best

1825
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,000
nowadays

1826
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,039
now my question is with lighting

1827
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,798
technology moving so rapidly

1828
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,559
what do you see what innovations do you

1829
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:50,719
see happening with lighting technology

1830
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,160
in the upcoming five years

1831
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,558
getting cheaper

1832
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,838
is the big thing so

1833
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,440
and it's the same with the you know

1834
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,199
domestic lighting

1835
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,880
all forms of lighting

1836
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,679
the um

1837
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,760
so

1838
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,679
in terms of failure and problems with

1839
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,079
led lights

1840
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,318
um biggest issue up to the last few

1841
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,480
years was actually the power supplies

1842
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,318
for the led drivers they were the thing

1843
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,358
most likely to fail out of a lighting

1844
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:18,798
system and most of that was just cheap

1845
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:20,558
cheaply made

1846
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,000
low efficiency

1847
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,079
drivers

1848
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,039
and they would generate a lot of heat

1849
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,280
and

1850
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,039
there's uh components called capacitors

1851
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,720
in them and they're a little bit like a

1852
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,839
battery but they've got a gel in them

1853
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:36,078
and they literally dry out and pop when

1854
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,838
uh when heating too much and that's you

1855
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,599
know you get the flickering of an led

1856
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:42,000
light like a home light or whatever

1857
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,400
starts to flicker that's or you see it

1858
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,960
in in vehicle lights as well that's

1859
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,440
often because the driver has blown um

1860
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,559
not necessarily the leds or starting to

1861
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,599
go

1862
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,880
and

1863
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,599
with the leds themselves the technology

1864
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,519
so

1865
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,280
if you look beneath that

1866
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,519
phosphorus the yellow coating on top of

1867
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,880
the leds down into what's underneath

1868
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:07,519
and the basic technology has not changed

1869
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,440
in the last 10 years

1870
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,318
in terms of white leds so they're

1871
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,880
basically a blue led underneath that

1872
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:17,358
white phosphorous coating and that white

1873
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,760
phosphorus diffracts or breaks up that

1874
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,358
blue light into other colors so into

1875
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,720
green or red and the more phosphorus we

1876
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:23,759
use the more

1877
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:25,679
um

1878
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,839
warm the color will go so the more red

1879
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:29,679
it'll produce and vice versa

1880
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,078
and but that technology hasn't changed

1881
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,639
very much what has happened is is we've

1882
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,280
got it's got cheaper so people are using

1883
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,879
more leds compared to before

1884
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,960
and because they're using more of them

1885
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,720
they're per watt because they're using

1886
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,679
more of them they're running them at

1887
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,439
lower currents lower wattage

1888
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,838
and because of that

1889
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,519
at lower wattage they run more

1890
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:53,519
efficiently but they also run cooler and

1891
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:55,440
they're less likely to

1892
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:57,599
to to burn out

1893
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,240
and within the leds there's tiny little

1894
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,000
gold wires attached onto the wafers

1895
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,759
and if they overheat those gold wires

1896
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,079
melt or detach from the wafers and

1897
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,400
that's when leds blow basically

1898
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,359
or burn out um

1899
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,079
so

1900
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:14,558
it's between the driver technology

1901
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,000
getting better up to about 95 is pretty

1902
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,480
standard now they're not that's not

1903
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,119
going to improve very much the basic led

1904
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,639
technology has there isn't a new

1905
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,480
technology out

1906
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,440
in the last 10 years so they're all just

1907
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,519
refining and tweaking and twiddling and

1908
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,000
improving the overall system efficiency

1909
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:33,838
by using more leds with better tolerance

1910
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,119
or more accuracy in terms of the

1911
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:36,639
circuitry

1912
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,920
and that's delivering slightly higher

1913
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,639
efficiencies

1914
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,159
and but what is being obtained today

1915
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:43,759
could have been obtained seven or eight

1916
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,199
years ago with a very high amount of

1917
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,200
cost

1918
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,439
or at least close to

1919
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,000
and the biggest difference now is cost

1920
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,679
so um where

1921
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,960
uh you know it wouldn't have been

1922
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,399
uncommon for a 100 watt so say a little

1923
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,760
light for two by two would have been

1924
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,280
three hundred dollars for a high

1925
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,119
efficiency one

1926
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,039
uh and i'm saying high efficiency sort

1927
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,880
of two to two point two micromoles per

1928
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,400
watt these uh

1929
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,720
four or five years ago

1930
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,200
you could now get for a hundred dollars

1931
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,000
so it was dropped by a third

1932
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:19,199
and i've seen a big reduction just in

1933
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,960
the last 12 months

1934
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,239
and it's typical of a maturing industry

1935
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,119
really

1936
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,798
that when people stop you know sort of

1937
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,119
innovating and getting new developments

1938
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,960
in technology they then all fight each

1939
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,838
other for with the same technology for

1940
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,440
the same market share and that goes all

1941
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,440
the way up and down the supply chain and

1942
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,679
everybody tightens their belts and

1943
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,400
usually you'll end up with

1944
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,239
a smaller number of large manufacturers

1945
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,720
who are very efficient

1946
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,000
um very

1947
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,679
cut their cost

1948
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,119
controlled very well

1949
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,078
and delivering high volumes and

1950
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,079
therefore

1951
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,599
able to deliver low prices

1952
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,440
we've seen a lot of new entry big

1953
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,599
entrance into the market in the last

1954
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,440
year or so coming in very aggressively

1955
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,798
with low pricing so

1956
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,440
i think that's what's going to change i

1957
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:08,239
think the next thing is

1958
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:11,519
as i was saying before about pushing

1959
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:13,519
the limit of where of light levels and

1960
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,759
light intensity and yields per square

1961
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,158
meter per square foot

1962
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,520
and i think um

1963
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:21,679
one of the developments which might

1964
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,040
assist that is cheaper and more

1965
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,158
accessible

1966
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,759
um environment control in terms of co2

1967
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,479
supplementation and that type of thing

1968
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,039
so

1969
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:35,358
you've already got these sensors you get

1970
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:36,158
a co2 sensor now for 40 or 50 dollars

1971
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,480
where

1972
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,318
you know i bought one

1973
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,678
four years ago and i

1974
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,319
bought the cheapest one i could find and

1975
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,279
it's 350. you know so

1976
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,520
um

1977
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,640
sensing technology getting better

1978
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,159
like we were talking about earlier

1979
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,679
having better control over your lighting

1980
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,079
system so getting

1981
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,480
getting equipment and technology that

1982
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,079
will help you set up better and optimize

1983
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,759
your setup better

1984
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:00,880
um

1985
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,238
yeah that's where i think things are

1986
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,600
going over the next certainly the next

1987
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,000
two or three years

1988
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,480
awesome well definitely that's exciting

1989
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,838
for consumers to have cheaper prices you

1990
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,639
know

1991
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,719
more more and more affordable for people

1992
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,480
definitely yeah so wrapping things up

1993
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,239
how can listeners find you and what do

1994
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,399
you have upcoming in the future

1995
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,000
yeah so uh the youtube channel is micro

sort of being a

that i did three years ago and i cringe

i really got

2031
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,119
to get them up up to at least my my

2032
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,239
current standard because uh yeah they

2033
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,920
were um

2034
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,678
they're hard even for me to get through

2035
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,399
because i was uh

2036
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,440
you know i wasn't as as capable as i am
