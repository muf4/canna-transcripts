always giving back and and this was I my

88
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,060
opportunity I saw to to give back to the

89
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,239
community to share my knowledge I've

90
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,039
been gardening since I was a little kid

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,439
I've always you know had the privilege

92
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,658
in the summertime going out and picking

93
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,439
up fresh tomato and washing it off and

94
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:21,120
eating it right from the vine

95
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,098
later in my teens my parents kind of let

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,980
me experiment and start my own little

97
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,318
garden plots in the backyard and and

98
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,598
from there you know at a young age I

99
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,458
knew I was pretty connected and I was

100
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,340
going to probably be doing some forms of

101
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,340
gardening throughout my life

102
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,519
and as I got older it held true through

103
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,120
different variations of rental homes and

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,340
buying homes and anything in between

105
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,400
adapting so that I can continue my

106
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,340
skills and continue my knowledge so one

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,519
day when I had a family that I could

108
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,519
pass it down to them and I do I'm a

109
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,280
single father of three kids

110
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,799
and we recently this will be I think our

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,799
fourth year since we broke ground and

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,860
our new house and our new garden and and

113
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,080
from here you know it's it's teaching

114
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,680
them the basics trying not to over

115
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,319
complicate it and and and mainly

116
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,120
connecting and you'll see this through

117
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,699
this presentation I'm going to keep it

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,860
very basic we're not going to go into

119
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,500
super technical but I'm going to outline

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,139
things for you guys to plant the seeds

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,259
of questions to ask yourself as every

122
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,600
process as you start your garden and

123
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,720
um and we'll we'll get it started now

124
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,580
awesome talking about my first time ever

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,919
gardening from what I can remember it

126
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,599
was with my grandparents and I was super

127
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,680
young I may be around five years old or

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
something I don't remember the exact

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,959
exact age but I was pretty big in their

130
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,139
life but it wasn't big in my parents

131
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,500
life so like it didn't really pass on to

132
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,319
me as a kid as you know I wish it did

133
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,360
you know looking back I wish it did so

134
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,819
um like I mentioned once I have a family

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
in the future being able to pass on to

136
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,959
my kids so yeah let's get into this

137
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,819
presentation I'm excited you know and I

138
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,279
and I the main thing I tell my kids too

139
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,680
is no matter what you choose to do in

140
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,239
your life you don't have to Garden you

141
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
don't have to feel the pressure to do so

142
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,500
but just note that you have the skills

143
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,180
and the power to provide for yourself or

144
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,160
your family in the future if you need to

145
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,139
and they might not understand that yet

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,180
but it's pretty powerful because we all

147
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,418
know the economy and things shift and

148
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,538
move around and having this ability is

149
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:40,379
it's just it's so rewarding not just for

150
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,939
as a parent but just as the children too

151
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,100
um so we'll get started

152
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,680
um uh starting a family garden should be

153
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,360
fun try not to get overwhelmed with all

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,160
the different methods and practices that

155
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,960
are out there these things will come

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,120
with time and I'm speaking from

157
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,399
experience like if you're if you choose

158
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,160
Organics like don't feel that you have

159
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,038
to do composting and this type of

160
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,139
composting and ferments um stick with

161
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,659
the basics don't feel the pressure of

162
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,939
needing it and especially nowadays with

163
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,340
platforms and the availability of

164
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,259

00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,799
overwhelming and we just get way too

168
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,740
much and we feel that pressure that we

169
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,478
need to do it you don't scale your

170
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,478
garden to fit your family's schedules

171
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:31,318
and demands remember summer's coming

172
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:34,139
soccer practices cheer practices summer

173
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,759
picnics like what are your demands as a

174
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,620
family and these are things that are

175
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,439
always going to shift as yourself and

176
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,060
your children get older and it'll help

177
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,459
you not bite off too much than you can

178
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,740
take remember you're going to have

179
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,839
awesome ears and not so many great years

180
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,699
some problems may be from your own doing

181
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,099
why others are completely out of your

182
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,560
control no matter what the circumstances

183
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,900
may be you are still connecting and

184
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,459
learning that's really important the

185
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,459
only loss in the garden is the

186
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,019
opportunity not taken so if I plan to

187
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,239
vacation and

188
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,918
I came back and all the by ripened

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
Tomatoes were bad it's not a lost cause

190
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,599
I can compost it I can I can do other

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,819
things there's so many

192
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,500
um Avenues in gardening that you can

193
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,360
take

194
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,978
um and a garden should breathe and grow

195
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,340
with your family and that kind of goes

196
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:25,318
back to how you scale that and it it

197
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,418
some years you might expand and get it

198
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,580
bigger and other years it might have to

199
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,279
get smaller contracted or maybe some

200
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,800
maybe you move and you go from a house

201
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,239
to a condo an apartment you might have

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
to go to pots and something that's

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,400
smaller to suit your needs

204
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,139
and then and for and for those who are

205
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,698
watching on pitcher that's our our

206
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,220
second year of our family garden where

207
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,280
we broke ground we were super proud of

208
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,900
it and I put a picture on there

209
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,519
yeah that's pretty cool let's talk about

210
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,138
that for a second break it down for us

211
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,879
just a little bit about like how many

212
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,500
beds you have and like what are some of

213
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,659
these plants that they're seeing on the

214
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,879
screen right now yeah so this is two

215
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,520
years ago so a lot has changed uh it

216
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,519
does our garden does breathe quite a bit

217
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,159
um in terms of beds this one had two

218
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,538
raised beds one was for carrots and one

219
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,759
was like this makeshift one that I have

220
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,860
for potatoes and you can kind of see it

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,319
in the back there's a long run of wood

222
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,360
and that's all potatoes in there

223
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,720
um this year my kids kind of carved out

224
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,460
paths you can see uh malt paths and we

225
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
just kind of Incorporated plants and

226
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,079
plopped them in I did have guidance of

227
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,819
where I wanted onions and stuff but I

228
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,218
kind of left it up to them to explore

229
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,099
and and to figure it out

230
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:42,959
um it's roughly right now I think it's

231
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:46,020
it's about 25 by 15 and then we did

232
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,259
another new plot last year and that's

233
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,919
probably about a 10 by 10 behind my shed

234
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,319
um

235
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,139
so it's a decent sized Garden but don't

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,480
let the size discourage you because if

237
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,220
you can only have a 4x4 area whether

238
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,740
it's in the ground directly sewed or in

239
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,959
a raised bed like be happy with that and

240
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,639
plant what you can with that like If

241
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,739
eventually you can have a big Garden so

242
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,179
be it but it doesn't make me more

243
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,879
successful than the person with a

244
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,919
smaller Garden by no means in saying

245
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,320
that we're going to go into the to the

246
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,379
second slide and and I outlined them as

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,620
Garden elements and basically you need

248
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,899
seeds plants weather and food very basic

249
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,759
and and depending on your type of

250
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,860
growing you can even maybe take food out

251
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,679
because you might be more towards

252
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,320
favoring microbial or letting

253
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,359
um the nature kind of extract and mine

254
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,519
what it needs but for seeds make sure

255
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,519
your sourcing quality seeds that are

256
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,899
suited for your region choose heirlooms

257
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,480
if you're wanting to collect seeds for

258
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,240
the following year so if you have a plan

259
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,700
on planting seeds don't buy like

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,019
seedless watermelons or these hybrids

261
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,300
that are really steering towards

262
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,959
genetics that are not going to give you

263
00:09:54,299 --> 00:10:00,659
a seed to to reproduce with so keep that

264
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,059
in mind when you're purchasing seeds I'm

265
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:06,059
not going to say only plant organic

266
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,039
seeds or this seeds your region your

267
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,018
resources are different than mine so you

268
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,799
have to kind of decipher what's best for

269
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,440
you

270
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,539
plants what plants can you grow in your

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,399
soil what will provide you the most for

272
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,019
your time I'm not saying most for your

273
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,639
money I'm saying most for your time

274
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,860
because that's time with your children

275
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,360
that's time at sports events that's

276
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,600
times just around the dinner family

277
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,399
around the dinner table

278
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,720
weather know your growing zone and we're

279
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,539
going to go into this in the in the

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,399
future slide but the growing zone is is

281
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,278
really important and what challenges may

282
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,039
arise so my I live in Northern Illinois

283
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:44,399
my problems would be at times extremely

284
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:47,099
high humidity other times really dry and

285
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,679
hot and then two days later back to

286
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,180
extreme humidity so if we're kind of

287
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:57,120
thinking VPD outside my vvd ranges are

288
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,278
all over the place and I have to take

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,000
that into consideration of what crops

290
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:05,220
will grow good for my time in my region

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,379
and then the last one is food what

292
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,180
sources of fertilizer will you need what

293
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,399
techniques interest you slash line up

294
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,559
with your values and and this kind of

295
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,240
goes into taking on techniques and all

296
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,179
the other stuff what is to your values

297
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,560
you know not everybody like wants to do

298
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,039
compost

299
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,979
um I I for myself I like doing ferments

300
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,599
but I probably will never try a jadam

301
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,399
wedding agent or something like that

302
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,740
personally just doesn't

303
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,480
do anything for me but I know that I can

304
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,700
source that from other people in the

305
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,399
community over like Green Goblin and

306
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,440
he's very competent and has mastered the

307
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,458
safety and the skills to do so where I'm

308
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,399
like I don't want to do it so

309
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,319
um taking that into consideration

310
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,139
um when picking you know your techniques

311
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,300
or your food you know this will all kind

312
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,338
of line in with plugging in how you're

313
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,379
going to have to do it backing up to

314
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,480
seeds real quick talk about quality

315
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,120
seeds place that I like to get my

316
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,740
vegetable seeds from is Baker Creek I

317
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,078
got some really good stuff Purple Lady

318
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,200
bok choy got some butter crunch lettuce

319
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:13,319
some bullnose Peppers some modus Ras

320
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,459
it's a sweet melon so really really good

321
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,440
place I know it's one of the more

322
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,239
popular places when it comes to like

323
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,940
vegetables I think they have flower

324
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,200
seeds there as well but uh yeah might be

325
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,459
a place that you want to check out not

326
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,980
sure if you have any sources of

327
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:28,078
vegetable seeds I don't um I personally

328
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,300
get when I do get seeds a lot of our

329
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,099
seeds are actually from because we have

330
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,958
a routine coming at our house so we get

331
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,879
a lot of our seeds from the garden so

332
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,679
the dill we have our Dill seeds from

333
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,000
last year I have my basil seeds from

334
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,219
last year

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,958
um so when I go into further in the

336
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,000
process presentation we'll kind of plant

337
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,799
those seeds of how you can do that if

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,259
you want to do that but in terms of

339
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,599
courses um if I do need seeds I tend to

340
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,458
go to my local guy

341
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,740
um and I don't I don't even know if it's

342
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,599
his Brands necessarily but I like

343
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,879
stopping in and getting there you know

344
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,379
growing zones

345
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,958
um hopefully most of you have seen this

346
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,600
and it may be some haven't it's on most

347
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,659
packets of your seeds and your growing

348
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,000
zones is basically your first and your

349
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,740
last frost

350
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,200
um this for those who are listening

351
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,539
there's a picture on the screen of the

352
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,300
United States and a packet of seeds and

353
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:23,159
it shows the U.S zones and those are

354
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,899
broken down like I said on the first and

355
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,719
last frost

356
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,659
um why is this important because if this

357
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,240
is all about your timing okay and and if

358
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,159
you want to start seeds indoors you want

359
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,259
to try to have the best timing I have

360
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,439
had timing guys where I've had tomatoes

361
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:43,319
indoors and they end up being way too

362
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,079
big and it wasn't a lost cause I planted

363
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,760
them sideways underground and the root

364
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,039
system was amazing because that whole

365
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,500
stem will grow roots so a two football

366
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,778
two foot tall plant laid down sideways

367
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,360
it worked but it could have been

368
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:00,059
prevented if I paid more attention to my

369
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,159
zone and timed it a little bit

370
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,078
differently

371
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:06,179
you're you're out in Nevada and you can

372
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,439
see like you have a whole bunch of

373
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,479
different ranges obviously because you

374
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,820
have mountains and Flatlands and

375
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,039
foothills yeah I'm down on the southern

376
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,440
tip there actually in zone nine which

377
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,659
you don't have have listed there 9A

378
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,120
actually so yeah desert region for me

379
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,578
yeah yep and then that's that goes to

380
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,620
you know what's going to be suited for

381
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:28,620
your region too

382
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,659
um you know and that's that's

383
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,639
um for for in terms of for planning and

384
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,379
what crops may or may not be conducive

385
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,899
the planting cycle we're going to get

386
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,659
into this very basic planting feeding

387
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,698
watering and harvesting so when I kind

388
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:44,639
of break this down I want you guys to

389
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:47,458
think like okay planting what am I

390
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,440
planting when do I need to plant it how

391
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,479
much do I need to plant

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,459
um and ask more in-depth questions to

393
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,100
yourself so planting know when your crop

394
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,138
can be planted take advantage of with

395
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,000
plants that can be sowed in the fall or

396
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,600
in early spring

397
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,519
um

398
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,860
feeding what are the plants feeding

399
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,778
demands are you planting a plant That's

400
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Heavy feeding next to one that may not

401
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,439
have as much of a

402
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,539
fertilizing demand and causing an access

403
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,820
watering so how much do you need the how

404
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,860
much does the individual crops need to

405
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,720
be watered if one type of plant requires

406
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,220
High volumes of water you wouldn't want

407
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,139
to buy more sensitive plants that

408
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,540
require less watering and then

409
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,579
harvesting understand the potential

410
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,159
Harvest dates and how to prepare for

411
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,259
them depending on the crop it's at this

412
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,659
time that you can plant for a second

413
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,819
harvest so it for those that don't see

414
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,319
the visual there's planting feeding

415
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,079
watering and harvesting and then there's

416
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,120
arrows cycling back around because if

417
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,739
you understand your your timing of your

418
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,078
planting and you're when you're going to

419
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,100
be harvesting you can potentially sow in

420
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:54,659
two or a third one depending on the crop

421
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,759
and with harvesting

422
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,500
this is extremely important harvesting

423
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,600
windows are especially important when it

424
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,000
comes to preserving for your Harvest to

425
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,639
ensure longevity you need the freshest

426
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,039
produce and the timing is everything so

427
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,079
if you kind of go back to okay I want to

428
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,480
can what do I want to can I want to

429
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,399
plant tomatoes but you have to ask

430
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,800
yourself what kind of tomatoes because

431
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
if you plant the variety that's going to

432
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,338
give you

433
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,379
some Tomatoes trickling in through the

434
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,180
summer and into the fall you're probably

435
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,698
not going to have enough to be to

436
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,099
efficiently be able to can your tomatoes

437
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,838
so you need to get the variety that

438
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,879
you're going to harvest most of them

439
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,839
towards the end of the Fall that way

440
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:39,120
you're picking the ripest and the most

441
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,339
of your Harvest and then washing

442
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,560
prepping and canning and this is where

443
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,160
your timing is everything moving on

444
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,859
garden layout understand the orientation

445
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,778
of your garden

446
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,220
North East Southwest you know where is

447
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,620
the sun coming up where is the sun

448
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,560
coming down where are you going to get

449
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,139
the most sun and this isn't always the

450
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,599
the most important thing but most crops

451
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,279
are going to require full sun there are

452
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,058
some that are going to require partial

453
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,039
or more light amounts of Sun Well parts

454
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,078
of the garden have long durations of

455
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,259
shade once again this is not a bad thing

456
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,838
I have a small little tree that during

457
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,879
mid-summer it Shades a portion of my

458
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,818
garden but I'm able to plant in like

459
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,260
another row of lettuce and the Heat of

460
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,879
the summer is not going to make it go

461
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,379
bitter because it's underneath the

462
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,600
shading and it still gets enough light

463
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,299
to photosynthesize and produce quality

464
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,219
vegetables you know are you growing

465
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,200
plants that have low light requirements

466
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,120
and it goes to the same mindset what are

467
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,160
the requirements of the plant what am I

468
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,099
planting what am I feeding it just kind

469
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,840
of keeps repeating in our head are you

470
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:48,298
are you growing plants that have low

471
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,418
light requirements if you're planting

472
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,940
fruiting trees how big will they get

473
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,799
same thing with annuals and if you see

474
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,019
on the screen this is actually when me

475
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:02,220
and my kids designed our garden

476
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:04,379
and there's two apple trees and we

477
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,660
planted them I think we figure like

478
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,820
eight years worth of growth

479
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,558
um so depending on how I prune them and

480
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,899
how big they're going to get it's not

481
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,298
good as shade that part of my garden

482
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,220
where I'm growing my vegetables and then

483
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,558
in front of my garden you'll see four

484
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,519
little circles and that is where we put

485
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:28,139
our raspberries and as of this year that

486
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,700
is a wall of raspberries so it's four so

487
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,559
kind of knowing your plants and what

488
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,538
you're planting I didn't have to spend

489
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,519
all this money to fill it up the first

490
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:37,980
year I just bought four mother plants

491
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,918
and now it's a complete wall and I can

492
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,900
probably pull out 10 to 20 maybe more

493
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,840
babies every year and plant them around

494
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,580
different parts of my land or give them

495
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,259
the neighbors and have them start their

496
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,659
Gardens you know that's awesome what did

497
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:54,240
you use to make this to be honest with

498
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,058
you this was some free thing that I

499
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,279
Googled online and people used it it's

500
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,200
kind of like um how some websites do

501
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,960
grow logs where people can keep track of

502
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,080
their grow logs this was one kind of

503
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,880
that was free and a lot it wasn't user

504
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,740
friendly though it's like outdated it

505
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,600
was like I want to do this and it's like

506
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,880
you know working in paint but it's a

507
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,099
really cool concept and it got enough

508
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,020
for where yeah this is my plan this is

509
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,639
my lot and this is what I want to do and

510
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,798
in the back corner behind the shed you

511
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,538
can see that that's the newer the the

512
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,740
newer plot that we put in and last year

513
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,079
we did

514
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,298
potatoes I think we did all potatoes

515
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,099
there last year nice yeah I know some

516
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,960
people probably wondering where that

517
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,759
came from because having a mapping tool

518
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,620
through software seems like it could

519
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,839
definitely be valuable to map things out

520
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,219
just like you show here it is and but

521
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,899
never rule out

522
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,819
um the whole notebook you know I have

523
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,919
notebooks filled of old Garden drawings

524
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:50,460
and I and I go back to them to see my

525
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,900
mindset to see what I was thinking

526
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,400
um you know and take this line you know

527
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,620
what direction do you want to plant your

528
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,720
rose and if someone asked me I

529
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:00,119
personally plant mine running north

530
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,700
south because the sun is rising East

531
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,298
West and I plant normally my tomato

532
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,700
plants will can go on the it would be

533
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,980
the east side that way as the sun comes

534
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,779
up and they're they're not shading the

535
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,400
plants of you know the rest of the

536
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,960
plants have their all-day sun and the

537
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,840
bigger plants are not shading the other

538
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,360
plants but at the same time I do have

539
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,339
other rows that go East-West like my

540
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,439
onions my carrots because they're just

541
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:28,439
small and the Sun is there and they take

542
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,820
it and nothing Shades them out but once

543
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,580
again these are things that you can

544
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,619
consider some things fall under the Bro

545
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,899
Science and I don't matter which way you

546
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,178
plant them then you know that's what you

547
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,860
connect with nice nice well let's move

548
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,960
on to the next slide here I won't I

549
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,459
won't try not to interrupt you as much I

550
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,679
know you got quite a few slides left to

551
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,480
go so I'll let you do your thing okay so

552
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,580
the next one is growing media and

553
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,400
nutrient delivery and this is very basic

554
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,639
so if you are having to do raised beds

555
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,500
if you're on a deck patio consider the

556
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,720
differences between growing Medias and

557
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,700
their water holding capacities when

558
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,640
planting raised beds are planting in

559
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,519
pots so just outlining organic soils

560
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,640
pure peat moss pure Cocos and this kind

561
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,619
of goes into your schedule you know how

562
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,840
much you're going to have to water and

563
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,699
if you have a soil that maybe holds more

564
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,859
water it might be more conducive for

565
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,240
your your lifestyle when you're out at

566
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:22,859
work and you come home they're not just

567
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,259
wilted because they can't even make it

568
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,479
that far into the day without needing

569
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,058
water this is where Annoying your soil

570
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,120
the cohesions and stuff will will help

571
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:35,339
you and then from there for your your

572
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,779
nutrient delivery we basically you know

573
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:39,658
I look at is we have organic dry

574
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:43,139
amendments organic liquids synthetics

575
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:45,419
and then synganics dry amendments are

576
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,380
basically just different forms uh

577
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,380
granular sizes

578
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,440
materials in nature comes in many

579
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,319
reduced size forms requires biology to

580
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,679
break down organic liquids or you know

581
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,240
as their certifications

582
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,759
synthetics are just man-made ionic forms

583
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,380
and then we have synganic synganics

584
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,538
which is a blend of amendments and

585
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,400
synthetic liquids mostly in my opinion

586
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,619
it seems like people favor Organics and

587
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,140
they just use that little bit in between

588
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,259
what they need but I think it's

589
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,120
important that you kind of narrow in

590
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:19,859
your your methods so that you don't end

591
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,319
up wasting a lot of money and having a

592
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,939
shelf filled with a lot of varieties of

593
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,379
things take your time when you're doing

594
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,058
your research and picking your

595
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,440
deliveries system for those are

596
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,940
listening you can't see it on screen but

597
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,919
I have a picture of one of our family

598
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,259
peppers and when we cut it open there's

599
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,000
like a perfect smiley face so I wrote

600
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,038
Nature is always showing us how happy it

601
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,720
could be and we're eating dinner and I

602
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:41,579
cut it open and I called the kids over

603
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,440
and I said see we know we're doing a

604
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,119
good job and I showed it to them you

605
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,980
know and they're like what you know it

606
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,259
was it was one of those moments where

607
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,659
you know they've really connected with

608
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:54,000
their hard work you know and they got to

609
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,720
pick it and cut it and see how happy it

610
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,359
was

611
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,460
so going into that it's keep it fun

612
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,899
don't feel the need to incorporate all

613
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,960
the growing methods and techniques at

614
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,880
once you are not going to want to do all

615
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,919
techniques that are oh and that's okay

616
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,140
and I kind of said that before I like

617
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,140
composting and fermenting but I probably

618
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,720
won't get into jadam practices

619
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,480
um for me it's try one new technique or

620
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,000
new fertilizer a year connect with the

621
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,980
visual responses that you see and try to

622
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,200
understand why it may have worked or why

623
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,940
it may have not worked adding too many

624
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,058
things at once may lead to compound

625
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,460
issues and and or you not understanding

626
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:35,038
why it worked or failed so it's like

627
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,159
okay what can I start off with well get

628
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,859
a good basic all-purpose 444 see how

629
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,600
your plants and your soils respond and

630
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,879
if you're kind of missing something pick

631
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:48,058
it up you know but

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,500
starting all these methods and okay I'm

633
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,058
going to do fermenting in this and then

634
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,400
you just next thing you know you have a

635
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:56,220
petri dish of and it's hard to go back

636
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,340
once you do so don't compare your garden

637
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,259
to others love what you can love what

638
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,939
you have created and provided within

639
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,400
your means all good things come with

640
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,860
time I do this all the time as an artist

641
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,480
as a gardener I'm looking at other

642
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:11,219
people's paintings and I'm like oh God

643
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,900
but then I think to myself I'm not

644
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,880
trying to paint that realism I'm trying

645
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,440
to paint what I'm painting and it goes

646
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,600
with the same thing you'll see some

647
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,058
beautiful gardens and people that want

648
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,558
to pick every weed out I'm not that

649
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:25,740
person I want those weeds in the ground

650
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,200
in the soil so I have an advantage of I

651
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,079
don't weed in my garden learn together

652
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,940
grow together guys if we all learn

653
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,740
different we all learn differently and

654
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,860
we all have our own unique personalities

655
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,319
and we we need to bring this out let

656
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,538
your kids explore and find what sparks

657
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,639
their interest I like to say as adults

658
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:47,339
our attention spans get better but as a

659
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,020
third 37 year old father it's definitely

660
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,939
not better and it goes the same with

661
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,339
your kids if you had this plan and

662
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,840
planting and doing all this stuff and

663
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,279
they look up and there's a butterfly

664
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,459
flying away and they're wandering off

665
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,740
support it let them don't make it feel

666
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,740
like it's a demand where they have to do

667
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,079
it as a chore and they're in there it's

668
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,779
2023 we you know we don't have food

669
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,178
rations we don't have we don't have that

670
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,038
economical demand where they don't need

671
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,720
that pressure they're so young keep it

672
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,240
fascinating and engaging for them

673
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,740
connect with neighbors and people from

674
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,480
your community you'll be surprised in

675
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,099
how many gardeners are out there and you

676
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,740
just might not have connected with them

677
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:27,918
there's plenty of social groups that are

678
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,960
geared towards your values and interests

679
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,538
and that's important to find those not

680
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,360
every group is going to suit your needs

681
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:38,579
or their personalities and and I'm a

682
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,859
part of some like jadam ones just to see

683
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:44,339
like what they do and they are talking

684
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:46,740
advanced stuff and you know and I'm just

685
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,480
like wow it doesn't suit my needs you

686
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,880
know

687
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,400
learn to network whether it's a farmer's

688
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,320
market on the side of the road stands

689
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,880
connecting with new people will help

690
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,240
expand your knowledge in your local

691
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,039
produce and local knowledge for me is

692
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,960
really really important like you can go

693
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,179
to your big box stores and buy their

694
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,038
vegetables and a lot of times they might

695
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,960
they have things that are not going to

696
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,579
grow good they just grow stuff and they

697
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,038
send it to these stores like my Home

698
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,500
Depot had lemon trees

699
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,900
like okay if I plant it indoors maybe

700
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,759
but I can't have a lemon tree if you go

701
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,559
to your local nursery and if they're

702
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,419
starting their their vegetables from

703
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:25,918
seed you can bet they're picking the

704
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,380
heirlooms and the products that are grow

705
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,640
to grow best in your region and don't be

706
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,799
surprised if they're things you've never

707
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,360
heard of where it's not a bigger boy or

708
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,679
bad or boy or you know there's varieties

709
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,558
of tomatoes but they have something

710
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,320
that's more conducive for your your Zone

711
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,119
and your region and you'll it just gives

712
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,740
you more success you know you want to

713
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,178
plant this fancy tomato but it might not

714
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,000
work you know

715
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:51,059
there's so many hybrids it's crazy this

716
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,919
slide is companion planting and it kind

717
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:54,960
of goes into what are you planning how

718
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,020
are you feeding that whole cycle we

719
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,700
talked about in companion planting is

720
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,460
when two plants are grown near each

721
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,860
other for the benefit of those plants or

722
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,679
both so that the benefits can be one way

723
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,379
or mutual and this goes it's not just it

724
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,140
could be flowers and a great example of

725
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,360
this is I grew up with put marigolds

726
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,340
around everything if you've looked at

727
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,579
pitches of old Gardens there's marigolds

728
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,619
around tomato plants to to this day I

729
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:26,220
have tons of marigolds and and there was

730
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:28,619
as used as a bug deterrent and as a

731
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,419
pollinator so a flower can be a

732
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:34,019
companion plant because it's bringing in

733
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,480
the pollination bugs the Flies the bees

734
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,700
to hopefully give you that crop

735
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,319
and on screen there's also a smaller

736
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,960
picture of What's called the three

737
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,579
sisters and me and my kids are going to

738
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,558
try this technique this is our one new

739
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,599
thing we're trying this year and it's

740
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,119
basically where you're going to plant um

741
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,459
a corn corn in the center you're gonna

742
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,719
plant squash around that corn and then

743
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,819
you're going to put you're also going to

744
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,159
grow beans around that the beans are

745
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:01,079
going to use the corn as a trellis the

746
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,600
squash is going to keep the weeds at Bay

747
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,000
the beans are going to bring nitrogen in

748
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,939
for the for the corn and through this

749
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,099
symbiotic relationships we we get the

750
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,700
benefits of the nitrogen being added by

751
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,918
a plant the the cover crop by the squash

752
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,500
and if you look at the pitcher there's

753
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,360
there's varying depths of roots and this

754
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,460
is another big great thing is the

755
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,379
variety gives you the root depths which

756
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,120
are going to access various parts of

757
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,919
your soil and depending where you're at

758
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,139
this could be really important for not

759
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,960
having to use so much fertilizer because

760
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,340
of the access of those roots exudates

761
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,798
and what they're bringing up towards

762
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,839
your plants I illustration there and the

763
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,058
way you broke that down pretty easy to

764
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,579
to grasp onto yeah it's really it's

765
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:46,619
really easy and and you know it the

766
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,240
chart breaks it down basically and shows

767
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,678
you variations if you plant corn then

768
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,200
you know you can do green beans and

769
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,419
cucumbers and peas and and once and once

770
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,759
again don't feel you need to but these

771
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,700
are things you can connect with and and

772
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,259
just further your knowledge

773
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,000
um and the last slide is just a little

774
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,640
thing that I say it's my quote it's no

775
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Garden it's too big nor too small no man

776
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,240
stands alone under the grace and the

777
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,460
Open Arms of Mother Nature may she

778
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,259
forgive guide bless and lead us to the

779
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,360
steward the land for all and I really

780
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:17,640
believe that I love connecting with new

781
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,519
people I love sharing my techniques and

782
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,100
and helping them start their Gardens and

783
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,980
it's it's really big in my life and and

784
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,778
I think together in the communities you

785
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,700
know this is the way we're going you

786
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:31,679
know where we're more self-aware of

787
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,380
what's on the shelves and what we do

788
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,720
want as consumers and it starts with us

789
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,539
it starts in your backyard starts in a

790
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,419
pot on your patio and and from there

791
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:45,359
it's just years of growth and and

792
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:47,220
amazing food amazing food that's awesome

793
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,259

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
regards to Family Guy gardening and I

820
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,538
know I didn't send these to you in

821
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,500
advance so some of them are off the cusp

822
00:30:54,538 --> 00:31:00,960
here but uh so introducing kids to

823
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,880
gardening you know what age kind of do

824
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,919
you recommend to get them involved and

825
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
when you're getting them involved what

826
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,000
kind of tasks can they help out with to

827
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,580
begin

828
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,259
amazing question amazing question

829
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,720
as soon as their diaper can put their

830
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:17,940
butt in the soil you know and you know

831
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,259
from they don't even have to be crawling

832
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,419
yet you know

833
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,158
um simple things like plastic shovels

834
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,320
plastic rakes you know you got to use

835
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,059
your your senses and what's going to

836
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,220
keep the child safe you can't go wander

837
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,220
off and leave them there

838
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,558
um but just letting them interact touch

839
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,679
the soil throw it in the air ah get it

840
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,178
on them seeing the bugs just the visuals

841
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,298
Alone

842
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,919
um will will keep them occupied

843
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,079
um and then as they get older you can

844
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
start introducing responsibilities you

845
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,038
know like hey can you dig the hole and

846
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,480
then they dig in and it's like ah it's

847
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,038
not deep enough like and you pull out

848
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,319
the plant look what we got to put it in

849
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,379
and they look like oh yeah okay and then

850
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,099
they they'll dig a little bit more

851
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,919
um

852
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,259
but yeah just to keep it simple

853
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,419
um for my family I was very fortunate

854
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:10,019
um my all my babies we had we made all

855
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,240
our own baby food so blending it and

856
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,619
then freezing it in ice cube trays it's

857
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,079
a perf like when your babies start

858
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,000
eating solids it's a perfect one serving

859
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,519
and then as they get a little older you

860
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,200
can give them two servings and so you

861
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,139
harvest your carrots you blend them up

862
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,759
make a puree freeze them bag them and

863
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,440
your babies will never have to have

864
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,140
Jarred food

865
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,058
and and so when do they start if you

866
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,159
want them not to be picky when they can

867
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,000
first start eating solids introduce it

868
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:41,039
and then when you're outside be really

869
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,259
like expressive like whoa look what we

870
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,640
grew like oh it's so good because if you

871
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,558
just give them that broccoli they're

872
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,600
gonna be like oh but if you're like oh

873
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,418
my gosh we grew this holy cow try this

874
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,418
and then like yeah Dad's right so

875
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,360
keeping yourself positively interactive

876
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,919
is what you can do nice nice and then do

877
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,658
you have like a top three or maybe top

878
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,220
five plants that you feel like is good

879
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,260
for family gardening

880
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,240
my top would have to be definitely

881
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:09,058
Tomatoes

882
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,839
um just because you can make sauces you

883
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:14,819
can add them into salads I mean just

884
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,519
Endless Possibilities with tomatoes

885
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:19,439
um cucumbers are definitely

886
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,740
um and I would see what would be the

887
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,399
last one onions for sure onions are a

888
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,399
key for me I cook with onions every day

889
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,579
so I need onions and they store very

890
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:35,398
very very well one last question from me

891
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:37,798
how do you balance like the time in the

892
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,879
garden versus family time like how often

893
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,700
are you actually going out to your

894
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,080
garden with your family and doing tasks

895
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,340
and then making sure there's a good

896
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,418
balance making sure they're not out

897
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:47,759
there too much to where they're like

898
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,200
kind of getting sick of it you know yeah

899
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,778
no so

900
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,179
what would be that balance the balance

901
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:57,000
is is is basically

902
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,038
as as much as you can is it that you're

903
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,898
willing to do and what you're what

904
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,700
you're trying to accomplish right if you

905
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,739
start feeling burnt out you're doing too

906
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,778
much and it's not going to be conducive

907
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,539
for you and your family

908
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:12,480
um knowing your crops not biting off too

909
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:13,918
much you know it's amazing to think

910
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
about a garden with tomatoes and

911
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,739
eggplants and cucumbers and onions and

912
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,740
all this but if you have yet to

913
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:22,079
understand how it grows your your time

914
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,819
management is not going to be easy but

915
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,940
if you focus on a few things that you

916
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,740
could be good at as that Garden grows

917
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,019
and especially if you're here in Central

918
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,519
Illinois in the central United States up

919
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,039
in Illinois

920
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,039
once the plants are certain size they're

921
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,599
naturally shading and weeding themselves

922
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,659
and the amount of rain and stuff we get

923
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,338
here it's very self-sufficient so you

924
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,800
kind of have to plug in your location

925
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:49,019
and and everything else too you know

926
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,519
it's not easy there's no good answer you

927
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:52,980
can't platform it it's stressful at

928
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,079
times you miss stuff and

929
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,539
you just gotta figure it out I guess huh

930
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,819
yeah you figure it out yeah exactly so

931
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,619
you have any final tips any final advice

932
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,559
that you want to give people here before

933
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:07,320
we wrap things up just keep it fun keep

934
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,259
it fun and don't let other people stress

935
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,940
you out and and you'll be just fine

936
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,680
um be open to share your knowledge with

937
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,900
neighbors and friends and people because

938
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,419
the more we learn that we're just we're

939
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,180
going to benefit from it and a garden

940
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,639
will really help you connect in ways

941
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:26,819
that is just unexplainable with the food

942
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,679
and and how you feel and the Domino

943
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,780
effects that your kids will have

944
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:32,940
connecting with their food especially

945
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,280
with the issues with

946
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,260
Could children diabetes and stuff like

947
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,760
this it's very

948
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,119
to the point to where if you can have

949
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,640
your child connect early on in that age

950
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,140
it's it's going to be good well said all

951
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:47,940
right so tell those listeners how they

952
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,078
