interview Mr ganx he is an organic

Gardener and he grows his plants in

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
small containers it's often said that

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,159
you can't be successful growing

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,000
organically in smaller containers but he

16
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,159
proves otherwise and he talks all about

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,558
it in this episode unfortunately we had

18
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,159

power through it we got a great

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,319
conversation today going to be talking

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,479
all about growing organically so this is

72
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,839
the way that you uh grow uh you have a

73
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,399
couple different grow Styles which we'll

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
get into here but yeah why don't we

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,159
start off with an introduction can you

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
tell us a little bit about yourself and

77
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,000
how you got into gardening absolutely so

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,319
I'm Mr ganx um from hom grow the

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,080
community and I got into growing right

80
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,000
around the 2018 Mark I think it was the

81
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,640
this may of

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,598
2018 um I got going for my first round

83
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:04,000
was outdoors and

84
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:07,119
um yeah I just got the bug right away

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,479
and once I got through my very first

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
season um I couldn't wait for the next

87
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,878
season to come along so I did all the

88
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,519
research I could possibly do and that's

89
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,639
when I started doing my whole indoor

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
thing awesome so you grow both indoor as

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,839
well as outdoor you got experience in

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,640
both areas which are two different

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,759
battlefields really particularly when it

94
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,318
comes to things like pests which we're

95
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
going to get into here in a little bit

96
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,759
I'm sure there's a a lot of people out

97
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,759
there that are in a situation that

98
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,039
they're battling pests and they want to

99
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,399
take an organic approach to elimination

100
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:42,199
so we'll definitely get into that here

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,760
but I'd like to start off with soil mix

102
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,598
so can you talk to us in detail what is

103
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,840
your soil mix sure um so I start with

104
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,959
promix as my base promix HP and I like

105
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,120
to use promix because it's bare there

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,400
isn't anything in it um you don't have

107
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,319
to worry about anything being too hot or

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
not enough of something or whatever you

109
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,000
can kind of pick and choose what you

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,158
want to put in there so I use Gaia green

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,799
as my the majority of what I put in

112
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
there um I'll start off with like the

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,280
allpurpose

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,560
444 for for veg and I'll mix everything

115
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,758
into the soil before I fill up the pots

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,439
and I I like to use like a 3 to 5 gallon

117
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,680
because my my setup isn't overly big so

118
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,038
I like to keep

119
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,680
it be able to put as many plants in

120
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,519
there as I can

121
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,360
um so I'll start off with promix HP I'll

122
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:41,519
add allpurpose

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:46,800
444 I like to use alphalpha meal um kelp

124
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:49,319
meal um I use dious Earth um oyster

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,680
shell flour I like to use that for like

126
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,680
my my calcium I add a little bit of

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,319
Epsom salt for magnesium and that's

128
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,079
basically it that I would add in at the

129
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,879
beginning and then as time goes on I'll

130
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,639
I'll do a top dress every couple weeks

131
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,159
two to three weeks depending on what the

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,639
plants are looking like I listen to the

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,800
plants I let them kind of tell me what

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
to do next if if I don't see anything

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,879
going on you know I'll just kind of

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
stick to a schedule but if there's

137
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,439
something that I notice you know a

138
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,159
yellowing or deficiencies of any kind I

139
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,478
I'll kind of Judge my next round of

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,240
nutrients based off of that got it and

141
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,800
then what are you using for container

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
size are you starting off in small

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,000
containers and then kind of working your

144
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
way up transplanting into larger

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,399
containers or are you just in one

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,720
container for the entire grow cycle um

147
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,478
most of the time I I like to go straight

148
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,840
from germinated seed straight into the

149
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,478
forever home then I don't have to worry

150
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,359
about disturbing any of the roots or

151
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,199
anything like that I've done the Solo

152
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,360
cup thing and and like I have the bud

153
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,360
cups as well I haven't used them yet but

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,639
Solo cups I've done that but I I really

155
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,120
like to just go straight into the

156
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,720
forever home so I'll go into like a like

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,079
either a three or a 5 gallon pot okay

158
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,560
all right so you're actually uh growing

159
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,478
entirely organic in three and five

160
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,839
gallon pots yes so it is possible ladies

161
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,639
and gentlemen there are so many people

162
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,719
out there who are like a it's going to

163
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,439
be big containers bigger container the

164
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,960
better and uh it's often said that you

165
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,399
can't be successful in 3 to 5 gallons

166
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,680
growing organically but you're doing it

167
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,198
and I know there are some other people

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,759
doing it a while Mr conu he is one of

169
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,319
the ones that do it and I believe three

170
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,400
gallon containers he's doing it and so

171
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,120
it is possible whether or not it's more

172
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,918
challenging I think that's a debatable

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,680
thing but you could certainly get to

174
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,198
harvest in smaller type containers when

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,879
you're growing organically cool so

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,919
that's what you start off for a soil mix

177
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,839
you've got de Pro mix Gia green 444

178
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,198
alala kelp oyster shell epom salt you

179
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,679
got some de in there eventually the

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,720
nutrients are going to deplete from The

181
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,918
Medium right so at what point are you

182
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,680
adding in more of those amendments it's

183
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,560
usually right in the 2 to 3 week Mark

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,478
when I first started doing it I kind of

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,240
followed the directions and I went every

186
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,038
four weeks but that that was a little

187
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,598
bit too late not knowing at the time

188
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,439
that things take a little bit of time to

189
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,279
break down it's not readily available as

190
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,519
soon as you put it in the soil so I you

191
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,679
know you have to kind of give it that

192
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,758
buffer time to break down a little bit

193
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,439
so if you can just stay a little bit

194
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,400
ahead of the game then really I mean you

195
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,759
don't run into a whole lot of problems

196
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,279
for deficiency wise so every couple

197
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
weeks two to 3 weeks is it the same

198
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,119
amendments that you mentioned before

199
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,959
that you're adding in more

200
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,038
444 alala meal Kel meal oyer shell up

201
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,158
some same exact thing yeah for the most

202
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:52,598
part I do I do add a little bit in

203
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:56,598
between sometimes like I I use hyra as

204
00:07:52,598 --> 00:08:00,158
well so I'll um I use their whole lineup

205
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:03,959
so I'll add in their enzyme formula

206
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,560
um I add in their uh hyren which is a

207
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,079
microbial

208
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,000
blend um also the the high Shield which

209
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,719
is more of a defense kind

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,478
of um it gives the plants it gets their

211
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,840
defense mechanism going and makes them

212
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,758
think that they're being attacked which

213
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,598
kind of makes them A Little Bit Stronger

214
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,280
more resilient I guess so there there is

215
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,399
a few things and and I do I do add teas

216
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,879
as time goes on as well in between and

217
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,958
kind of buys me a little bit of time in

218
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,360
between top dressings and stuff so are

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,119
you switching from the 444 to the 484

220
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,519
for Bloom at all or you just sticking

221
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,679
with the 444 guag green throughout the

222
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,919
entire grow cycle when I go into so when

223
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,838
I get to flip when I'm about to flip I

224
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,679
try to kind of schedule everything so

225
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,120
that I can do a top dress about a week

226
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:00,319
before I flip and I like to do like a

227
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:04,200
50/50 blend of the 444 and the 284

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,200
and then once my next top dress comes

229
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,160
around once I'm in full flow then it'll

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,600
all eliminate the 444 alog together and

231
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,519
it's the the power bloom after that but

232
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,000
basically again almost the same

233
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,679
nutrients all the way through switching

234
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,559
out the 444 and the 284 and so you're

235
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,879
doing a top dressing before flipping and

236
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,919
then about 3 weeks into flow and then at

237
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,759
what the six week Mark in flour and then

238
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,278
after that you're harvesting depending

239
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,360
on how long that genetics are due to

240
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,759
flower for exactly y as simple as I

241
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,839
possibly can

242
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,000
really it's funny that we talked about

243
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,560
Mr kanuck cuz I really honestly when I

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,120
first started I I based almost every

245
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,599
move I made in the garden off of what he

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,360
was doing because it was so simple

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,159
because it worked and he proved it time

248
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,159
and time again so yeah he's been growing

249
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,919
that way for so many years and uh very

250
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,759
successful you know he look plants has

251
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,278
some beautiful plants being healthy

252
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,240
throughout the whole grow cycle so yeah

253
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,159
that method uh has been very very

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,200
popular and I feel like he kind of put

255
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,078
Gia green on the map a little bit you

256
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,440
know what I mean I would have to agree I

257
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,439
would agree not many people knew about

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,200
guia green until he came around at least

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,120
the the YouTube Community became very

260
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,680
familiar with with guy green after he

261
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,839
came around so yeah so how about any

262
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,239
like sugars or microbial inoculant you

263
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,560
kind of talked about how you inoculate

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,360
with microbes but what about like sugars

265
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,799
any molasses or anything like that that

266
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,159
you use or no yeah I do I use molasses

267
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,919
in um when I make my my teas I'll add

268
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,120
masses I don't I don't normally add

269
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,199
molasses just in between like I always

270
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,360
do it when I make my tea walk us through

271
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,079
your tea brewing process cuz that can

272
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,639
vary a little bit as well some people

273
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,000
just use compost some people use worm

274
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,600
casting some people do nutrient tea Tu

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,278
us what's in your te Brew how long you

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
brewing and so on and so forth so in veg

277
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,879
I will I do do a couple different teas

278
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,040
actually I do uh a veg tea and I do a

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:10,320
flour tea so for veg I'll add my worm

280
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,360
casting I put it in like a little bag

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,120
like a tea bag I guess and I put I just

282
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,440
put it in like a 5 gallon bucket so I'll

283
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,120
put my my worm castings in there I add

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,040
Alaska fish fertilizer which is I think

285
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,360
it's a 511 mix so it's it's readily

286
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,159
available

287
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,440
nitrogen um I'll add that in there I add

288
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:38,480
a little bit of hydrozyme the enzyme

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,440
formula and I also add in Hydro Ben and

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
I sprinkle in a little bit of like

291
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,800
dinico type of stuff or great white

292
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:49,439
depending on what I have at the time and

293
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,759
I I let it Brew for 24 to 48

294
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,360
hours depends on how long it takes to

295
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,679
kind of hit that froth when it just

296
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,159
starts to kind of go off you kind of

297
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,958
know when it's ready it'll just start to

298
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,039
it's like when you shake a can of pop it

299
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,599
just comes right over the top of the

300
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,838
bucket so 2448 hour brew and then are

301
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,879
you taking that solution and diluting it

302
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,839
down in water before giving your plants

303
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,958
or you just taking that full

304
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,720
concentration and Watering your plants

305
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,919
with it I just do the full concentration

306
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,000
I've never had a problem yet I've heard

307
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:27,319
of people that do that dilute it they

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,120
cut it in half or you know they'll

309
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,519
they'll add 25% more water whatever it

310
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,600
is that they do but personally I've

311
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,078
always just given it the concentrated

312
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,278
mix and I missed it are you Brewing it

313
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,799
in like a a small five gallon bucket or

314
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,600
you in like a larger bucket or what it's

315
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,078
actually like an eight I think it's an 8

316
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,800
gallon bucket it's like a like a wine

317
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,638
making bucket and uh I put about 5

318
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,439
gallons in there just to kind of give it

319
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,320
that room so I don't boil over it's a

320
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,000
little bit cleaner for me and are you

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
doing that like on a weekly basis or

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,799
bi-weekly basis or how often usually

323
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,240
about every 2 weeks but for sure when I

324
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,799
do my top dressing I like to I like to

325
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,759
work it out so that I can do my tea at

326
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,879
the same time as I do my top dress so

327
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,159
I'll top dress first and then I'll I'll

328
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,399
water in my tea and in in my head maybe

329
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,519
it's right maybe it's wrong but in in my

330
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720
head it helps break everything down

331
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,959
maybe a little bit faster I'm you know

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,000
rejuvenating the the microbes that are

333
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,759
already in the soil plus adding more

334
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,240
microbes adding a little bit of sugar

335
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,480
and I to me it just it helps break

336
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
everything down just a little bit

337
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,159
quicker plus it's it's readily available

338
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,519
nutrients for your plants right now so

339
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,198
awesome now how about earthworms are you

340
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,600
using those in your garden at all or or

341
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,439
no I was I was I had a little worm a

342
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,959
worm bin going and I was doing it

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,759
indoors and it just got to be too much

344
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,479
for the space that I have and and I

345
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,360
ended up letting them letting them all

346
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,639
go out in the garden but uh so long

347
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,480
story short I guess I don't I don't use

348
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,959
Earth worms now but I do use worm

349
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,079
casting so I'm still getting the benefit

350
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,958
from them but I'm not using the actual

351
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,879
worms thes nice nice yeah worms can be

352
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,119
so beneficial in the garden I've been

353
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,078
using them red wigglers European

354
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,278
nightcrawlers African nightcrawlers or

355
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,159
there several different types that you

356
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,078
can use and I'm actually wearing the

357
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,198
shirt Uncle Jim Uncle Jim's worm farm so

358
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,719
that's where I end up uh additionally

359
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,679
buying the worms and once you buy them

360
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,160
once the population will multiply really

361
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,359
in the containers as well as I have a

362
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,360
worm bin I'm doing vermac composting and

363
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,159
taking what I get from there and put

364
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,440
into the containers and it's uh it's a

365
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,399
fun cycle you know to to see all that

366
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,800
happening and definitely worms is one of

367
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,958
those things where it's not a

368
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,439
requirement when you're growing

369
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,039
organically but it can certainly help

370
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,199
it's very beneficial for sure absolutely

371
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,639
well I mean it does so much like the the

372
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,439
worm castings do so much plus with the

373
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,519
worms being in there I think it kind of

374
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,639
like helps air raid the soil oil and it

375
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,519
just helps keep everything nice and

376
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,879
loose and Airy I guess so yeah they do

377
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,799
they do a lot and plus having a worm bin

378
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,720
like having having a a home for your

379
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,559
worms is it's pretty cool to watch the

380
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,680
process happen free worms for life as

381
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,838
long as you keep that bin going right

382
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:24,838
for real like it happens so fast so fast

383
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,959
I remember when I first got into it I um

384
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,319
they so being in Canada I went with a

385
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,799
Canadian company and it was winter so he

386
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,679
said I can't ship the worms to you right

387
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,559
now but I can do the cocoons and I said

388
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,318
oh yeah sure so we got some cocoons and

389
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,479
and it was um once I did the re I got

390
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,838
the cocoons first and I asked I can't it

391
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,600
was a ridiculous number way more than I

392
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,480
probably ever needed but uh I asked for

393
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,399
it and he sent them and once I did the

394
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,319
research I think it was like 3 to six

395
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,958
worms or something per per cocoon and

396
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:04,078
and I think I had like 3 or 400 cocoons

397
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:07,599
and I I'm looking at this going oh my

398
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,159
God what did I just do but um it wasn't

399
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
happening fast enough for me like I

400
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,919
didn't must my temperatures must have

401
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,559
been off or something like that like

402
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,318
there's a specifics that you got to kind

403
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,078
of follow and so I ordered a pound of

404
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,078
worms so then the worms came and then

405
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,719
next thing you know I had like a million

406
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,318
worms in this bin and I didn't know what

407
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,199
to do and so yeah it it happens really

408
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,559
quickly when it does that's funny yeah

409
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,799
you mentioned uh it's slowing down if

410
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,239
you don't have the the right temperature

411
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,679
it it will slow down like wintertime for

412
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,318
example my worm bin is the breakdown

413
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,359
happens a lot slower than in the

414
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:45,039
summertime when it's warm right so I

415
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,879
actually had some pests as well in my

416
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,639
worm bin and sometimes we get pests

417
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,879
within the grow space as well and that's

418
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,519
kind of what I want to get into next is

419
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,919
talking about pests what do you do to

420
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,600
prevent pests in your garden well the

421
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,679
number one pest I think

422
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,759
that any organic grower will have is

423
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,399
100%

424
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:10,838
gats um so right off the bat I tell

425
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,519
everybody be preventative right from day

426
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:17,678
one even if you've never seen one just

427
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,599
be preventative yellow sticky traps um

428
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,038
you can make your own traps out of um

429
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,119
apple cider vinegar with a piece of

430
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,000
plastic over top a couple holes poked in

431
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,599
it um I'll do that every now and then I

432
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,359
like to hang sticky traps at different

433
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
levels I like to put them right on the

434
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,599
soil and I like to hang them so that

435
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:41,640
they're different heights in the tent um

436
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:44,359
D Tous Earth sprinkle that onto the soil

437
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,240
um I use I've gone through a whole

438
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:51,279
different array of um sprays like I've

439
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
done the the crop Defender from Petra

440
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,319
tools um Lost

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,159
Coast um I'm trying one right now from

442
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,480
hyra they're new their new um Hydro

443
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,159
punch so I'm going to be trying that one

444
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,558
now and that's that's an all natural

445
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,919
different essential oils cinnamon is one

446
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,119
of the things that's in there which is

447
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,919
another thing you can you can use for

448
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,759
Pest and stuff like that um yeah so I

449
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,360
mean like I I I just kind of try to stay

450
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:22,038
on top of it right from basically the

451
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,639
day that pot goes into that tent I like

452
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,240
to just be ready for anything that can

453
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,240
come my way and if I do run into knats

454
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
or something like that I mean you i'

455
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,200
I've removed the top layer of soil

456
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,640
before put new soil in there um there's

457
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,279
a few other things that I've heard you

458
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,360
can do that I've never actually had to

459
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,158
get to like putting sand on the top

460
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,000
layer of your pots so that then they

461
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,600
can't get in and out of the

462
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,759
soil um yeah all kinds of fun stuff and

463
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,599
I'm sure I'm I'm missing some I'm sure

464
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,319
some of the ones that I do practice now

465
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,158
I'm sure I'm missing some of them but

466
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,319
well there are so many different

467
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,480
solutions to gats one of the ones that I

468
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,158
use that have has been successful is

469
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Mammoth can control so it's an all

470
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,480
natural product that has worked really

471
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,440
really well for me also the amazing Dr

472
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,279
zes another product that I used I've

473
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,960
heard I haven't used that one that one I

474
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,319
don't think has been available in Canada

475
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,720
for too too long I know I know it is now

476
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:22,200
so I think it's been here maybe for

477
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,839
about a year but I mean I I've kind of

478
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,080
already been fully stocked up on

479
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,759
everything else in the meantime so I

480
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,439
never really got a chance to try it but

481
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:33,119
mosquito dunks was another one that I

482
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,840
like I use mosquito dunks also mosquito

483
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,558
bits two different products there but

484
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,439
they're both BT type of bacteria that

485
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,599
helps within the medium there yeah

486
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,200
there's so many different ways to go

487
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:46,279
about it I have battled with fungus gats

488
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,519
for many many years I mean jez seems

489
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,678
like whenever I get like a new bag of

490
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,918
soil is kind of when they come back in

491
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,080
there so they'll come in with a lot of

492
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,640
bagged soils unfortunately soils worm

493
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,639
casting stuff like that anything yeah

494
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,159
anything organic I I feel

495
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,960
I feel like fungus Dan is one of the

496
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,159
easier pests to battle has there been

497
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,679
any other pest infestations that you

498
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,720
needed to battle besides fungus knats

499
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:15,038
unfortunately yes um my first my first

500
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,440
go at battling something other than Nats

501
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,079
was spidermites

502
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,558
and I'm no longer in that house that

503
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:26,199
that happened at a previous place that I

504
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:29,279
lived but um somebody had given

505
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,840
me a drawing rack with a bunch of stuff

506
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,678
in there and it was from outside and I

507
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,759
never I never even thought about it it

508
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,000
came in it was in a garbage bag I put it

509
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,599
down in my grow room kind of forgot

510
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,279
about it and then one day I just started

511
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,038
seeing webs looking around like what is

512
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,798
happening but everything was in flour at

513
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,919
this time so there wasn't a lot I could

514
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,798
do with spraying so I mean I would go in

515
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,840
there I would clean off everything that

516
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,599
I possibly could at the

517
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,959
time and I just tried to finish I just

518
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,558
tried to get to the end of then when I

519
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,159
got to the end I did a wash chopped

520
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,079
everything down and washed everything so

521
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,799
that was sad to see but I was so against

522
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,240
washing at the time too and then I felt

523
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:12,960
like I had no other option it was that

524
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,640
or throw it in the garbage so I figured

525
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,079
I'm going to try it and see what happens

526
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,320
and and that's what I did but I was able

527
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,240
to get everything cut down after that

528
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,639
and then I was able to do a full

529
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,558
reset disinfect everything go through

530
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,159
that whole room top to bottom with a

531
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,399
fine tooth comb and just sterilize

532
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,919
everything I

533
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,559
could so and thrips battle thrips as

534
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,480
well and that's since I've been in this

535
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,038
address I work

536
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,599
outside and uh coming home sometimes you

537
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,400
know you're excited to get in the grow

538
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,918
room and and when people say change your

539
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,720
clothes have a shower do all this stuff

540
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,799
like it it's true you really you really

541
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,319
got to watch what you're doing

542
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:59,798
especially when you're outside digging

543
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:03,599
and you're in gardens and you're in you

544
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:04,839
know grass and stuff like that you bring

545
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,399
this stuff in with you and you don't

546
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,439
even know it's on your clothes and

547
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,919
whatever so thrips is one that I battled

548
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,720
last year and uh Unfortunately they beat

549
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,960
me I went through I think every possible

550
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,919
measure that I could find and and it

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,278
just it didn't work for me I ended up

552
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,480
cutting everything down and shutting

553
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:28,679
down for about a month and then I went

554
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,079
through with bleach and a steamer and Li

555
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,320
all and everything that you can think of

556
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:37,359
and just cleaned and scrubbed and

557
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,319
steamed and scrubbed and steamed and

558
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,798
more steaming

559
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,918
and till I was comfortable and and I

560
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,798
haven't had an issue since so yeah

561
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,720
that's a tough battle and I'm I'm glad

562
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:50,000
you were able to salvage at least the

563
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,038
spiderm one that you had I'll never

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,079
forget I had somebody post on my Forum

565
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:57,200
years ago now and they posted a think it

566
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,119
was a short video and they asking the

567
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,759
question is my plan ready for Harvest

568
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,759
and this beautiful plant amazing looking

569
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,440
nug well top Cola really is what I'm

570
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,079
referring to and like puring and it was

571
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,000
ready for Harvest but there was this

572
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,879
massive web on it and then spiderm it's

573
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,278
all around it and I'm just like uh so

574
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,720
sad to see you know you have a Spiderman

575
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,440
infestation I felt sad because you go

576
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,839
all the way up until Harvest and then

577
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,798
like all of a sudden you're just loaded

578
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,639
with spider mites I've always felt

579
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:32,079
that's when the problem happens though

580
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,000
it's it's never when you can get in

581
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,240
there and spray at least for me anyways

582
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,558
it was never when I could get in there

583
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,440
and spray things on the plants it was

584
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,918
always like the last few weeks and it

585
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,120
was like that's that's when you don't

586
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,320
want to be spraying anything on there

587
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,038
you know it's so painful yeah I've been

588
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,038
fortunate enough not to battle

589
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,519
spidermites at all so hopefully I mean

590
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:55,960
yeah just got to keep it clean you know

591
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,720
I hope you never have to yeah that and

592
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,558
THS is another thing as you mentioned

593
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,519
it's as far far as which one's harder to

594
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,079
battle I mean I'll leave it up to the

595
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,918
folks that have the experience battl on

596
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,359
them I've heard that they're pretty much

597
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,520
equally difficult to battle I had russed

598
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,038
mites is like one of the hardest things

599
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,679
to battle uh you luck that's another

600
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,879
thing I haven't come across but like I

601
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
haven't had that one yet yeah there are

602
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,039
so many different pasts that you got to

603
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,959
worry about and indoors is one thing

604
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,440
Outdoors is another thing Outdoors is a

605
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,159
totally that's a whole another battle

606
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,960
right there just Outdoors alone past are

607
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,840
no pass it's that's yeah it's something

608
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,880
else for sure but focusing on indoors

609
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,240
let's switch it up a little bit I want

610
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,600
to talk about lighting what are you

611
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,399
using for lighting indoors so I have a

612
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,719
couple different lights actually they're

613
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,199
both basically the same light um so

614
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,278
right now the setup that I have I have

615
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,080
two two 3x3

616
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:57,640
T um and in one tent I have the mar

617
00:24:53,079 --> 00:25:01,759
Hydro fce 3000 I think and then in the

618
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,600
other 10 is it's the SF SF no

619
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,319
se3000 it's the equivalent it's the the

620
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,480
bar style lights On's Mars Hydro One

621
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,678
spider farmer so pretty well the same

622
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,200
light but yeah it's the the 3000s which

623
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,399
I think is like a 300 wat light okay

624
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,798
yeah I'm familiar with both of those

625
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,639
models now are you aiming for a certain

626
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,278
par during the different stages of

627
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,559
growth or are you just kind of going by

628
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,798
what the manufacturer suggests in their

629
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,319
listing description mainly just going by

630
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,480
what the manufacturer suggests like I I

631
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,839
haven't really got into the whole par

632
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,798
and VPD and all that yet that's I think

633
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,720
that's probably in one of my next

634
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,759
Ventures I'll start kind of testing that

635
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,480
and looking more into into the lighting

636
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,519
and stuff like that and I'll probably

637
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,278
find out that you know my lighting isn't

638
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:51,398
quite adequate but I mean I I've never

639
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,720
actually had those lights turned up 100%

640
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,119
in those tents so light CJs are so

641
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,558
powerful a lot of people aren't running

642
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,798
them at 100% you know what I mean I'm

643
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm getting away with 50 60% in early

644
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:03,519
flower you know so it's like I don't

645
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,000
think I'm going to be dialing mine up to

646
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,918
100% usually I'm running at 70 or 80% so

647
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,359
heat is an issue with with some of those

648
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,520
lights too I I feel like the the higher

649
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,319
you go the hotter I mean of course it

650
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,798
does the the hotter everything gets

651
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:21,079
right so I feel like that that can be an

652
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:24,720
issue too unless you kind of have

653
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,879
everything 100% dialed in which I mine's

654
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,200
up and down a little bit um yeah I I

655
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,559
just I'm usually like I'm no more than

656
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,399
80% but usually between like 60

657
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:39,119
70% at the end of flower so you know the

658
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,239
higher those lights go the the more heat

659
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,639
that it's emitting and it can certainly

660
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,079
be a challenge for your environment you

661
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,159
know for your plants if the temperature

662
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,839
gets too high I want to ask you next

663
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,559
what environment conditions do you aim

664
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:55,000
for with temperature humidity CO2 talk

665
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,200
to us about that um so I don't I don't

666
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,319
use CO2 I haven't I haven't gone down

667
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,679
that road yet

668
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:05,240
um but so being in canidate again I'm

669
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,720
going to use uh I'm going to use Celsius

670
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,839
here um I keep it usually like on the

671
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,240
hottest it's like 25

672
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,038
26° and in veg I like to keep my

673
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,558
humidity like somewhere up around like

674
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,679
60 70% but as I come down into flour I

675
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,398
like to drop it down to about 50%

676
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,559
humidity maybe even a little bit less

677
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:31,759
the farther I get into flour um which I

678
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,119
mean I find it harder the farther you

679
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,798
get into flower the higher the humidity

680
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,439
wants to go so I mean I'm battling with

681
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,720
that as well but um yeah I like to I

682
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,840
like to keep it pretty steady through

683
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,440
the whole grow like 24

684
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,798
25° and uh I don't like to get any

685
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,919
higher than like 26 27 that's when we're

686
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,158
kind of it's getting pretty warm in

687
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,519
there so and doing the conversion right

688
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,880
now looks like uh Fahrenheit that would

689
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,159
be 7 5 to 79° so I just figure i' do

690
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,519
that conversion here for those folks

691
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
that do Fahrenheit instead of Celsius

692
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,359
okay so pretty straightforward there

693
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,759
when it comes to temperature and

694
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,278
humidity let's get back into kind of the

695
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,359
organic style of growing a couple other

696
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,240
things that you can do cover crops what

697
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,678
do you do when it comes to cover crops

698
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,278
are you doing anything at all or no um

699
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,720
so I I I don't do it all the time

700
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:31,119
it's I like doing it I prefer to do it

701
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,399
it looks awesome in your tents um but I

702
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,359
have a lot of times what I do for my

703
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:40,000
cover crop is I'll add um crimson

704
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:43,319
clover uh y I think it's yellow Sweet

705
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,720
Clover there was uh red

706
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:49,439
clover and alala I think was the other

707
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,079
one that I had so I'll just kind of

708
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,399
sprinkle some of that in there and I'll

709
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,439
let it do its thing and um once it

710
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,239
starts

711
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,120
getting pretty high I'll just kind of

712
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,200
the chop and drop cut it down and just

713
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,599
let it kind of be on top and they'll

714
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,440
just kind of keep growing up through

715
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,798
there and I'll just re amend everything

716
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,440
through that and just kind of like

717
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:14,240
Shuffle it in with my fingers but yeah I

718
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,798
just kind of like chop and drop and just

719
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,038
let everything go back into the soil

720
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,839
again nice and right along with that is

721
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,480
companion planting now I know some of

722
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,199
those cover crops are considered

723
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,798
companion plants but is there any other

724
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,558
plants that you haven't named off that

725
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,359
are companion plants that you grow um

726
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:32,639
not not indoors really like I don't

727
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,759
think I've ever done any companion

728
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,399
plants indoors but outdoors I like to

729
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:41,599
put maragold in with my plants a they

730
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,278
look nice and B they're another another

731
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,158
kind of like Pest

732
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,759
Management so they keep some of the

733
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,000
animals away but they also keep some of

734
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,839
the pests away as well and again they're

735
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,798
they're one that you know they just

736
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,199
basically reced themselves and just keep

737
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,038
growing and growing and growing I'm a

738
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
huge fan of mar Golds yeah I've got them

739
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,278
growing Outdoors as well I really like

740
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,519
the way they look and uh it's cool that

741
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,839
they repel pests help prevent those

742
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,480
pests from invading grow space so that's

743
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,240
some nice color into the garden it's

744
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
nice and nice night down nice and low it

745
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
gives you something to look at up here

746
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,599
and it gives you something to look at

747
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,000
down here and yeah attracts pollinators

748
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,480
too if you're growing any type of fruits

749
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,398
or vegetables that require pollination

750
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,200
well you know growing some flowers in

751
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,479
the area can certainly help attract

752
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,240
pollinators so yeah beneficial in

753
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,919
several different ways how about mul

754
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,200
layers some people use that mulch layers

755
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,840
for mostly for water retention right do

756
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,000
you use any sort of mulch layer uh rice

757
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,278
hols I like to cover my top layer with

758
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,359
rice hols so I'll just put like a a thin

759
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:44,880
layer in there and as I water everything

760
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,558
it just kind of just kind of wash as it

761
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,600
down and then as I as my plants are

762
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:53,319
finished when I'm I like I I do reuse my

763
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,038
soil um so I'll I'll break dump

764
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,519
everything into a bin and kind of remix

765
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,759
everything up again but you'll you'll

766
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,038
find some of these rice hols made their

767
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,158
their way down quite quite a ways so I

768
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:04,919
think it helps it's kind of like a

769
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,679
perite at that point almost it kind of

770
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,320
helps air rate make it more more fluffy

771
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,639
and plus they're organic and they break

772
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,599
down and I'm sure there's some benefit

773
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,278
to to the rice hols in the soil as well

774
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,038
think silica I think was one of them

775
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:22,319
yeah silica is a huge benefit to the

776
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:24,519
plant non-essential element that has a

777
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,038
ton of different benefits so yeah rice

778
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,480
hols is is a big one there that's

779
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,558
awesome let's get into watering what do

780
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,440
you use for a water source and how do

781
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,319
you go about watering your plants so I

782
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,159
do use top water I used to use rainwater

783
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,759
but where I am now I just I don't have

784
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:44,799
the space to be able to do that um

785
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:47,558
so City Water super chlorinated so I do

786
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,200
have to let it kind of bubble for at

787
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:53,079
least 24 hours so I'll fill up a big

788
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,000
brute garbage pail with monster air

789
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,038
stones in there and I think there's six

790
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,119
of them on a big manifold with a pump

791
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:03,038
and everything so let it bubble for at

792
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,479
least 24 hours before I do my first

793
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,158
watering out of there but I'll get i'll

794
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,558
get a few waterings out of that brute

795
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,240
container so it's like a I want to say

796
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,038
it's like a like a 36 gallon Reservoir

797
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,319
or something like that so it's not huge

798
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,839
but it's it's a good size and I'll throw

799
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,398
my mosquito dunks into that water as

800
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,480
well let them just kind of be in there

801
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:28,038
and bubble with the with the airstones

802
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,960
and um yeah then I just go from there

803
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:33,798
and I just started actually um bottom

804
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,960
feeding I got the AC Infinity soft

805
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:38,960
watering trays so I've gone through

806
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,919
about half a grow with with those and

807
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,558
honestly the the whole bottom feeding

808
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,679
method is really starting to surprise me

809
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,038
I do like bottom watering had some

810
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,600
struggles though with Organics in

811
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,158
particular like doing the top dressing

812
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:54,158
and then bottom watering and then not

813
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,000
having it really Wick all the way up to

814
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,600
the top and and keep that top layer

815
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,079
moist where the amendments were but

816
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,439
having a mul layer or some sort of uh

817
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,678
cover crop will help with the retention

818
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,240
of the water up the top there so exactly

819
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,798
so and and every now and then too like

820
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,558
when I when I would do a top dressing I

821
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:13,839
would want I would want to do a top

822
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,038
watering at least for the first time or

823
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,959
two just to kind of get it in there and

824
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:21,200
help kind of drive it down through the

825
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,919
pot and let it start breaking down so I

826
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,558
I do I will add a top watering in the

827
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,480
mix here and there but I haven't

828
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:31,079
actually done them with Organic yet so

829
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,639
I'm finishing up I just finished up with

830
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,678
a synthetic run so I've been bottom

831
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,719
feeding with that so I'm about to get

832
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,200
back into an organic run with the bottom

833
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,240
feeding so it'll be a first where I do a

834
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,960
full organic run with bottom feeding so

835
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm excited for that little fun

836
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,240
challenge ahead of you mhm yeah I think

837
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,000
it'll be it'll be one more thing to just

838
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,240
kind of dial in and kind of figure out

839
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,240
as I go but I think it'll be okay right

840
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,359
so before you did the self-watering

841
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,278
you were doing hand watering I assume

842
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,119
how were you going about determining

843
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:05,759
whether or not the plant needed water I

844
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,598
would do I would go in and kind of like

845
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,199
feel the soil if the soil was wet I mean

846
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,440
then I know I don't I don't really need

847
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:16,358
to but I would also do the the lift pick

848
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,679
the pot up see how heavy it is if I if I

849
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:19,159
you know I go to pick it up and I lift

850
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,679
it right up off the ground then

851
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,760
definitely you know I've let it go too

852
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,358
long but I never with Organics I never

853
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,639
really let it try to get dry I never

854
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:31,199
really go for the dry back when I'm

855
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,480
running Organics so I always try to keep

856
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,559
them a little bit on the heavy side so I

857
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,760
just I just try to never really let them

858
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:44,000
dry okay and now with Organics do you

859
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,720
monitor the pH or the EC or PPM anything

860
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,480
like that or are you pretty much hands

861
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,398
off when it comes to all that I catch a

862
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,039
lot of flak for this but I I do I do pH

863
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:56,078
all my water and a lot of people always

864
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,838
you know again whether it's right wrong

865
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,160
doesn't matter I I just got into the

866
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,519
habit of phing everything from day one

867
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,920
and I've always pH even when I had

868
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,519
rainwater I still phed it cuz it would

869
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,159
sit out there and it would you know it'

870
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:15,400
be in the sun temperature changes the pH

871
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:18,159
hotter colder pH goes up and down so

872
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,599
yeah I do I do pH and I like to keep it

873
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,920
between like 6 and 6.5 is kind of my

874
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,960
range so if I hit anywhere in there I'm

875
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,760
good I'm happy with that okay so you're

876
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,320
monitoring the pH of the water before

877
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,520
actually putting it into your soil are

878
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,559
you monitoring the pH of the soil at all

879
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,920
like whether it be a slurry test or a

880
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:41,039
runoff test anything like that or or no

881
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,760
not typically okay if I if I run into

882
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,279
problems with anything like if if I

883
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,760
start noticing like there's something

884
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,800
going on with my plants and I and I

885
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,040
don't know what it is my very first

886
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,160
go-to and I tell everybody this before

887
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,318
you dive too deep into anything don't

888
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,279
just start trying a million things do

889
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,480
yourself a favor and check your runoff

890
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,480
before you do anything that's that's

891
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,760
always my first go-to so sometimes I I

892
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,440
do monitor that but it's not it's not

893
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,960
something I do all the time it's only if

894
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,559
I run into run into something understood

895
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,199
and then how about EC or PPM to get an

896
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,519
idea of how much nutrition is in the

897
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:21,598
medium no I never honestly I I had I had

898
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:23,358
an EC pen or whatever monitor whatever

899
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,240
you want to call it I had one when I

900
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,279
first started growing cuz I went out and

901
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,439
bought everything that YouTube told me

902
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,400
to

903
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,720
and uh I never really used it never

904
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,160
really used it like I've always been

905
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:37,959
kind of the same style of growing almost

906
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,279
since I started so I've just never

907
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,119
really never really needed it and I

908
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,839
found when or ganics a lot of people

909
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,720
aren't doing it it can be a little bit

910
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:49,119
deceiving because those amendments that

911
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,879
you first top dress in well they're not

912
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,400
going to show up on the meter they're

913
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,599
only going to show up once they they're

914
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,559
broken down in a bioavailable form

915
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,079
exactly if I was doing Hydro or

916
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,920
something I'd definitely would be

917
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,800
checking that but I'm not so I mean I I

918
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,079
steer away from that it's kind of one of

919
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,560
my my methods of keeping it simple I

920
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:11,519
guess kiss method keep it simple yeah ex

921
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,480
exactly why I mean I I over complicate

922
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,400
everything in life to begin with so I

923
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,240
mean if I can keep the garden somewhat

924
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,559
simple I mean that's kind of the happy

925
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,838
place right so got it now you mentioned

926
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,759
earlier in the episode that you recycle

927
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,239
your soil can you walk us through your

928
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,400
process how do you go about recycling

929
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,239
your soil soil so basically I'll just

930
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,960
dump once I'm done to run I'll cut

931
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,000
everything I'll cut it cut the plant

932
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,440
down I'll have little stock like this

933
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
left over or whatever and I'll go out

934
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,400
and I'll dump it into a big Rubbermaid

935
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,119
bin and a lot of people like to let

936
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,079
their their soil cook and they'll re

937
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,200
amend it right away and let it cook and

938
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,599
whatever but I I don't really do that I

939
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,879
just when I'm ready to go then I'll take

940
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,559
that soil and then I'll refill up my

941
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,680
pots and I'll re amend everything

942
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,559
sometimes I'll add a little bit a

943
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,440
biochar in there um what was the other

944
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,078
thing gypsum sometimes I'll add a little

945
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,559
bit of gypsum in there just to kind of

946
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,720
help break everything down and kind of

947
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,279
kickart everything again but other than

948
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,559
that I mean I just treat it like I'm

949
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,880
starting off with new soil again I get

950
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,279
to the end of a run my plants have used

951
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,880
up basically everything that's in there

952
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,440
and then I'll just I'll fill my pots up

953
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,800
and re amend as I go so basically rinse

954
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,480
rinse and repeat almost are you letting

955
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,680
those new contain cers with soil sit for

956
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,358
a period of time before planting into

957
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,239
them like they call it a lot of people

958
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,679
call it cooking you're cooking the soil

959
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,879
letting it cook for a while letting

960
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,118
those amendments break down before

961
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,200
anything is planted into it are you

962
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,440
doing that or you going straight into it

963
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:47,399
with a new seed um I'll go straight into

964
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,838
it basically with a new seed and

965
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,720
um like like I was saying like almost

966
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:57,920
everything's broken down and and used up

967
00:38:52,719 --> 00:39:00,159
by the time I tear everything down so um

968
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,720
that'll re amend the soil as I'm putting

969
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,358
it back into the pot again and then it

970
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:06,039
needs that like week or two to kind of

971
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:09,239
break back down again so when I put the

972
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:10,960
seed into the soil it'll give that week

973
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,919
or two to kind of break everything down

974
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,480
so by the time my plant is couple nodes

975
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,039
tall and needs nutrients again then the

976
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,159
nutrients will be almost ready almost

977
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,159
right on time so that's pretty much what

978
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:26,199
I'm doing as well you know when I plant

979
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,199
into I have uh five containers that I've

980
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:31,799
been reusing for six runs now I'm on my

981
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,879
sixth run with the same soil and uh I

982
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,000
feel like there is some nutrition left

983
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,240
over from the previous grow so that

984
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,199
allows me to plant directly into it

985
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,039
after amending not waiting for a period

986
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,799
of weeks like uh some people do but

987
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,599
other people they safe side they'll let

988
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
it wait for a couple weeks let it break

989
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,280
down there's really no harm in that so

990
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,519
yeah either way to go about it I find

991
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,319
too with like amendments organic

992
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:02,679
amendments um your plant really is only

993
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:04,119
going to uptake what it needs like for

994
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,159
the most part like you're really not

995
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,599
going to kill your plants because you

996
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:11,799
amended the soil a little bit too soon

997
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,720
you know if you're doing something

998
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,400
that's super super high in nitrogen or

999
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:19,480
something that's readily available right

1000
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,559
this second you know maybe but adding

1001
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,280
like the 444 and kind of doing it the

1002
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:26,719
way that I do it with the guy green

1003
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,040
amendments I I've never never run into

1004
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,519
an issue where where it was too much

1005
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,559
food for them at the start so that's

1006
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,920
awesome one of the things I like to ask

1007
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,880
folks towards the end of the episode is

1008
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,039
try to get some advice for beginners so

1009
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,079
we have a lot of beginners that listen

1010
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,279
in here what advice do you have for them

1011
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,519
for those folks that are just getting

1012
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,200
started growing organically be careful

1013
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,639
where you get your information from CU

1014
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,439
there's a lot of it and there's a

1015
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,838
million different ways to grow organic

1016
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,760
there's a million different ways to grow

1017
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:58,440
period but there's so many ways to grow

1018
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,800
organically and you can take the simple

1019
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,358
method or you can go the very very

1020
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,000
difficult method so my my advice would

1021
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,000
be find somebody that's doesn't have to

1022
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,719
be Mr Canuck but that's who I chose at

1023
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,039
the time pick one person and stick with

1024
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:19,118
their style and learn that way and don't

1025
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,440
over complicate everything by by trying

1026
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,119
to follow five different people at the

1027
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,960
same time just pick one person study

1028
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,318
what they're doing learn what they're

1029
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,039
doing and just kind of follow the steps

1030
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,279
because there's people out there that

1031
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,279
have laid everything out maybe go buy

1032
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,200
yourself a Mr growup book and uh and go

1033
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,760
from there because you learn a lot yeah

1034
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,598
there are so many different ways to go

1035
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,480
about it like we said a couple times in

1036
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,880
this episode now and I remember before I

1037
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,440
started growing organically I was very

1038
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,160
intimidated because of the new method

1039
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,440
and how there are so many different

1040
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:58,000
amendments out there MH and me really

1041
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,880
just not knowing

1042
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,960
what ones to use yeah and so yeah kind

1043
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,920
of narrowing it down there are so many

1044
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,119
different ways to go about it so many

1045
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,240
different amendments you can use in

1046
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,960
combinations I'm not a soil scientist so

1047
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,639
I usually just go with the Blends

1048
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,920
there's a lot of organic Blends that

1049
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,759
have a whole bunch of things mixed into

1050
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,079
it and you just apply this blend in veg

1051
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,559
and this blend in flow for example or

1052
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,280
there's some Blends that are kind of an

1053
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,519
all-in-one that you can just apply

1054
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,160
throughout the whole growth cycle so

1055
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,920
that's in my opinion the easiest way to

1056
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,759
get into Organics for sure yeah we got

1057
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,358
mention that one for any beginners out

1058
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,800
there not to get intimidated by all the

1059
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,920
variety of amendments that are out there

1060
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,440
they can be overwhelming because there

1061
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,358
are so many inputs a lot of people want

1062
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,000
to know can you grow with just an

1063
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:46,799
allpurpose 444 and a 284 of course you

1064
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,280
can to me it's like a multivitamin

1065
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,760
everything's in it already and you can

1066
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,920
you definitely can do it because there's

1067
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,920
people that do it and they prove it time

1068
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,280
and time again like we talked about Mr

1069
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,440
kanuck um

1070
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,000
but then you know then you're adding

1071
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,760
your supplements you know for us people

1072
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,440
when we take a multivitamin there's some

1073
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,960
other things that we might need a little

1074
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,679
bit more so then you can dive a little

1075
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,159
deeper into it and learn a little bit

1076
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,118
more like oh I want to give it some

1077
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,719
alala meal or I want to give it some

1078
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,640
kelp meal and then you kind of start

1079
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,239
learning what each thing does and then

1080
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,759
you can you can get as complicated as

1081
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,279
you want or you can stay as simple as

1082
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,520
you want and I guess my advice would be

1083
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,880
to to start off as simple as you you can

1084
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,759
and just learn it I think that's some

1085
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,119
really good advice for sure all right

1086
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,599
