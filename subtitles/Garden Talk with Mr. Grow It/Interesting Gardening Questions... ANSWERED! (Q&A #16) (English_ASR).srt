chat live and ask questions lots of

14
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,598
great questions this week I'm excited

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,420
for this one let's just get into it

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,119
my wine Fringe won't set at 60 degrees

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,219
only 54 would that be okay to stored my

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,738
Jarred bud in yeah some people do it

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,020
there's going to be mixed opinions on

20
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,578
what the optimal storage temperature is

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,379
I mean I've heard as low as 40 degrees

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,660
you know some people typical

23
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,640
refrigerator is around 40 degrees

24
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,558
actually I've been testing this the

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,198
other day is I put a temperature and

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
humidity monitor inside my fridge just

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,640
to see what it looked like it range

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,439
between 32 and a half to 40 degrees

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,179
Fahrenheit is kind of what my fridge

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,920
range that just random times opening up

31
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,560
obviously if it turns on and off as

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,219
needed but some people just store theirs

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,320
right in the fridge so 54 should be fine

34
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,599
some people are going to say 60 is the

35
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,699
best some people are going to say 68 is

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,158
the best and one company in particular

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,379
is the cannot roll so I got a control

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,140
back there shout out to them awesome

39
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,359
unit they have there they say 68

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,159
according to their studies is the ideal

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,239
storage temperature now once they came

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,280
out and said that there was a whole

43
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,199
bunch of backlash right how do I word

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,079
this without calling it bro science but

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,540
really it's more anecdotal evidence of

46
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,279
60 degrees being the ideal storage

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,020
temperature right where are the studies

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,219
I don't think there are any so correct

49
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,200
me if I'm wrong post a link in the

50
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,060
description if there's a study saying

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,740
that 60 degree Fahrenheit is the most

52
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,799
optimal for whatever reason right

53
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,539
anyways 54 degrees should be fine yeah

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
pretty much answers your question Mr

55
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,280
guard asks what's the best complete grow

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,899
tank kits on the market today well I'm

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,700
glad you asked I think happy Hydro

58
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,439
honestly does make the best grow tank

59
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,680
kits on the market today and they're a

60
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,439
sponsor of this q a so big shout out to

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,879
them they have a simple beginner kits

62
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,500
with everything you need really you just

63
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,598
need to add water so it does include the

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,400
soil I think they use soham living soil

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,079
comes in there complete grow tent kits

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,120
and they also have complete Rook 10 kits

67
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,480
with automatic watering systems like

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,500
blue mats for example Auto Parts so I

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,878
don't know if there's any other kits on

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,739
the market that's actually offering that

71
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,299
level of complete grow tank hits all of

72
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,280
them are built with AC Infinity products

73
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,480
so top of the line stuff especially with

74
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
their automation that they have with

75
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,500
their inline fans for example and uh it

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,479
also it's really cool I worked out with

77
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,939
a deal with them is they include my book

78
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,318
in the kits as well so I'm super

79
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,060
thankful for that one I'll definitely

80
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,619
have a link to happy hydros complete

81
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,239
grow 10 kits down in the YouTube

82
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,120
description section below and you can

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,819
actually use coupon code grow kit for 10

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,379
off how do you keep your lung room well

85
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,619
ventilated I think that's a good

86
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,479
question so right now my lung room is

87
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,759
really my bedroom and then I have two

88
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,318
grow tents within that bedroom it's a

89
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,179
spare bedroom not the one I'm currently

90
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,018
sleeping in or anything but I think it's

91
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,060
a 9 by 12 or it's a 10 by 12 room and

92
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,560
then also I've got a two foot by four

93
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,360
foot grow tent in there and then a four

94
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,780
foot by four foot grow tent in there now

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
I have it on a passive intake so what

96
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,500
does that mean that means that I have an

97
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,120
exhaust fan pulling air out of the grow

98
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,919
tent and then air is just passively

99
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,780
coming in through the bottom rectangle

100
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,419
intake vents right so air is coming in

101
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,459
from my lung room into the grow tents as

102
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,439
needed and I have it hooked up to an AC

103
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,878
Infinity fan and it comes on according

104
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,340
to the parameters right so if the heat

105
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,439
is too high 82 degrees is kind of what I

106
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,878
have it set at and most times it'll kick

107
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,318
on and it'll start exhausting some of

108
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,759
that hot air and I have it venting out

109
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,979
of the room into my attic and then out

110
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,598
of the house that air needs to obviously

111
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,840
be pulled from elsewhere right so it's

112
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,000
being pulled from the lungrum and the

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
air from the long room is coming in from

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
underneath like I actually cut a hole in

115
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,298
the bedroom door I want to say it's a

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,739
nine inch by 10 inch hole for

117
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,959
ventilation the bottom of your door

118
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,459
there's obviously a space right air can

119
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,080
get in that way so a lot of people

120
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,519
though just air will come in that way

121
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,140
however me I want to keep my lung room

122
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,180
dark at all times because having those

123
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,859
rectangle vents open on the grow tents

124
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,840
if there's light shining into the bottom

125
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,120
of the door that could interrupt the

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,259
plants right so I actually have a it's

127
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,959
not really a cover it's like something

128
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,639
that slides under the door two pieces of

129
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,019
basically styrofoam and fabric that

130
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,079
slides on the door and blocks the light

131
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,758
out and then I cut the rectangle vent on

132
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,500
the door and then I have some cardboard

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,419
kind of covering a little bit to point

134
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,918
it down so light isn't coming in through

135
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,418
that way at all right I'll give you a

136
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,039
long-winded answer here but it's just

137
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,139
coming in that way through the vented

138
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,819
door air is coming in as it's being

139
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,040
pulled out at the same time how do I get

140
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,139
my tent to not get sucked in without

141
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,939
having light coming in that's a common

142
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,519
problem right people will open up those

143
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,079
bottom rectangle Vents and they will the

144
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,639
light will be coming in right because

145
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,740
their lung room whatever room that they

146
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,060
have the grow tent is is lit or is it

147
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,800
lit at times when it doesn't need to be

148
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,240
so what some people do in order to kind

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
of get around that is they'll cover

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
those rectangle vents but they'll open

151
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,600
up the ventilation sock where your round

152
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,918
ducting comes out of towards the bottom

153
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,660
a lot of people put it down there and

154
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,399
they'll have it kind of wrap around and

155
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,259
then also put some sort of screening

156
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,599
mesh screening on the end of the the

157
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,160
ducting so that way as the things wrap

158
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
it around you're preventing the light

159
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,180
from getting in so that's kind of one

160
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,339
way to prevent the 10 from getting

161
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,538
sucked in on all the the sides I

162
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,799
understand what you mean by that and

163
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,719
then preventing the light from coming in

164
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,060
as well that should help you how often

165
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,560
do you chop your cover crop that's a

166
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,600
good question I've done it so many

167
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,220
different ways I really like to plant

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,979
the cover crop and then plant the plant

169
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,120
shortly after or at the same time and so

170
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:40,500
that way as the plant is starting to

171
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,139
grow maybe it's a Seedling and the cover

172
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,939
crops coming up but I kind of my rule is

173
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,400
I make sure that the cover crop isn't

174
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,019
overgrowing the actual plant so that's

175
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,478
when I'm cutting it down and now this

176
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,120
plant grows and it's bigger plant maybe

177
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,219
early veg or light veg and it kind of

178
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,340
covers the entire Grill pot where the

179
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,560
cover crop is in so I don't really have

180
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,659
much need to cut it back if it's going

181
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,519
too long it's kind of subjective to say

182
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,080
what is too long or not you can cut it

183
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,879
back but for the most part I don't

184
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,740
really need to cut it back much when my

185
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,199
plant is larger and kind of already

186
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,300
overgrown that cover crop so that's just

187
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,759
the way I go about it our PK boosters

188
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,978
worth the money can a plant use all that

189
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,960
PK in one go what's the best way to

190
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,599
utilize those extra nutrients that's a

191
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,758
really good question it depends on your

192
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,259
nutrient regimen to begin right I'll

193
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,979
give you an example I used to use Fox

194
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,199
Farm nutrients the their Trio and I used

195
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,060
to always run into well not always but

196
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,740
often I would run into phosphorus

197
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,180
deficiency in the middle of flowering

198
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,560
clearly see the signs of phosphorus

199
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,900
efficiency towards the bottom of the

200
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,579
plant starting and using a PK booster in

201
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,038
that case I use Beastie Balloons by Fox

202
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,318
Farm it helped out tremendously I think

203
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,180
it was weeks three four and five that

204
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,500
they recommend to use it don't quote me

205
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,360
on that it'll tell you on the back of

206
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,399
which prime weeks of flowering to use it

207
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,259
in something like that it's worth it to

208
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,418
add it in there now if you're not seeing

209
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,060
like a phosphorus deficiency or

210
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,740
potassium deficiency in flowering is it

211
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,720
okay to just add it it's hard for me to

212
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,000
really give you the answer yes you'll

213
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
need at it or no generally yes when

214
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
you're when you're increasing the

215
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,039
phosphorus and potassium it's needed and

216
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
it can definitely help with overall

217
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,219
blood development but it really depends

218
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,539
on your nutrient regimen so it's hard to

219
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,280
give you kind of that blanket answer

220
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,959
that's going to apply to everybody if

221
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,818
you could design a semi or fully

222
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,620
automatic system what would you want to

223
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,360
automate and what would you want to be

224
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,399
manual I really like this one because

225
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
it's been becoming more and more

226
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,418
automated over the years right

227
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,680
particularly with AC Infinity I feel

228
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,299
like they're leading the pack when it

229
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,759
comes to automation I mean once their

230
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,460
fan came out that inline fan pretty much

231
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,139
a game changer right you can uh have set

232
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,239
points for that fan to automatically

233
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,699
turn on and off for different

234
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,079
temperatures humidity it's VPD now

235
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,360
there's controllers that you can hook up

236
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,159
to their controller now is so automated

237
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,139
we can add in a humidifier you can add

238
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,060
an oscillating fans so kind of to answer

239
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,560
your question I'd love to have almost my

240
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,360
entire Grill automated I'm kind of

241
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,860
getting there you know with the ACF

242
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,660
equipment just to kind of a quick

243
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,660
rundown of my equipment I'm using the AC

244
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,180
Infinity grow tents in my 4x4 I have a

245
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,740
six inch AC Infinity inline fan I

246
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,900
currently have two but I might be adding

247
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,879
two more clip-on oscillating fans and I

248
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,198
also have their humidifier in there as

249
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,478
well their humidifier is freaking

250
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,580
awesome I like it so much more than any

251
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,800
other humidifier I've ever used it does

252
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,478
so well increasing the humidity in the

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,098
growth space and keeping it there even

254
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,899
when I have my inline fan coming on and

255
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,598
off but yeah being able to have the

256
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,158
automation for temperature humidity City

257
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,259
I'm a home grower I don't really care

258
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,059
for the automation of the CO2 I'm not

259
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,218
really looking to maximize yield I

260
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,079
understand the benefits of adding in CO2

261
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,060
but it's not something that I really

262
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,860
need to do me just growing small plants

263
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,199
myself but some people do that being

264
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,820
able to plug in the fans and the

265
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,019
humidifier and then being able to look

266
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,760
at my phone and having that all

267
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,440
automated through my phone which is all

268
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,899
that is actually the case right now with

269
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,399
the AC Infinity controller 69 Pro I

270
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,379
don't really know all the differences

271
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,839
between the controller 69 versus the

272
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,458
control 69 Pro versus the Wi-Fi Edition

273
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,560
Bluetooth Edition all that stuff not

274
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,239
sure what varies between those but all

275
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,479
that's automated right now and then

276
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,159
automation as far as the blue mats I

277
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
really like the blue mat system so being

278
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,179
able to automatically water whether I'm

279
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,980
doing Organics and just top dressing and

280
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,479
then having just water drip down onto

281
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,100
the plants and keeping that ideal

282
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,039
moisture level at all times throughout

283
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,360
the grow or if I have nutrients in the

284
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,219
reservoir and it's dripping down

285
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,320
nutrients onto the plant and again

286
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,019
automating that as well so I personally

287
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
am a fan of automation that's kind of my

288
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,399
design right now as far as future

289
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,958
automations I don't have my lighting my

290
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,639
AC Infinity lighting hooked up to my

291
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,139
controller yet but I need to do that

292
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,399
because that would be helpful because

293
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,338
it'd be really helpful too to control

294
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,440
your equipment when you're away right so

295
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,540
like if there's an emergency and I'm

296
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,580
away well then I can turn off my lights

297
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,439
and turn off my fans turn off my Chrome

298
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,480
equipment from my phone so I personally

299
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,519
love all that automation it's a

300
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,220
long-winded answer on that one full

301
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,959
review of the Canada troll soon yes I'm

302
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,480
working on it right now I released a

303
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,399
quick video on them not too long ago and

304
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,019
they got flooded with sales it was crazy

305
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,000
they said it was crazy sold out their

306
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,500
own back order for like three four weeks

307
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,179
now because their sales went up so much

308
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
they've asked me to hold off on the

309
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,239
review until they they're doing some

310
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,080
like website changes or something so you

311
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
want to make sure everything's good to

312
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,560
go before I release it I started doing

313
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,958
like a script on it and kind of writing

314
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,479
bullet points of pros and cons it's not

315
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,799
a paid review so I get to say whatever I

316
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,940
want and yes I am going to say some

317
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,379
negative things about it that's one

318
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,060
thing I never really understood is how

319
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,338
people can accept money for paid review

320
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,139
use I'm not a fan of that but uh but

321
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,180
yeah it's coming soon uh hopefully

322
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,620
middle of April it'll be out and I

323
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,000
wanted to be like the best review ever

324
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,320
so it's going to go over like a ton of

325
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,759
details it'll probably be pretty long

326
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,980
too they don't they're not giving out

327
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,659
any discount codes to anybody but that

328
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,278
page where I'm giving you if they have

329
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,958
any sales it'll show on there and also

330
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,759
that page shows like multiple unit

331
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,139
discounts as well so if you go to that

332
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,458
page I'd greatly appreciate it but yeah

333
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,259
I mean if you order now it's going to be

334
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,778
a month till you get it it seems like

335
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,980
everybody that has one loves it a lot of

336
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:59,939
people that don't have it obviously

337
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,560
they're complaining about the price

338
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,240
price is really hot you know I got

339
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,338
sticker shock when I first saw that the

340
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,778
price is kind of the biggest grape from

341
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,519
everybody and they're comparing it to

342
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,338
like a wine fridge they're comparing it

343
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,740
to like those egg incubators which I'm

344
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,959
trying to find comparisons and no mini

345
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,879
fridge they don't have like the humidity

346
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,838
control so I don't I don't understand I

347
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,458
don't fully understand why people are

348
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,019
trying to compare them to Wine fridges

349
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,518
maybe just for storage but the kind of

350
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,139
trolls are drying too I mean that's

351
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,179
probably the biggest benefit of it is

352
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,919
being able to dry in it anyways I won't

353
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,199
Ramble On more about that let's continue

354
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,259
on with the questions BK or McDonald's

355
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,940
for the munchies oh man yo I Gotta Give

356
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,039
it to BK and I know I'm gonna get

357
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,260
roasted in the comment section I know

358
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,360
this because there are a lot of people

359
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,539
who don't like BK they have terrible

360
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,339
service yes but I really prefer both

361
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,860
their burgers and fries or from

362
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,560
McDonald's I um kind of I want to say

363
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,778
boycott at McDonald's but like I try not

364
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,000
to get McDonald's that's actually a New

365
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:59,100
Year's resolution of mine is to not have

366
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,720
McDonald's at all throughout the year

367
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,360
you know for health reasons or whatever

368
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,459
it's good like I like McDonald's Big

369
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,940
Macs are good but I got it I gotta give

370
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:11,099
that one to BK what do you think

371
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,260
or McDonald's I'm sure it's going to be

372
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,180
a pretty split there maybe in favor of

373
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,179
McDonald's or maybe in favor of the BK
