1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,569
what's up everybody I've got a two foot

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,459
by foot book written right here

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,469
- time to have sent it over to me I

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,080
think I could get the assembly on camera

5
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,580
simple like I did with my blog video I'm

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,530
gonna try to how to do this in record

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,480
time I don't know if that's a record but

8
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,879
I'm gonna do it as quickly as I possibly

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,039
can if I blog video I did it full by for

10
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,129
growth ten assembly I try to do it in

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,510
under five minutes if you miss that I'll

12
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,669
link that in the description section

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,740
below so you can see it didn't quite hit

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,660
five minutes I was very very close this

15
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,969
is a smaller group ten like I said two

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,070
foot by full foot I'm still gonna aim

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,870
for five minutes assembly time let's see

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,119
if I can make it this time I have all of

19
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,039
the pieces laid out as efficiently as

20
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,049
possible I have the grow tent unraveled

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,469
this is the bottom part of the grow tent

22
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,119
I also have a second camera right here

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,149
that's gonna be pointing the stop clock

24
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,399
so again trying to assemble this as

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,620
quickly as I possibly can that goal is

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,880
five minutes or less let's see if I can

27
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:59,449
do in three two one

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:02:10,878

seconds on that one couldn't have ended

31
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,950
