1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,359
coming up on garden talk when you use

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,039
phosphorus that is impure you already

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,000
see that what you put in into your

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,480
fertilizers is not 100 available to your

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,719
plants over application of phosphorus is

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,359
definitely a problem both indoors as

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,879
well as with big agriculture it's crazy

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
to hear how many myths there are and

9
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,919
also like how many myths are spread by

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,719
some really big companies in the

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
industry potassium is crucial in both

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,799
veg as well as flour and it is actually

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,039
the only element that is not part of an

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
organelle in most of the binding when it

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,200
comes to fertilizers it is being done

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,760
through a mixture of pressure heat and a

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,480
catalyzer all has to do with filtration

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,679
processes how clean is the raw material

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
that you use

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,600
as nutrients manufacturers and brains we

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,718
should be open and transparent about

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,719
what's inside the products

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
what's up everybody if you that don't

24

episode i interview rico from dutch pro

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
nutrients he talks all about how

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
nutrients are sourced and some forms of

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,519
nutrients that should be avoided we

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,599
aren't able to get into all of the

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,599
nutrients used by plants but we do get

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,118
into a small chunk of them i'm sure that

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,719
we'll have a part two of this in the

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,199
soon so uh we already put up the

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,759
christmas trees here in the office i'm

95
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,518

96
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,959
ready super excited for this episode

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
today we're going to get into how

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
nutrients are sourced

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
so really the goal is for listeners to

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319
be able to look at the back of their

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
bottle and recognize some of the

102
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,919
different nutrients that are shown there

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,158
it can be confusing for some be aware

104
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,479
that some of the forums are actually

105
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,560
we should avoid because that they are

106
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,238
actually harmful to the environment so

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,318
we're going to go over that today

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080

you know i mean we both you know share

117
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,798
try to share as much knowledge as we can

118
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,879
and it's a lot of hard work

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
and you know you give the platform to

120
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,719
people actually to go to and it's crazy

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,879
how many people hit me up and be like oh

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
i've seen you you know at guard and talk

123
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,639
we've missed to grow it or whenever my

124
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,159
trade shows they mention your name and

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
we even had the situation a couple

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
months ago where someone came up to me

127
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,000
be like oh can you let chris know to do

128
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,439
an episode about this and this i don't

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
know if you remember

130
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,478
um and then i called job right and that

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,879
i mean he's a fan honestly and he was so

132
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,680
happy chris so thank you as well for

133
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,680
actually offering that platform to uh a

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,959
lot of growers it's pretty pretty cool

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
and i listen to it as well you know i'm

136
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,959
a fan of your show as well

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
that is really cool that's awesome

138
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,719
well first thing we do on this podcast

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
is introduction so can you tell us a

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
little bit about yourself and kind of

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
how you got into gardening

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,319
yeah definitely so in this case we go

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,800
back to the 80s i wasn't around then i'm

144
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,279
going to be honest but uh my dad he

145
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,079
started the dutch pro nutrient company

146
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,519
and he was a grower himself in amsterdam

147
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,758
and him and his business partner

148
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,639
actually um started to look into

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
nutrients to better you know like how to

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,879
grow

151
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,199
uh how to make sure your plants grow

152
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,319
bigger um you know have better yields

153
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,600
etc so that basically started late 70s

154
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,839
early 80s and then at 85

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,680
they really got heavily into it and then

156
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,439
early 90s that's when they came up with

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,600
the desperate nutrient line

158
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,759
and then from that moment on you know

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
they just grew out the company

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
so in this case when i come into play is

161
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,519
literally the moment i was born

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,478
the moment i was born i grew up you know

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,359
in between plants um my dad you know

164
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,800
telling me about it but i must say he

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
never really

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
pushed me in any way to do something

167
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
with it

168
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,399
but

169
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
as i just grew older and i saw more and

170
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
more and i read up about it myself more

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,680
and more i just thought it was so cool

172
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,680
and i think plants are so um undervalued

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,840
by a lot of people in this world

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,439
and so i really decided you know to

175
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,279
stick with it and

176
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,680
because i was so excited about it and i

177
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,758
just yeah things went automatic and

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
normal and

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,960
a pretty good sized company here in

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,038
europe i shall say we have our own

181
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,560
factory and stuff and then i branched it

182
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,199
out to the us

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,199
so that's where i come into play really

184
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
is the u.s side of things

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
um yeah that's been a cool cool journey

186
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,758
to be honest that's awesome that's a

187
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
really cool story so let's hop into the

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,038
actual elements some of these elements

189
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,159
some of these nutrients that are for

190
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,839
plant growth we're not going to be able

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
to get through all of them today you

192
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,439
know there are 17 essential nutrients

193
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,359
for the plants i think there's a few

194
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,519
here that we're going to go over that

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,439
aren't actually an essential element but

196
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,359
are useful for plants as well so we'll

197
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,360
get through as many as we can today and

198
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,598
then maybe in the future

199
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
if the audience demands it we will get

200
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,560
into a part two we can go over more of

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,000
it let's start with nitrogen so talk to

202
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
us about nitrogen you know how is it

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,439
beneficial for the plant maybe just do a

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,519
quick run through of that

205
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,279
maybe get into the nitrogen cycle and

206
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,918
kind of how it's sourced

207
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,119
yeah no definitely and nitrogen i think

208
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,359
is the most

209
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
well-known element as well so it's

210
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,879
pretty cool that we can actually start

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
off with that one

212
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,120
but yeah basically what nitrogen does is

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,960
it's like one of the building blocks to

214
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,959
create amino acids

215
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,198
and amino acids in turn is one of the

216
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,120
building blocks to create enzymes or

217
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
proteins you know enzymes proteins is

218
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
the same thing

219
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,478
and enzymes are pretty cool because you

220
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
need them for nutrient transportation

221
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,878
they you know like speed up the

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,879
processes inside the plant and honestly

223
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,840
without enzymes a plant just can't

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,639
function but again it all starts with

225
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,119
the building block which is nitrogen

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
and then furthermore nitrogen is one of

227
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
the

228
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,919
molecules that is needed to create a

229
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
chlorophyll molecule

230
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,120
and chlorophyll is needed to create the

231
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,680
green pigment which actually is able to

232
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
attract and use light energy for

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,959
photosynthesis

234
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
so nitrogen i think is a really cool

235
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,758
element it's like i said one of the more

236
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,280
well-known elements

237
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,598
and what is also cool to know about

238
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,758
nitrogen inside the plant it's a mobile

239
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,199
element so for those of you guys that

240
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
want to know like hey

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,759
where do i find the nitrogen deficiency

242
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
look at the older leaves the one at the

243
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,639
bottom because nitrogen is mobile so it

244
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,320
goes wherever it's needed the most which

245
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,519
is in this case the younger leaves

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,479
but the problem with nitrogen is it is a

247
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,759
very difficult element to attract

248
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
from nature

249
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,319
i should say and

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
for most of the time actually till like

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
early 1900s

252
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,359
all nitrogen that was used by plants and

253
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,000
to grow crops and everything literally

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
came through the um

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,120
nitrification

256
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,959
from bacteria and fungi inside the soil

257
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
and one of the discussions that i

258
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,439
sometimes have with people you know and

259
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
especially people that um want to go

260
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,640
back to back to you know to the old days

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,720
where they want to use bacteria fungi to

262
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,399
actually give like organic nutrients to

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,959
the plant which by the way guys i'm not

264
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,559
against organic nutrients not at all but

265
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,958
like i said one of the discussions i

266
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,319
have is with

267
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,000
with the amount of people we have right

268
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,560
now we're currently at 7.8 billion

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
people is it still doable actually to

270
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,199
feed the whole world if we actually use

271
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
the methods from back in the old days

272
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
and i literally give them examples chris

273
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,119
and i don't know if you know that but go

274
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,719
back three four hundred years in time

275
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,799
it was not

276
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,879
actually crazy to think of that

277
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,919
sometimes ten to fifteen percent of a

278
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,519
population in europe would literally die

279
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,599
off because there wasn't enough food

280
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,679
around you know because of a miss

281
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,200
harvest or because climate

282
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,879
uh you know wasn't playing its part so

283
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
yield wise there wasn't just literally

284
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,078
enough

285
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,599
food actually to feed all the people so

286
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,519
that is one of the things that whenever

287
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,759
i talk you know with people about

288
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
synthetic nutrients i always think about

289
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,078
you know tell them like think about can

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,120
we feed the whole world and we were 7.8

291
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,759
billion that is 5.8 billion more is back

292
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,278
in the 1900s um

293
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,240
yeah can we actually produce enough in

294
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,240
an organic way now coming back to what

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,320
you said the nitrogen cycle

296
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,399
caused like a nitrogenous difficult

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,959
element to fix it right

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,078
so normally the nitrogen cycle goes you

299
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:41,039
have plants that die off decay you could

300
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,359
plot of animals that

301
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,958
you know

302
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
in this case actually do the big thing

303
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,479
if you know what i mean and um the brown

304
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,879
part

305
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,879
i don't know if you want to say

306
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,439
yeah and and then the bacteria and fungi

307
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,519
i mean they start to work right so the

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
nitrogen actually in all the plant

309
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,360
animal matter that's being left behind

310
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,958
they actually first turn it into ammonia

311
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
and then from ammonia actually being

312
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,599
turned into ammonium and ammonium is

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
already one of the forms that plants can

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
use

315
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
and from that moment on it goes from

316
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,599
ammonium

317
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,039
to nitrates and then to nitrate which is

318
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,759
again another

319
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,679
second form of nitrate nitrogen that can

320
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,600
be used by plants

321
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,519
now in this case

322
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
like i said

323
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,159
the germans actually figured out a way

324
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,599
to speed up the process and to actually

325
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,879
fixate nitrogen so we could mass produce

326
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,040
ammonium and nitrate which again are two

327
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,278
directly available forms

328
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,879
and this goes through the harbor

329
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,639
bosch process

330
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,958
and i'm sure a lot of people actually

331
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,838
already heard of it somehow

332
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,479
but the process process basically goes

333
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,480
as follows

334
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,479
so first of all

335
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,120
what you see in the air like literally

336
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,039
like 80 of it is nitrogen nitrogen um

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,159
yeah like i said nitrogen with an n and

338
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,319
then two

339
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,240
and then a part of it is oxygen but most

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,079
of it is nitrogen so basically what's

341
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,399
being done is air is being withdrawn

342
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,638
and then methane is basically being put

343
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,559
into this chamber

344
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,519
heated and we literally talk about crazy

345
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,518
heat guys we talk about 750-930

346
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,439
what is being brought together a crazy

347
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,560
amount of pressure again we talk about

348
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,200
like a hundred bar which is crazy

349
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,599
and then basically what is being done

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,480
is it goes through like four processes

351
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,639
four different types of

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,039
process where methane

353
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,500
the air heat pressure

354
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,719
and in this case also

355
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,360
[Music]

356
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,519
when i say air actually being put

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,839
together and a catalyzer and in this

358
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,399
case they often use a catalyzer which is

359
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,360
iron actually is able to bind the

360
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
molecules together so it is able to do

361
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
bind the nitrogen

362
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,600
with the hydrogen molecules

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
because if you talk about ammonium which

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,278
is the first

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,039
directly available form

366
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,120
the molecular structure guys is nh4

367
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,879
which is one nitrogen

368
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,759
for hydrogen

369
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,078
now if you talk about nitrate which is

370
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,000
the second available form

371
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,039
it's one nitrogen

372
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
it's

373
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,639
an oxygen and then it's an it's a

374
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
negative ion so it's negative three

375
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,000
basically but it all starts first with

376
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
ammonium

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
and why isn't important that we first

378
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,319
start off with ammonium because there's

379
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,159
a second process involved to create

380
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,199
nitric acid

381
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,198
now

382
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,838
chris whenever you look at like a bottle

383
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,159
right of liquid nutrients you turn it

384
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,360
around and you look at like the sources

385
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,799
because

386
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,879
companies young

387
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,078
fertilizers we do need to state our

388
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,799
sources

389
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,198
you often see when it comes to nitrogen

390
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,879
like a calcium nitrate

391
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,240
magnesium nitrate but also nitric acid

392
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,320
right

393
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
and um

394
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,839
you you agreed to that right chris those

395
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
are like um

396
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,199
recognizable terms what i said right the

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
calcium those are common

398
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,479
very average yeah pretty common

399
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,679
nitric acid what did you say urea is

400
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
another one

401
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,799
urea is another one which is in this

402
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
case like a cheap form of nitrogen it's

403
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,319
literally one of the cheapest forms you

404
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,399
can get out there

405
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,320
it's also the one that is not the best

406
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,919
available to plant to be honest because

407
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,079
it's such an

408
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,360
organic product and

409
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,439
it's easy to over apply i should say

410
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,519
and if we can skip it a little bit

411
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
that's also because you were talking in

412
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,078
the beginning about bad forms right of

413
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,679
raw materials

414
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,679
and

415
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,958
often what is the case if you look like

416
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,039
big egg

417
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,000
is the quality of fertilizer that they

418
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,278
use

419
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,078
now you have to think you know like

420
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,198
those big agricultural farms that grow

421
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,879
crop or soil or whatever

422
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,879
i mean they don't really get the most

423
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,759
out of their pricing if you know what i

424
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,078
mean so they're easily turned towards

425
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,919
input materials that are kind that are

426
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,838
low quality obviously the price needs to

427
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,399
be low so it's often low quality

428
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,040
materials as well that they use

429
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,559
and unfortunately because

430
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,958
they don't really have such a good

431
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,758
profit structure it's difficult for them

432
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,599
to implement technology

433
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
to really analyze what their plants need

434
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
so it's easy for them to over apply

435
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,199
fertilizers

436
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,039
and a big problem what you see in the

437
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:45,439
gulf of mexico and i don't know if you

438
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,439
heard about it chris is eutrophication

439
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,639
and it's basically the over

440
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
up application of fertilizers

441
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
and

442
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
when you get over application and it

443
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,720
washes out of the fields into the rivers

444
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
and eventually into the oceans

445
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
why is that such a big problem well

446
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
basically and it's funny enough the

447
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,679
problem is is that

448
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,879
algae

449
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:11,278
they grow so phenomenally well when more

450
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,439
nitrogen actually you know ends up in in

451
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,078
this case the gulf of mexico

452
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,600
so it is not literally that it

453
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,919
kills because it's there's too much

454
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,839
nitrogen and algae in the plants they

455
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,000
just don't know what to do with it it's

456
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,279
literally that the algae just grow way

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,278
too fast

458
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
and what we have here at least i mean

459
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,278
i'm currently in the netherlands guys

460
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,719
what we have here is those little side

461
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,879
canals right

462
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
and it's very easy to just literally

463
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,759
only see green on the water from the

464
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,838
algaes

465
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,399
and basically what happens is that the

466
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,399
algaes block sunlight it blocks the

467
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
sunlight for the plants

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,799
below the water

469
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,680
and those plants those water plants are

470
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,000
crucial for for creating oxygen inside

471
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,159
the water which in this case all animals

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,120
need even underwater

473
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,278
so when algae actually blocks

474
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
getting sunlight directly to the plants

475
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,400
underneath

476
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,519
eventually you literally turn off the

477
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,240
oxygen

478
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,078
input into the water so that's when all

479
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,838
the animals all the fish everything dies

480
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,480
because there isn't enough oxygen in the

481
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,879
water so eutrophication

482
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
in this case literally means you have

483
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,240
too many algae growing from the over

484
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,679
application of fertilizers by big egg

485
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,359
and therefore

486
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
not enough oxygen is being left in the

487
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,639
water anymore or produced and then all

488
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,038
the

489
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,480
plants as well as animals under the

490
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,480
algae dies off

491
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,240
so personally i love technology i think

492
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
also indoor screens if you because i see

493
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,359
a lot of grow facilities right in the

494
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
grow facilities and the technology that

495
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,399
some of those facilities put in i think

496
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,400
is amazing to see

497
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,840
and also reduces actually the over

498
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,240
application of nutrients

499
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,199
now going back actually to the sourcing

500
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,400
of how in this case nitrogen is fixated

501
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,440
the ammonium that we first talked

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,679
is actually used in the osmo process to

503
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
create nitric acid

504
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,840
and nitric acid guys you often see it

505
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,119
with a ph

506
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,159
down

507
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,359
you often see that

508
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,759
companies use a form of nitric acid

509
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,000
to lower the ph in someone's nutrient

510
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,440
reservoir and basically with the oswald

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
process it's kind of similar to the

512
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,880
hubba bush

513
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
they don't use methane or anything like

514
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,000
that but what they do use

515
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,679
is the ammonium let it go to multiple

516
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,839
processes of

517
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,640
heat which is eventually the start with

518
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,918
a high heat and a lower down they add

519
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
water in there as well along the process

520
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,320
and by doing that they create an

521
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,480
environment under pressure that the

522
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,480
water and the ammonium

523
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,400
actually bind together and that

524
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,038
eventually at the end of the line

525
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
creates nitric acid

526
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,759
now important for you guys to know is

527
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,839
the filtration processes i mean there

528
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,038
are multiple plants

529
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,959
and what i mean with plants like

530
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,960
factories all over the world that

531
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,079
produce in this case

532
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,558
nitrogen

533
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,759
with the harbor bosch process

534
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,359
but

535
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,200
basically all the elements that we use

536
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,959
no matter if it comes from like rock air

537
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,440
animal plant matter you know what people

538
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,319
call organic it's still all organic i

539
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,519
mean

540
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,159
there is no 100 pure form of anything on

541
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,160
this planet so even with these

542
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,120
chemical sourcing as people would call

543
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,279
it there are still filtration processes

544
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,439
that needs to be involved to create

545
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,678
priorities

546
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,759
and as we move along chris towards

547
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,519
phosphorus for example

548
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,960
phosphorus is an element guys that is

549
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,440
very easily

550
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,519
able to bind with heavy metals heavy

551
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,080
metal like an iron heavy metal like an

552
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,119
aluminum something like that

553
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,359
and

554
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,918
when you use phosphorus that is impure

555
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,479
for example you already see that what

556
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,520
you put in into your fertilizers is not

557
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
100 available to your plants

558
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,759
and one of the things that we need to do

559
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,000
chris as a fertilizer brand if we want

560
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,480
to be registered in the u.s

561
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
is we need to test all our products for

562
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,319
heavy metals

563
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,919
and if the heavy metals for example

564
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,439
testing

565
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,640
turns positive or in this case it's a

566
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,798
negative thing of course because you hit

567
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,559
a certain amount of heavy metals your

568
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,038
fertilizers are not allowed to be sold

569
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,200
on the market because it is a danger to

570
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,359
both plant as well as you for human

571
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,679
consumption

572
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,000
and in the case of phosphorus you also

573
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,880
reduce actually

574
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
the quality of the material because it

575
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,440
is not available to the plant again

576
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,798
and

577
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,159
so like i said let's just move on to

578
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,599
phosphorus to be honest chris because i

579
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,520
think we have said everything about

580
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,839
nitrogen yeah so transitioning over to

581
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,679
phosphorus that's another thing really

582
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,599
that contributes to these toxic algae

583
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,919
blooms you mentioned that with nitrogen

584
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,719
same thing with phosphorus same exact

585
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,600
thing over fertilization runoffs into

586
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,519
these lakes ponds toxic algae blooms so

587
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,519
that's a big reason why a lot of people

588
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,599
don't use some of these

589
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,599
and you know it's kind of frowned upon

590
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
to use some of these in outdoor

591
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,359
environments particularly for runoff

592
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,558
into the lakes and streams and so on and

593
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,158
so forth but yeah let's get into

594
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,678
phosphorus a little bit deeper so how is

595
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
it beneficial to the plant how's it

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,640
sourced you know what form does dutch

597
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,319
pro use why yeah so on and so forth

598
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
it's good i think phosphorus is a really

599
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,158
interesting one

600
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,400
uh because of the history as well you

601
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
know like it's funny but like

602
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,720
if you look like sourcing it also

603
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,319
evolved over time you know often how

604
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
people did it back in the days and we

605
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,599
come especially potassium i think is a

606
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
very cool one

607
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,319
um

608
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
but yeah let's start off with phosphorus

609
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,599
first i hope you can see i'm very

610
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
excited about it you know so sometimes

611
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,359
i'm like okay

612
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,359
you know straighten up rico just one by

613
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,038
one

614
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,000
but yeah phosphorus so basically

615
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,798
phosphorus is a crucial element

616
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
in especially energy production

617
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,879
and

618
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,119
uh

619
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
a quick you know quick notes about what

620
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,439
happens

621
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,079
you got adp which stands for adenosine

622
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,960
diphosphate or d-phosphates

623
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:24,000
and adp needs to be transformed

624
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,880
to atp it's adenosine triphosphate

625
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
and with the adp you got two phosphates

626
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,159
involved and with the energy molecule

627
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,400
atp you got three molecules involved

628
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
so you need to apply phosphorus to your

629
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
plants in order to actually create these

630
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,640
energy molecules

631
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,159
and funny enough

632
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,280
all living

633
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
um

634
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,399
animals and plants they use the same

635
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,439
source of energy atp i think it's

636
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
amazing

637
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
um

638
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,759
you know like how efficient sometimes

639
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,199
literally you know the world can be i

640
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,038
mean it's so efficient guys that

641
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,720
literally we all use it you know we all

642
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,158
use the same form of energy which is

643
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,319
called atp

644
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,039
and what is happening

645
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,480
with atp is the bond eventually is being

646
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,000
broken up again

647
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,599
and when that happens that's when the

648
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,279
energy is released

649
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,119
to fulfill all the processes that

650
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,240
happens in both a human

651
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,439
as well as animals as well as implants

652
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,400
now

653
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,798
furthermore um phosphorus is also an

654
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,880
activator of enzymes and roots love it

655
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,839
as well roots grow really really well

656
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
under phosphorus

657
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,240
i mean multiple things like calcium as

658
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,599
well roots love calcium as well guys we

659
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,798
come to it later

660
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,279
one of the things that i just think is

661
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,079
funny chris when you look at fertilizers

662
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,200
is the over application of phosphorus

663
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,599
you know

664
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,159
people talk about the pk 1314 or they

665
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,959
talk about like a 5234 you know what i

666
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,720
mean

667
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,360
and it's like more phosphorus for like

668
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
flower development and by development

669
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,240
and

670
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
yes it is important don't get me wrong

671
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
100 this

672
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,840
but if you look at nature and if you

673
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,558
look at the resources

674
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,319
and i show people that they're like wow

675
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,440
i didn't think you know that that was

676
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,079
the case

677
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
and what i showed them is actually

678
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,639
plants don't need that much phosphorus

679
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,639
as people really think that they need

680
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,159
it's crazy you know a lot of people they

681
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
talk about nitrogen that you shouldn't

682
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,159
use any flour well first of all guys

683
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,919
i would say try it try using you know

684
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
a product that has no nitrogen during

685
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
flour and you will see yourself what

686
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,759
happens i understand why people want to

687
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
cut it down that's 100 sure but i hear

688
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,079
some people talk about don't use any

689
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,080
nitrogen at all i'm like okay i guess no

690
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,519
amino acid production i guess

691
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,599
chlorophyll production is going to be

692
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,839
down as well you know

693
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,599
good luck with that but yeah phosphorus

694
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,599
is all is often an over applied element

695
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,839
and like i said it's easy to bind with

696
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,959
heavy metals in the substrate

697
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,119
so most of what they apply chris

698
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
literally just resides in the soil in

699
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,479
the substrate itself

700
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,038
and there are a couple ways that you can

701
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,000
use to increase efficiency nutrient

702
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,440
uptake

703
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,839
um like umicrophobic acids microbes

704
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,600
um but still over application of

705
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,480
phosphorus is definitely a problem in

706
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:15,759
the world both indoors as well as with

707
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,200
big agriculture

708
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,119
interesting if we go back to history

709
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
actually is that it was already

710
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,399
discovered in

711
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,960
the 1600s

712
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,120
and again i don't know why it has always

713
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
been by german it's crazy how often

714
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,439
we're going to see the germans involved

715
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,440
in agriculture

716
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,038
it's crazy but uh it was actually

717
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,879
already discovered chris in 1669

718
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,240
actually and funny enough you just

719
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,360
mentioned urea it has to deal with urine

720
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,919
so literally what happened is when you

721
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,798
actually distilled urine

722
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,799
a white salt was being left behind and

723
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,119
that was the first phosphorus to be

724
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,038
honest it was very flammable gloat in

725
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,639
the dark so whenever you see something

726
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,640
glow in the dark right like a bowling

727
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,840
alley or whatever they also use some

728
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,520
form of phosphorus in there

729
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,359
and funny thing enough i don't know do

730
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,200
you know where the name comes from chris

731
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,319
no it actually means like

732
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,480
miraculous bear bearer of light huh

733
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,079
interesting i didn't know that another

734
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,519
question for you

735
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,960
and obviously i did my research before

736
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,798
guys know that i know everything right

737
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,038
before but

738
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,960
so it's uh it's not a diamond

739
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,158
know-it-all or anything like that guys

740
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
but uh

741
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,559
funny enough do you know how many

742
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:35,199
gallons actually of urine it took to

743
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:38,879
create like 60 grams of phosphorus no

744
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,120
how many gallons 290 gallons to produce

745
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,600
60 grams of phosphorus

746
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,918
that's crazy that's a lot

747
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,240
of e-collection out there

748
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,640
so i mean obviously that wasn't a

749
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,480
source that we could use to use in any

750
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,320
type of

751
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,640
application actually

752
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,399
and funny enough

753
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
after that the

754
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,640
largest source up until

755
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,120
end of the 19th century was actually the

756
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,320
the bones and also guano you know bones

757
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,759
of animals

758
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,200
um yeah

759
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,679
and because there's a lot of like

760
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,440
phosphate found inside bones and also

761
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,759
with guano you know there's a good

762
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,000
amount of phosphates found as well

763
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,960
um yeah so funny enough the whole world

764
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
turned actually towards um the bones

765
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,200
because calcium phosphates were found in

766
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,640
there and then um

767
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
actually like i said you also know in

768
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,679
guano itself but then at one point

769
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,839
because more and more

770
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,600
synthetic fertilizers were actually used

771
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,839
and demanded for especially towards the

772
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,319
end of the 19th century that they needed

773
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,079
to find a different source because

774
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,158
literally at one point everything was

775
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,359
already basically used and it just

776
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
couldn't keep up with the demand

777
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,918
and

778
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,839
one of the reasons why synthetic

779
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,000
fertilizers were so popular at the end

780
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,678
of the 19th century had to do with

781
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,278
justice from liebeck

782
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,679
and i think you talked about it chris

783
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,839
before in a different episode

784
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,360
with one of your um

785
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,959
you know other people actually but for

786
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,759
those of you that didn't see that

787
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,679
specific episode so justice von leybig

788
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,200
is basically a german scientist again

789
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,679
always in german

790
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,519
that discovered those 17 elements that

791
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,640
the plant need to grow and develop

792
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,119
themselves so the mpks the calcium the

793
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
sulfur the magnesium et cetera

794
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,599
and

795
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,200
interestingly interestingly that

796
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:32,000
happened around 1850 1860

797
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,679
so after that that's really because you

798
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
finally discovered hey this is what we

799
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,159
need to do to actually grow

800
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
really good crops and in a consistent

801
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,960
way that's when the whole synthetic

802
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
industry basically came to life and then

803
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,679
what happened because like i said at one

804
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:49,278
point

805
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,600
the demand actually over uh exceeded the

806
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,839
supply and that's when i turned to

807
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,359
phosphate rocks

808
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,678
and i don't know if you you heard about

809
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,240
that chris oh very common yeah rock

810
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,480
phosphate is used very commonly it's

811
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,240
it's a number one source there isn't

812
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
uh well i shouldn't say there isn't i

813
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,159
know there are some really big companies

814
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,000
working on a different source of

815
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
phosphorus it's still an experimental

816
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,798
phase

817
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,319
and the reason why is because they

818
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,398
literally think that with the demand

819
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,678
that we currently have that the world is

820
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,918
going to run out of the phosphorus in

821
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,679
like 40 to 50 years

822
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,360
which is going to be a problem

823
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,559
especially if at that time we're

824
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,558
probably going to be with 9 to 10

825
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,319
billion people

826
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,398
you know we all need to be fat we are

827
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,839
all hungry multiple times a day and

828
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,278
phosphorus is honestly crucial in that

829
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,599
supply

830
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,798
but yeah rock phosphates indeed

831
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,558
is where

832
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,480
the majority of the phosphorus comes

833
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,240
from and basically what happens with

834
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
those rock phosphates i don't know if

835
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,359
you know what an electric arc is chris

836
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,278
no i don't so it's basically like a

837
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,359
like i see this like a big furnace and

838
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,960
it's also like how to make steel and

839
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,719
steel is also being made by extreme heat

840
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,679
and an electric arc you can see it is

841
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,759
like you got like three of these

842
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,559
pins so you got like three of these pins

843
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,038
right

844
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,200
and they all actually um like

845
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,720
electricity electricity goes through it

846
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
and they basically connect with each

847
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,798
other through electricity

848
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,159
and because by doing so

849
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:20,398
an extreme heat is basically produced

850
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,039
and when phosphate rocks actually are

851
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,839
being put in there and they're actually

852
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,480
mixed with in this case a product it's

853
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,759
called coke c-o-k-e it's not the coke

854
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,000
that comes from colombia in this case

855
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,000
guys but it's a natural product

856
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,079
it actually mixes with each other and

857
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,960
then element of phosphorus is actually

858
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,759
created an element of phosphorus is like

859
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,000
a pure form of phosphorus that can be

860
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,158
actually further amended

861
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,919
and in this case what they do actually

862
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,360
is

863
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,480
they distill it and then actually they

864
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,000
burn it with air to produce phosphorus

865
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,240
pentoxide

866
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,440
and then the phosphorus pentoxide in

867
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,079
this case is being dissolved in water

868
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,278
and that creates phosphoric acid

869
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,879
and phosphoric acid is another um

870
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,319
frequently used form in fertilizers it

871
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,519
is also used we actually we use

872
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,278
phosphoric acid in our ph minus bloom

873
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
version because we got two different

874
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:17,679
bloom versions you know all about it

875
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
because you've got the bottles of

876
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,038
honeycrisp

877
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,359
oh yeah yeah phosphoric acid very

878
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,278
commonly used in ph down products and

879
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,359
often says that it kills off microbes

880
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,839
which uh is a myth you know people think

881
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,319
that they're adjusting the ph

882
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,599
you know using ph up or ph down and

883
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,678
that's wiping out the whole mythical

884
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,639
population which is is false it's one of

885
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,480
the common myths that you hear true

886
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,000
and it's it's crazy to hear how many

887
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,599
myths there are and also like how many

888
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,759
myths are spread by some really big

889
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,158
companies in the industry and often what

890
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,278
kills like the microbes is literally the

891
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,039
ph

892
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:54,079
you know when it's too low basically

893
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,398
everything below ph4 guys

894
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,960
then is when most bacteria can grow they

895
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,798
can't grow in that environment but when

896
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,720
you use phosphoric acid on its own you

897
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,359
mix it with water and everything the ph

898
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,519
will never get below ph4 so just like

899
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,439
you said it doesn't kill

900
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,839
anything at all

901
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,000
that's also one of the reasons why

902
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,720
fertilizers liquid fertilizers often

903
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,119
have a pretty low ph on its own

904
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,038
it also has to do actually with the

905
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,038
longevity of the product you know to

906
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,480
keep it in good condition because one of

907
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,640
the last things that we want when you

908
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,558
sell your fertilizers is the bacteria

909
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,880
can grow inside a bottle

910
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,240
um and literally the bottle with

911
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,120
nutrients creates you know is like a

912
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,200
bottle of like a positive portion polish

913
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,359
now poison that you know plants want to

914
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,798
use to grow big and heavy and you know

915
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,639
what i mean

916
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,558
so um

917
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,159
yeah if you just look at places for

918
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,038
example like channel build life wants to

919
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,480
grow every single where so what like i

920
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,398
said one of the things we have to do as

921
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,079
far as liquid fertilizers

922
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,319
uh you know like manufacturers we need

923
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,000
to keep the ph low to keep the microps

924
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,200
out initially

925
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
um

926
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,640
yeah that's like a little bit of a side

927
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,759
note what we use

928
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
because that is also like one of the

929
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,599
questions i think you want to know chris

930
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,919
like what does detroit use

931
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,480
we use a mixture actually so we use like

932
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,799
indeed phosphoric acid

933
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,919
we also use something called

934
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,759
monopotassium of our mono potassium

935
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,278
phosphorus

936
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,440
as well

937
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,880
yeah it honestly has to do with like

938
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000
creating the right mixtures the right

939
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,159
ratios

940
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,798
for some of the products we personally

941
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,039
only use the minimum of a food grade

942
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,879
product we always first look at like the

943
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:38,640
heavy metal analysis of

944
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,720
you know the supplies that we get in

945
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,038
because we only want to ensure that what

946
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,200
we sell to you guys it's also like the

947
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,398
highest quality that we can offer and

948
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,360
still offer the best price quality ratio

949
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:54,239
because that is also important obviously

950
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,398
so that's personally what we use gotcha

951
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,399
lots of information about these elements

952
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,558
more than i expected

953
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,359
sorry man like i said i

954
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,200
yeah i'm just excited about it it's okay

955
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,558
it's great great information for sure

956
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
let's move on though let's go into

957
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,320
potassium so similar to the other

958
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,440
elements you know how is it beneficial

959
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,000
to the plant how is it sourced and then

960
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,918
kind of what form does dutch pro use and

961
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,398
are there any forms that we should avoid

962
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,239
yeah no definitely that's a

963
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,159
couple good questions though

964
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,559
one thing one side note why i'm so

965
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
excited about it chris i was in la a

966
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,559
couple weeks ago and i was actually with

967
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,158
a friend of mine who grows and he we got

968
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,159
in the store and obviously there's so

969
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,559
many brands to choose from he's like

970
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,159
rico he's like to be honest he's like i

971
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,159
don't understand nutrients he's like i

972
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,039
look at the bottle i look at the back i

973
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,960
see all those you know sources he's like

974
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,559
i don't understand what does it do what

975
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,320
does it mean how is it actually being

976
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,559
sourced and then i have to think about

977
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,399
this podcast obviously and i was like

978
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,440
okay i really wanna you know make sure

979
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,319
that

980
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,838
i tell like the full picture full story

981
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,320
that definitely double triggered me

982
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,440
but yeah potassium so potassium is

983
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,280
crucial in both veg as well as flour and

984
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
it is actually the only element that is

985
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,599
not part of an organelle

986
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,240
and basically what it does is it is

987
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,680
crucial for nutrients transportation

988
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:19,439
and it is also crucial for um

989
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,118
the regulation of co2 through the

990
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,159
stomata through the leaves

991
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,680
and there's something called like a

992
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,358
potassium pump

993
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,118
and i'm not gonna go too deep into it

994
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,039
right now because it's about sourcing

995
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,200
but basically what you have to realize

996
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,838
and understand about potassium is it

997
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,960
literally regulates the inflow and

998
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:40,400
outflow of elements from cell a to b

999
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,280
or at least plays a crucial part of it

1000
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,519
potassium also activates enzymes

1001
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,839
and like i said enzymes are used also

1002
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,559
for nutrient transportation but also to

1003
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,838
speed up a variety of processes inside a

1004
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,078
plant

1005
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:58,719
uh yeah and like some potassium is just

1006
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,519
crucial both during veg as well as flour

1007
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,439
the name i think is very interesting

1008
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,599
potassium which is obviously a lighter

1009
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,480
name but it's also frequently called

1010
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
potash so basically with potash how it

1011
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,519
really started is just

1012
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,599
by burning wood you know and and the ash

1013
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,400
literally that was being left behind

1014
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,160
um places in a pot and potassium is very

1015
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,880
water soluble i think it's one of the

1016
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,920
most water soluble elements actually in

1017
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
this world

1018
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
and

1019
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
basically by mixing it with water and

1020
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
then filtering it

1021
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,279
you get like the potassium was being

1022
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,599
left behind

1023
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,640
and initially actually it wasn't even

1024
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,640
used as a fertilizer funny enough

1025
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,239
it was eventually used as a fertilizer

1026
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,000
because they had so much of it and they

1027
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,759
had no clue what to do with it and it

1028
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
was like you know what let's just

1029
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,000
use it as a fertilizer and see what

1030
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,839
happens as an experiment

1031
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,838
but up in that point it was actually

1032
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,279
used for soap production

1033
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,960
mainly yeah potassium was actually used

1034
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
as like a soap so basically what they

1035
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,000
would do to make um soap back in the

1036
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,519
days was use like fat from like a pig or

1037
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,519
whatever

1038
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,838
and then actually mix it with water and

1039
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,280
then potassium and if you mix it up

1040
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,119
that's literally how they created the

1041
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
the first soaps

1042
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,160
and funny enough

1043
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,560
um

1044
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,199
a lot of the trees and forests that were

1045
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,880
cut down in europe back in the days

1046
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:25,439
was actually to create potassium

1047
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,599
and something very cool i think is the

1048
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
first u.s patent

1049
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,680
like

1050
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
in history

1051
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,519
was actually because of potassium as

1052
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,799
well it was actually an improvement of

1053
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,679
how to filter potassium to offer a more

1054
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,160
cleaner source of potassium first patent

1055
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,838
ever in the us history was about

1056
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,519
potassium

1057
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,880
and then we go actually back to the 18th

1058
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,719
century and it was signed by george

1059
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
washington himself so i thought it was

1060
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,039
pretty cool as well

1061
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,358
uh but yeah a lot of like trees were cut

1062
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,358
down actually because of it and it was

1063
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,759
literally like one of the uh

1064
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,039
biggest sources up until like the 19th

1065
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,880
century

1066
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,239
and the 19th century actually like i

1067
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
said so many trees were cut down like

1068
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,479
the forests were cut down in europe then

1069
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,760
forests were cut down in the u.s

1070
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,760
as well

1071
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,040
because of potassium production

1072
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,400
and then

1073
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,079
what happened then is they found

1074
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,358
protection really deep

1075
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,280
into the ground and it was literally an

1076
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,759
average they would find it like over 4

1077
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,560
000 feet deep which is obviously crazy

1078
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,640
deep and it also brought a lot of risks

1079
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,159
with them to actually mine

1080
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,639
the potassium so accidents would happen

1081
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,519
it wasn't uncommon you know that like

1082
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,679
gas and oil was actually sitting pretty

1083
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,838
close at that

1084
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,199
depth as well so some accidents happen

1085
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,880
with that

1086
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,960
but eventually what i did and i thought

1087
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,960
it's so simple chris and it is so smart

1088
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,119
and still works so well that it's still

1089
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,838
being used up till today

1090
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,838
they use the water solubility in the

1091
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,639
their advantage

1092
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,039
so if you guys google there's an amazing

1093
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,679
video out there on youtube it's about

1094
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,079
potassium mining in utah

1095
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,960
like two hours southeast from salt lake

1096
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,200
city

1097
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
and literally what they do

1098
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,719
is they drill a hole to the source of

1099
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,519
potassium

1100
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,199
they

1101
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,358
pour water in there

1102
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,159
they literally you know give potassium

1103
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,078
time to dissolve in water they just pump

1104
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,519
it out at the other side through a

1105
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,480
different hole

1106
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,480
then they literally create these lakes

1107
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,559
which they treat with

1108
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,519
a mixture of copper sulfate to actually

1109
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,279
keep the bacteria and fungi away

1110
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,320
and they literally just wait they let it

1111
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
evape

1112
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,000
they literally let the water evape out

1113
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,000
of those lakes and what is being left

1114
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,960
behind is just a thick layer of

1115
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,400
potassium and that is literally how most

1116
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,280
of the potassium nowadays is still

1117
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
sourced

1118
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
it's an efficient way

1119
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,880
um

1120
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,200
and yeah it's so easy actually wow

1121
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,079
that's super fascinating yeah

1122
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,519
honestly chris uh it's a very um

1123
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,119
interesting video as well to watch for

1124
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,719
all for everyone in your audience

1125
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,480
because you see those lakes and those

1126
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,239
lakes actually they change the color of

1127
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,960
the water changes color because of the

1128
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,879
copper sulfates and because of the uh

1129
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
different evaporation stages that they

1130
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,559
are in and then

1131
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,318
the potassium you know after the

1132
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,318
potassium is sourced

1133
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,880
it is easy to bind and most of the

1134
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,599
binding when it comes to fertilizers

1135
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,838
it is being done through a mixture of

1136
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,838
pressure

1137
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,679
heat

1138
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,760
and a catalyzer you know like an iron

1139
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,759
iron for example or another metal

1140
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,599
that is literally the the basic would

1141
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
you which you need to understand of how

1142
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
elements are attached to each other like

1143
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
a potassium sulfate

1144
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,719
or you know like when you look at the

1145
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,119
back of a bottle you see potassium

1146
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,598
sulfate or you see

1147
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,480
mono-potassium phosphate for example

1148
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,720
or g calcium nitrates and like i said

1149
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,559
those elements i mean they need to be

1150
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,679
binded together through some form of

1151
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,318
process

1152
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:07,199
and that often goes through heat

1153
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:09,599
pressure and catalyzation as well

1154
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,759
now we use a mixture so we use for

1155
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,480
example potassium sulfate we use mono

1156
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,160
potassium phosphates

1157
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,440
yeah we use a couple of varieties of

1158
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,118
potassium

1159
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,358
as well is there any forms that we

1160
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,358
should avoid good one good one um

1161
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,519
are a couple forms that you should avoid

1162
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,239
well

1163
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,679
yes and no i would say and it all has to

1164
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,959
do again with the filtration part

1165
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,118
there's something that you can't see

1166
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,358
from a label unfortunately

1167
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,440
and it's also a little bit the strong

1168
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,920
point obviously of the brands you know

1169
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,240
like the raw materials that they use the

1170
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,400
quality of the raw materials but it all

1171
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,879
has to do with filtration processes you

1172
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,400
know how clean is the raw material that

1173
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,880
you use

1174
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
and what you guys can totally do

1175
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,000
and you can definitely do with us you

1176
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,160
can literally ask for the heavy metal

1177
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,639
analysis if you guys want if you want to

1178
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,399
see how clean our nutrients are go over

1179
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,960
it you know send me a text

1180
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,440
go to that's for you say instagram or us

1181
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,519
you know go to our website contact us

1182
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,960
um actually we also already have it out

1183
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,639
on the website as well so you guys can

1184
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,800
just look it up

1185
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,318
you know i think we should as nutrients

1186
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,400
manufacturers and brains we should be

1187
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,719
open and transparent the words the

1188
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,639
people about what's inside the products

1189
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,000
you know what i mean absolutely i

1190
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,039
completely agree with you on that one

1191
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,519
for sure

1192
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,639
let's move on to sulfur sulfur is one of

1193
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,239
the ones where

1194
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,318
i feel like not many people talk about

1195
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,679
it but it's super important i mean it's

1196
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,759
right up there with the importance of

1197
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,919
npk a lot of people can

1198
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,960
would uh would say so talk to us about

1199
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,960
sulfur

1200
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
how is it beneficial for the plant how

1201
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,800
is it sourced what form does dutch pro

1202
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,039
use so on and so forth

1203
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
yeah exactly well sulfur is actually a

1204
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,440
funny funny one in a variety of ways

1205
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,680
well first of all it's an important

1206
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,920
actually element because it's one of the

1207
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,118
building blocks for two crucial amino

1208
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,200
acids which is meteor 9 and sea stein

1209
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,039
and they are both crucial actually for

1210
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,759
the transportation

1211
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,279
of electrons which are then actually

1212
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,960
used to create the energy molecules

1213
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,480
and basically without sulfur honestly

1214
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,480
you would know that straight away with

1215
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,639
deficiencies when your leaves turn

1216
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,880
basically white yellow white but you

1217
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,799
would definitely see that your growth is

1218
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,800
stagnated in your overall

1219
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,200
flower development as well

1220
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,200
now funny enough

1221
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,358
and i never realized it actually up

1222
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,919
until i did like some deeper research

1223
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,279
but do you remember like those videos

1224
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,880
you basically saw them like back in the

1225
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,599
days where you saw people like wearing

1226
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,480
like

1227
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,400
cotton cloths and you saw like these all

1228
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,838
these gases around them

1229
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,358
and it gets like yellow it's like

1230
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:44,880
basically like a yellow mine there were

1231
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,039
but there was on the outside these are

1232
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,200
all gases

1233
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,199
like the old silver sulfur mines

1234
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,399
actually and it's super poisonous super

1235
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,399
poisonous

1236
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,480
and you still sometimes actually see it

1237
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,639
you know in like very poor countries

1238
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,960
because sulfur definitely brings in some

1239
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:04,400
money but it's so poisonous so if you

1240
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
look up like you know solver mines uh

1241
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,680
poor countries or underdeveloped

1242
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,680
countries you know give it a term you

1243
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,879
would definitely find them and there was

1244
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,078
also like

1245
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,920
had back in the days would source it

1246
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,318
but it was not a sustainable way it was

1247
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,400
not actually a way that would work

1248
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,559
long-term lives because of the health of

1249
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,800
people

1250
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,358
so basically how they then did it

1251
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,880
was they used a different process it's

1252
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,679
called the fresh

1253
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,039
process actually

1254
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,960
which is what they would do again they

1255
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,679
would use the solvability of the

1256
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,599
solubility of sulfur itself

1257
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,838
so they would find solver mines they

1258
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,240
would actually put hot water in there

1259
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,480
hot enough so the sulfur would actually

1260
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,358
melt and mix in the water

1261
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,119
and then once brought to the surface

1262
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:55,679
actually they would literally have like

1263
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,119
a 99.5 percent efficiency ratio so 99.5

1264
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,598
of the sulfur deep in the mines they

1265
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,838
would get out

1266
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,960
unfortunately this process was very

1267
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,279
costly to do so so they turned away to a

1268
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,358
different source and that source is

1269
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,280
still used up till today

1270
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,960
and honestly funny enough

1271
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,240
sulfur right now

1272
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,039
it is a

1273
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,118
byproduct from the petroleum industry

1274
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,920
yeah literally it's a by-product from

1275
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,358
the uh petroleum industry and it had a

1276
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,039
couple advantages

1277
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:26,559
you know first of all less risk was

1278
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,239
involved as far as like health concerns

1279
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,119
but it was also cheaper

1280
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,199
and basically what happens is

1281
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,358
the byproduct it's called hydrogen

1282
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,118
sulfide

1283
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,519
and hydrogen sulfide actually goes

1284
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,200
through a process called claus the

1285
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:42,880
clause process

1286
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,879
and this process actually is already

1287
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,838
like pretty old we go back to like late

1288
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,599
1800s

1289
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:51,279
and basically what what happened and

1290
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,039
it's just similar to the different

1291
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,640
processes it would go through like

1292
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,480
distillation

1293
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:00,159
so we go through multiple distillation

1294
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,159
processes where heat again was involved

1295
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,239
temperatures of like said heat was

1296
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,199
involved pressure was involved

1297
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,799
catalyzation was involved

1298
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,879
but when nitrogen needs like a

1299
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,240
temperature like 800 fahrenheit we talk

1300
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,800
about 1900 fahrenheit in this case wow

1301
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,239
pretty pretty warm so uh

1302
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,480
during wintertime guys whenever you're

1303
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,289
cold just stay close to a

1304
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,920
sulfur

1305
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,838
[Laughter]

1306
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,000
and and what i actually would get when

1307
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,799
they were treated with this this heat is

1308
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,480
they would get elemental sulfur

1309
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,119
and again elemental sulfur is a pure

1310
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,679
form that they could build on to

1311
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,000
eventually create sulfuric acid because

1312
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:43,199
that's by the way what we gonna end up

1313
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,519
we're gonna end up with sulfuric acid

1314
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,559
so with the elemental

1315
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,400
sulfur

1316
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,400
in this case

1317
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,039
it would go through a different process

1318
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,880
called the contact process

1319
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,440
and basically whatever we do

1320
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,358
is the sulfur is burned

1321
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,679
to sulfur dioxide

1322
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,759
and then sulfur dioxide

1323
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,440
is again being turned into sulfur

1324
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,160
trioxide

1325
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,880
and again heat is involved pressure is

1326
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,598
involved catalyzation is involved

1327
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,280
and then the silver trioxide eventually

1328
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,838
is being

1329
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,319
mixed with water or added with water to

1330
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,440
create sulphuric acid

1331
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:25,279
and this sulfuric acid actually

1332
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,920
is already a source of solver obviously

1333
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,839
on its own but you often fight solver as

1334
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,400
a combination of

1335
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,920
so for example you have copper sulfates

1336
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,720
you got

1337
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,440
like a potassium sulfate you know epsom

1338
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:42,480
salts is actually magnesium sulfate

1339
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,760
you know so sulfates is often a

1340
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,400
product that is

1341
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,359
combined and mixed already with another

1342
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,639
product

1343
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,440
so the sulfuric acid is crucial

1344
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,440
in

1345
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,200
different processes to bind with for

1346
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,318
example magnesium to bind with for

1347
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,318
example potassium

1348
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,760
yeah that is literally

1349
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,719
in this case all there is to sacrifice

1350
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,359
about sulfur

1351
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,118
we use in this case not sulfuric acid on

1352
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,799
its own on its own but we use

1353
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,760
combination products like i said

1354
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,359
potassium sulfate um

1355
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,400
like i said like a copper sulfate for

1356
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,519
example

1357
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,559
anything

1358
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,039
um

1359
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,480
in a combination with

1360
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,558
the epsom salts and everything as well

1361
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,800
and it all comes down to how clean is

1362
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,680
these nutrients and there's such a big

1363
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,000
variety there are so many

1364
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,239
if you think that the choice for picking

1365
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,519
your nutrients in the store is already

1366
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,118
big

1367
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,400
just wait till you go to the back hand

1368
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,559
of things

1369
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,680
the amount of

1370
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,079
you know raw materials that you can

1371
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:50,960
choose from is crazy it's so diverse

1372
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,160
and yeah it's difficult to to explain

1373
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,920
and to show people because it's

1374
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,920
obviously also you know like we don't

1375
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,838
want to make our competition

1376
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,639
smarter already than they are it's also

1377
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,400
our secret recipe of course but uh

1378
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,799
yeah you have to look at like how clean

1379
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,079
is it how well is it filtered and also

1380
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,000
like

1381
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,280
what is important to us at least is like

1382
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,599
the processes that were involved because

1383
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,440
definitely what you see is um

1384
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,559
a lot of like

1385
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,760
sources actually you know are come from

1386
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,119
low cost

1387
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,640
places as well and that's something that

1388
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,200
we don't deal with you know we don't

1389
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:27,118
want to deal with low-cost countries

1390
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,199
because they're often also like

1391
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,519
safe on quality measures they also often

1392
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,279
save on healthy measures you know or

1393
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,800
even like kids involved or anything like

1394
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,800
that and that's something that you we

1395
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,519
don't want to be associated with so we

1396
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,960
only actually do business with companies

1397
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,880
um

1398
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,960
that we actually align with as well if

1399
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,358
that makes sense yeah that definitely

1400
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,358
makes sense so we definitely covered not

1401
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,000
really much when the grand scheme of

1402
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,960
things we covered nitrogen phosphorus

1403
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,880
potassium we did sulfur i wanted to get

1404
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
more done but there's just there's so

1405
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,559
much we're definitely gonna have to do a

1406
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,639
part two that is for sure one thing i

1407
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,559
did want to comment on is that i really

1408
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,920
like and it's real

1409
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,440
apparent that

1410
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,440
you guys are focused on the science

1411
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,280
behind things now i learned quite a bit

1412
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,960
in this episode but there are some

1413
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,720
things i'm currently attending utah

1414
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,000
state university there's a horticultural

1415
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,399
certification i'm going through right

1416
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,800
now by dr bruce bugbee he's well known

1417
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,318
in the the community here and one of the

1418
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,359
things that you're saying in this

1419
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,199
episode he's saying so i know that

1420
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,440
you're going by the science when it

1421
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,279
comes to these elements

1422
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,480
you know sourcing avoiding some of the

1423
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,079
things that you should avoid because

1424
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,079
it's bad for the environment and so on

1425
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,000
and so forth like i said we definitely

1426
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,440
have to do a part two that is for sure

1427
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,400
you know next episode i think silicon

1428
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,119
calcium magnesium boron copper iron we

1429
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,039
can go on and on and even chlorine is

1430
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,039
something that's worth talking about but

1431
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,800
let's do a part two here with the next

1432
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,639
couple months i think this is one that

1433
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
people are going to want to hear about

1434
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,000
wrapping things up on this episode you

1435
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
know how can the listeners find you and

1436
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,039
what do you have upcoming in the future

1437
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,639
yeah so there are a couple of ways

1438
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,599
actually to find us i mean you can go to

1439
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,838
our website that'sprousa.com

1440
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,920
a lot of information videos out there

1441
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,000
they can go to our instagram i'm

1442
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,519
personally pretty active out there just

1443
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,838
that's for usa

1444
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,079
um unfortunately we go in and out of a

1445
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,599
shadow band you know at the moment so we

1446
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,039
probably have to put in desperate usa

1447
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,960
completely in order to find us at the

1448
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,920
moment uh we are starting our own

1449
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,920
youtube channel pretty soon as well

1450
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,000
actually uh we have a pretty cool idea

1451
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,200
as far as podcast so hopefully we can

1452
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,039
actually do it the other way around too

1453
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,039
chris and have you in our show

1454
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,480
um you know i think it could be pretty

1455
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,318
cool yeah as far as like for the future

1456
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,240
a lot of cool things we have some really

1457
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,358
interesting uh things as far as product

1458
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:47,039
development

1459
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,639
we are gonna focus heavily on um

1460
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,039
spreading and sharing knowledge you know

1461
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,719
with you guys as much as we can because

1462
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,199
we literally want to help out as many

1463
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,919
growers as we can become better growers

1464
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,318
and i learn every single day

1465
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,000
from amazing people and i would love to

1466
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,519
help other people as well and i know the

1467
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,838
whole team is motivated to help other

1468

00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:14,400
lot to discuss maybe for next time it's

1473
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,280
going to be like a harry potter series

1474
