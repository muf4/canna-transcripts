1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
question taking the defoliation leaves

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,519
and mixing them in with your soil that's

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,718
cooking I do your thoughts I do too I've

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,240
done it before and had some good results

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,959
now you're going to get people who are

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,638
going to be against it hot composting

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,880
right you're you're adding organic

8
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:21,358
matter into the soil that could heat up

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,679
hurt Roots potentially I still do it and

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,640
I haven't had any issues that I visible

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
issues that I can see so I definitely do

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,278
it you know it'll break down and become

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,879
usable nutrients for the plant I'm a

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,000
proponent of that also proponent of

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,079
doing the chop and drop as defoliation

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,558
just dropping it right down in the

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
medium having that as your mulch layer

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,759
help retain moisture in the medium so

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,799
yeah I'm a proponent of that although

20
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,839
there are some people who are oppos it

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,839
any good Black Friday deals on grow

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,719
lights yes there's definitely a lot of

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,559
good deals out there but one that comes

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
to mind right away is from today's

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,599
sponsor Mars Hydro if you're a beginner

26

Growers check out their fce series and

29
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,759
they say for the Masters out there take

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,920
a look at their FC or FC Evo series they

00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,959
have budget friendly lights dimmable un

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,040
know ppfd some have Smart functions and

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,520

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,159
different times during that time frame

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,960
so keep an eye out their website is

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
mars-hydro

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,240
docomo have you been continuously using

42
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,319
the same soil have you run into excess

43
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,319
and to test the soil I've been running

44
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,639
the same batch of soil now for five

45
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,959
grows if I remember correctly I have not

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,200
actually gone and done a soil test it's

47
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,959
genuinely recommended to do a soil test

48
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,759
between grow Cycles some people do a

49
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,280
soil test when we're going from Veg to

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,599
flour as well but getting a soil test

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,718
can be costly it adds up especially if

52
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,239
you are getting Consulting to have

53
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,839
somebody interpret the results for you

54
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,199
and give you advice on what you need to

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
mend in so I've just been taking the

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,560
Gamble and just doing uh just a mending

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,758
on top of it and so I have not actually

58
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,159
run into any excess issues due to over

59
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,159
fertilization I've just kind of stuck

60
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,000
with the 30-day rule where you know

61
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,159
you're basically amending every 30 days

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,439
and I use the fertilizer Blends this

63
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,759
round and last round I use kiss Organics

64
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,719
nutrient pack one cup per plant 10

65
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,840
gallon container for this I was using

66
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,840
craft blend same deal one cup per plant

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
and every 30 days and of course that

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,640
initial amending that comes in there too

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
so but now long story short I have not

70
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,199
run into any excess issues probably

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,200
should send it out for a to solo test

72
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,119
just to see what it looks like you know

73
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,679
just for out of curiosity purposes but

74
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
I've just been taking the Gamble and

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
like uh hoping for the best you know

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,439
which I think a lot of people is what

77
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,119
they do do you have any favorites when

78
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,158
it comes to synthetic nutrients yeah

79
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,680
Blue Planet nutrients Blue Max two-part

80
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,759
cow mag I love running just that I'm

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,200
running that right now that plus the

82
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,158
stash blend so this is just the additive

83
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,878
the only additive I'm really running now

84
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,798
when I'm using synthetics yeah that's

85
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,598
pretty much my favorite really is Blue

86
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,920
Planet nutrients I actually used a

87
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,759
three-part in all their additives to

88
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,839
with good success so is scrogging

89
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,598
outdoor a crazy idea and would you

90
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,799
recommend blue mat or something else for

91
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,798
watering indoor scaring outdoor is not a

92
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,799
crazy idea I've seen so many pictures of

93
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,200
amazing scrog results Outdoors so no

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,400
it's not a crazy idea I think a common

95
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,878
thing that people do instead of scrog is

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,319
they will uh just utilize a TR stn for

97
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,239
support keeping things up not so much

98
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,679
trying to create an even canopy like you

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,280
do indoors with scrogging and also I

100
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,799
think a lot of people they'll use the

101
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,878
net but they also do like just a I think

102
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,599
it's a 45 degree angle bend on that

103
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,598
initial stem and that's it as far as

104
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,438
training of course lollipop and stuff

105
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,280
like that but so that those are a couple

106
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,878
different approaches there blue mats I

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,759
recommend for indoors that's what I run

108
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,359
I love the blue mats they're so

109
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,078
hands-off I mean I do grow was where i'

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,400
come back a week later and plants are

111
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,040
fine you know just water only the

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,120
organic amendments in there already

113
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,000
amended in there and uh go on vacation

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,560
come home everything's great some people

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,319
have had blue mats fail on them I did

116
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,720
have a fail on it trying to remember

117
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,159
exactly what the heck happened like one

118
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,040
plant failed it didn't like flood my

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
house like some people have reported it

120
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,879
happened to them just cuz and it could

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,160
be user error right if you're not

122
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,600
adjusting the dial on there it could

123
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,080
certainly fail right if you're not doing

124
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
it if you're not setting it up properly

125
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,680
but if you follow the instructions set

126
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,439
it up properly two notches back just

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,478
like they say in the instructions you

128
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,680
should be good I had one what the heck

129
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,758
happened like one dried out out of

130
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,879
nowhere I don't know if there was like

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,120
maybe a kink in the line or something

132
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,120
you know not the main line but the the

133
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,439
carrot line that branches off maybe

134
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,918
there's a kink in there or something but

135
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,478
one plan kind of dried out so I had to

136
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,799
like reset that whole carrot so I have

137
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,599
had them fail before but uh as long as

138
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
you're monitoring things and checking on

139
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
it daily you know every couple days days

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
you can correct issues like that since

141
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:08,079
you had the EVO 3 what's your opinion

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,478
now so AC Infinity EVO 3 LED grow light

143
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,399
I love it bar style light is for a 2T X

144
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,879
4ot grow space I'm still running into

145
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,239
this day I've been running it ever since

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,680
it came out earlier this year and I love

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,079
the fact that you can connect it to the

148
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,918
app so I have control over it on the AC

149
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,918
Infinity app so I can you know control

150
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,120
the light schedule control the dimming

151
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,000
amount that it's set at so on and so

152
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,840
forth and um yeah seeing some good

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,439
results Great growth I have a par meter

154
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,879
so I'm able to kind of dial in the light

155
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,519
distance I'm able to you know again

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,719
adjust the dimmer down if needed and

157
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,240
bring it closer or increase the light

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,520
distance and ramp it up whatever power I

159
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,079
want to get so there's some flexibility

160
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,959
there with with the dimmer and such but

161
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,879
I love it no complaints have you ever

162
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,198
had to recalibrate one of your blue ma

163
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,038
carrots midcycle if Cell mind sharing

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,680
how you went about getting it going

165
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,360
correctly yeah so this is pretty much

166
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,720
just what I answered I check on them

167
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,560
almost every day just to for that ease

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
of mind I'm going in there and just

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,598
looking to make sure that things still

170
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,240
functioning correctly certainly there's

171
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,399
times where the initial install the next

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
day I'll go in there and I'll see like

173
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:17,318
it's dripping pretty fast and I'm just

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
like hm might need to be adjusted right

175
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,720
it doesn't seem like it should be

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,478
dripping down that fast while some of

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,680
the other plants seems to be dripping at

178
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,959
a normal rate so then I'll go in there

179
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,160
and make the adjustments right and once

180
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,399
you use the blue mats long enough you

181
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,840
can kind of feel exactly where you need

182
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,799
to stop it's around that Two Notch back

183
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,198
as they say on the instruction some

184
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,800
people do a notch and a half back but uh

185
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,598
yeah absolutely I always I think pretty

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,439
frequently I go in there and kind of

187
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:48,159
tinkering around with it specifically

188
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,160
the day after install I'm going in there

189
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,280
and checking and some of them I might

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
have to recalibrate slightly how do you

191
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,758
reset the blue ma carrot after went dry

192
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,400
pinch the tubes take it out and

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,598
completely refill and reset yeah so you

194
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,758
you can you can pinch it and then that

195
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,918
way you can take it out refill and reset

196
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,038
what I did actually is I had another

197
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,159
carrot that I already had soaking so I

198
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,000
was able to do the swap pretty quickly

199
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,919
there so yes pinch it swap take the old

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
one out put the new one in and then

201
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,519
connect so I don't know if you have an

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,000
extra carrot or not I got the 12 pack so

203
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,799
I do have some extras kind of lying

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,519
around most of the time at least unless

205
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,360
I have 12 plants growing my stash PL

206
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,918
came in today any any suggestions on how

207
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,759
to use it I'm growing in soil soil frch

208
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,839
I personally recommend half teaspoon to

209
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,639
1 teaspoon per gallon of water basically

210
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,399
mix it into water and then water your

211
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,680
plants with it it's that easy that's the

212
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,719
most efficient way to use it I know some

213
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,199
people are sprinkling on their Roots

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,039
during transplant that's not really

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,199
recommended by the scientist who helped

216
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:56,639
develop it some people are using it in

217
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,520
dwc at a I believe it's a fourth dosage

218
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,519
and uh they're seeing some good results

219
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,478
there but yeah just plain and simple mix

220
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,799
it up in water make sure it's mixed in

221
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,719
real well and then water your plants

222
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,319
with it I have two electric guys they're

223
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,440
out of business now what do you think

224
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,759
about them I have to keep them turned

225
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,158
down or my plants don't like them I

226
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,639
always had really good success running

227
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,680
the electric guys I had the v1s the V2s

228
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,960
and the v3s I thought it was a great

229
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,639
company excellent customer service

230
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,519
quality product many people are still

231
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,079
running the electric size right now with

232
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,439
great results I think the original V1

233
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,918
was what released in 2017 if I remember

234
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,120
correctly and uh here we are what 6

235
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,838
years later and they're still working

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,158

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
information there have you started

262
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,199
teaching a little one about Organics yet

263
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,200
maybe some light reading of your new

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
book before

265
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,040

267
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,480

00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:47,399
ago now October 5th is when her birthday

269
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
is and um so I'm still in the barely

270
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,559
getting any sleep stage apparently that

271
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,799
lasts for what the first year or

272
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,239
something like that don't get don't get

273
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,838
much sleep because you got a little one

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
there but uh no I haven't started

teaching her about Organics yet she can

276
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,600
barely hold up her head

277
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,759
so uh but I should start to read her

278
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,159
some information about that on a nightly

279
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,600
basis right then maybe by uh you know

280
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,278
two three four years old she'll start

281
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,278
