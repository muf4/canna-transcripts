92
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,759
didn't believe it a lot of people didn't

93
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,598
believe that you were the reason that I

94
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,959

appreciate you hooking me up man I

97
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,039
wasn't expecting that at all yeah me

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,560
neither I didn't think they were going

99
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
to be given that way all that stuff I

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,840
think people had lights not even in

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,719
boxes and stuff like so yeah it was

102
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,039
insane it was awesome really really good

103
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,560
event though but yeah I'm glad you

104
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,239
decided to come on to the podcast today

105
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,199
we're going to be talking about growing

106
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,039
a couple different ways here growing

107
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,878
Organics and synthetics you grow both

108
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,719
ways I think it's really important to

109
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,318
know some of the differences between the

110
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,079
two I know me personally when I first

111
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,119
started I was growing with synthetic

112
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,000
inputs and then I switched over to

113
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,360
Organics and I was trying to do the same

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
things that I was doing with synthetics

115
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,200
and there are some things that are

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
different so going through today and

117
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,560
finding out kind of how you do things

118
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,079
growing both ways and I think there's

119
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,799
could to be a lot of tick ways for folks

120
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,480
that are listening in that they'll be

121
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,200
able to apply in their own garden so

122
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,759
really excited for this conversation but

123
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,159
before we get too deep into it can you

124
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,399
uh give us an introduction tell us a

125
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,600
little bit about yourself and how you

126
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,758
got into gardening well I'm M grahs and

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,280
I started ging about a almost a year and

128
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,319
a half ago now and it was really because

129
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
I just wanted to grow my own you know

130
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,319
you don't really know what's going on

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,800
out here you don't know what everybody's

132
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,319
putting into their into their stuff and

133
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm starting to get real weary on what's

134
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,560
out there so I really wanted to take

135
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,000
full control of what's going into my

136
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,079
garden what's going into my body awesome

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
and then what is your style of growing

138
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,719
are you an indoor grower outdoor I know

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,079
you said you grow both with Organic

140
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
inputs as well as synthetic inputs what

141
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,758
medium are you in as well yeah right now

142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,319
I've only been able to have the chance

143
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,520
to grow indoor and I'm growing both like

144
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,639
you said organic and synthetic so for my

145
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,680
organic gr I'm using Builder soil 3.0

146
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,478
and I try to run their whole line all

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,120
build of soil the whole build of soil

148
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,279
family and for my synthetic grow I

149
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,918
haven't stuck to one Coco yet but I've

150
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,758
been switching around from different

151
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,038
Coco companies okay got it so a little

152
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
bit of both soil and cocoa you got

153
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,918
experience do them both so some people

154
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,399
might be listening into this and they

155
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,879
might be not knowing fully what the

156
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,439
difference is between organic and

157
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,279
synthetic can you break it down for us

158
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:38,000
well with Organics the way I grow I try

159
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,239
to get everything set like before I even

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,439
plant my first seed you know I need to

161
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
have all my nutrients everything that's

162
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:48,879
going to be taken up within the grow

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,800
already set whereas in synthetic it's an

164
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,279
inert media the cocoa that I use there's

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,240
nothing in there and I'm adding my

166
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,038
nutrients as I go every day I'm feeding

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
nutrients every day got it and we'll

168
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,639
break down your feeding regimen here in

169
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,759
a few minutes yeah there are quite a few

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,598
differences between organic and

171
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,240
synthetic I think uh organic a lot of

172
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:10,159
people think of all natural things that

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,720
come from the earth for example

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,599
sustainability is something that can be

175
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,800
mentioned when it comes to organic some

176
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,800
of the differences in techniques we're

177
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,199
going to get into that now as far as

178
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,400
watering medium container size that you

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,439
can use and so on and so forth let's

180
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,799
jump into medium first when you're

181
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,759
growing organically what medium do you

182
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,478
use I think you mentioned soil right and

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,759
then what's in that mix to begin well

184
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,800
it's already a pre-made mix from Builder

185
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,160
soil so they come out with a pretty good

186
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,680
bag 3.0 and it's everything already

187
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,919
prepared so you're ready to go to flow

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,879
once you're ready to go to maybe a few

189
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,198
weeks before you'll add your your stuff

190
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,560
that you're going to need so I'm adding

191
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,639
craft blend I'm adding Kashi I'm adding

192
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,680
Thrive okay yeah I've pulled up the 3.0

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,639
recipe here it's got so much stuff in

194
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,360
here too much to name on

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,639
everything fish compost we've got

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,598
biodynamic compost worm castings trace

197
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,240
minerals hum make the list goes on so

198
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,000
it's a very long list of things that uh

199
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,000
that included in this recipe I've heard

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,519
a lot of people having really good

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
success with build of soil soils I think

202
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,598
they have a handful of them but I think

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
their most popular one is that 3.0

204
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,719
recipe that you mentioned yeah ever

205
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,318
since I started using it i' I've been

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,080
sticking with it I haven't had a problem

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,680
with them I could stick a cut a fresh

208
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,878
cut the directly in there and it'll grow

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,959
no problem and with Organic another

210
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,560
thing that is worth mentioning is you're

211
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,318
really relying on the micro life in

212
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,959
order to break down those amendments not

213
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,280
all the amendments in there I mean some

214
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,279
can be soluble right so when you water

215
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,079
it in it turns into a bioavailable form

216
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,559
that the plant can then uptake but for

217
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,439
the most part A lot of these are going

218
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,120
to need that after the watering the

219
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,038
microbes go to work then and they break

220
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,478
down those nutrients and make put them

221
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,519
into a form that's going to be available

222
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,439
for the plant to uptake so that's a big

223
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,519
difference there that uh we didn't

224
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,680
mention before now when you're growing

225
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,038
with the synthetic bottle nutrients are

226
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,519
you just in Cocoa you mentioned that and

227
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,360
kind what 7030 cocoa perite mix okay and

228
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,758
there's no amendments that you add in

229
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,038
prior to planting you're just using the

230
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,639
bottle nutrients is that correct yeah no

231
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,079
I actually got a salt nutrients so it's

232
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,400
no bottle yeah it's all dried nutrients

233
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,279
powdered form got it no and then what

234
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,679
container size are you using when

235
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,598
growing organic When I grow my Organics

236
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,360
I go anywhere from 5 to 7 I wouldn't

237
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,278
mind growing a little bit bigger but

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,120
right now that's all I'm able to grow

239
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,399
in as far as my synthetic grow when I

240
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,240
grow my synthetics it doesn't really

241
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,679
matter I've seen I could grow in a one

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,440
gallon pot or in a five gallon pot and I

243
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,599
can still get the same results depending

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,360
on how much I'm feeding I hear you yeah

245
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,040
on the organic side of things you often

246
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
hear people say the bigger the better

247
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,559
you know what I mean but you can't

248
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,559
certainly get away with say smaller grow

249
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,399
pots and I know what's small is

250
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,838
certainly subjective but I think a lot

251
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,720
of folks would consider 3 gallons 5

252
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,200
gallons as being smaller containers even

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,360
maybe some people might say seven

254
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,079
gallons or 10 gallons are small they

255
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,440
prefer 15 gallons or more I personally

256
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,958
ran Organics in I've tried three gallons

257
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,720
I've tried five gallons seven gallons

258
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,319
I'm up to 10 gallons and actually gotten

259
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,278
easier and easier as I moved up in pot

260
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,440
size and that's one of the biggest

261
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,439
argument for folks that are growing

262
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,079
organically is they say the the bigger

263
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,160
the pot size the better now certainly

264
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,679
there are downsides to

265
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,078
running a bigger pot size but having

266
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,799
kind of a bigger pot size and having

267
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,078
more nutrition in there it just can be a

268
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,639
lot easier kind of retaining moisture

269
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,159
and so on and so forth now with the

270
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,519
synthetic I agree with you like right

271
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,719
now I've got two gallon grow pots that

272
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,519
I'm growing with the synthetic nutrients

273
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
so on the smaller side of things and

274
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,200
I've also run that with three gallons 5

275
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,838
gallons seven gallons so I've tried out

276
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,240
a variety of things as well and I really

277
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,959
do like growing in those smaller ones

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,759
particularly two gall

279
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,479
now if you're hand watering it might be

280
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,159
there might be an advantage there to

281
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,600
being one of the larger pot Siz you have

282
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,919
to water as often yeah but if you're on

283
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,440
an auto watering system like I'm on the

284
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,120
blue mat system with two gallon

285
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,640
containers it's it's fantastic yeah

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
those blue mat systems are amazing I

287
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,240
actually need to give me one I'm still

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,600
hand watering myself so yeah I got a

289
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,360
couple self-watering bases but I need

290
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,399
more yeah it can be so much easier to

291
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,800
just dump water into a reservoir for

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,720
example and then have your organic

293
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,599
inputs in there and it's just slowly

294
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,680
dripping down as needed under the medium

295
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,040
it's certainly beneficial so for

296
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,799
feedings I want to get deep into this

297
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,719
one because this is I think is where a

298
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,559
lot of people get tripped up for

299
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Organics you had mentioned that you're

300
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,000
using the build Sol 3.0 recipe so it's

301
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,319
not really going to need any additional

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
nutrition to begin right no not to begin

303
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,120
with depending on what's pot size you're

304
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,680
using how big of a plant you're growing

305
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
how long you veg for you could

306
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,319
potentially run out of that nutrition

307
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,000
rate that could be completed from The

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,639
Medium so is that the case for you and

309
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,039
if so what organic inputs are you

310
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,959
providing the plant with as far as in

311
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,399
veg I haven't had a problem like in my

312
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,439
plant will go through the whole veg

313
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,000
cycle fine it's when you're flipping

314
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,120
into flour now a lot of people see the

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,919
organic they see the bags and they hear

316
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,519
water only and it'll get you so far

317
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,799
water only but it's not going to get you

318
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,600
the quality that you want if you're only

319
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,199
using water so before I go into flour

320
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,959
I'm adding the craft blend and I'm

321
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,720
adding a builda flour and that's going

322
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,119
to help me get all the nutrients that I

323
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,600
need later on cuz in organic it's going

324
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,039
to take a lot for everything to break

325
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,200
down so you want to prepare your soil

326
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,319
before you get into flow okay so you top

327
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,839
dressing before flipping the flower how

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
long are you usually doing a veg for uh

329
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,600
it depends I've done one month vegges

330
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,278
I've done two month vegges I notice with

331
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,079
the 2 month wedge I'll get a bigger

332
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,078
yield at the end so 30 to 60 days and

333
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,039
then uh before flipping a flower you'll

334
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,759
top dress and do you just do that one

335
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,278
top dressing before FL flower or you

336
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,319
also doing a top dressing kind of

337
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,360
midflower uh sometimes mid flow too I'll

338
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,920
add some

339
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,919
stash I'll hit it up and yep okay yeah I

340
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,120
know roughly people do every 30 days but

341
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,919
really depends on again you know what

342
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,799
what size container you're in how big

343
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,240
the plants are so on and so forth yeah I

344
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,399
feel like in the those five gallon pots

345
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,000
just at one time in the beginning before

346
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,559
I flp a flower it's it's enough yeah the

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,559
plan's been doing good I haven't had no

348
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,879
deficiencies towards the end and I'm

349
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,319
happy with what I'm getting awesome so

350
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,278
it's just craft blend and then build a

351
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,879
flower are there any other inputs you

352
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,360
use on the organic side of things

353
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,519
whether it be worm castings or any

354
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,879
additives or anything yeah there's uh

355
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:53,240
wor castings in the in the craft BL Leaf

356
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:56,639
but I'm also using a Bashi and there's

357
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,240
another bottle it's a th that's also

358
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,720
comes with from the build Sol family

359
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,759
believe that's uh Yahweh I'm mistaken

360
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,199
drive botle and that's being applied at

361
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,519
the same time as yeah the Bild of flower

362
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,919
okay so yeah pretty easy regiment there

363
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,759
when it comes to Organics a lot of

364
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,319
people uh I think that's one thing that

365
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,639
a lot of people like is you're just

366
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,160
really doing a few two maybe three

367
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,159
sometimes maybe even more top dressings

368
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,319
and then it's just water only from there

369
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,439
so that definitely makes things a lot

370
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,360
easier when it comes to feeding now on

371
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,639
the synthetic bottle nutrient side that

372
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,560
powdered line that you're talking about

373
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,440
what is the name of the line that you

374
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:38,000
use I use strive nutrients uh pretty

375
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,720
simple line it's a two part system and

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,159
the a&amp; B from Veg to flour it's the same

377
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,879
ratio so you don't really have to wor

378
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,719
about calculations or anything like that

379
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,320
yeah real simple line that sounds pretty

380
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,720
easy are you doing a full dose according

381
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,639
to their feeding chart are you doing

382
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,560
like a half dose and how often are you

383
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,560
doing feedings so I'm filling up a 5

384
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,599
gallon res resir and that probably lasts

385
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:06,278
me about 3 to 4 days and I got about

386
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,879
four plants growing off of that right

387
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,799
now okay and then are you just you're

388
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,639
just scooping it out with a container

389
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,519
and then Watering your plants as needed

390
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,399
yeah yeah well I got a water hose now

391
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,519
and it's a lot easier so I could just

392
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,600
water my plants is within two minutes

393
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,679
you know everything's done and yeah it's

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
real easy that's cool now are you doing

395
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,239
uh I think you mentioned in the

396
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,399
beginning you're feeding every single

397
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,278
time so anytime the medium dries out

398
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,360
you're giving dose of nutrients have you

399
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,039
ever done the every other feeding where

400
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,440
you're watering one time then you're

401
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,799
feeding the next time then when the

402
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
medium dries out you're watering again

403
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,319
and going back and forth I know it's a

404
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,599
very common technique when it comes to

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,759
using synthetic nutrients have you done

406
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,079
that before or is it just straight

407
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,560
nutrient mix every single time yeah when

408
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,078
my synthetic I haven't done that I've

409
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,198
just been giving the nutrients every

410
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,319
time now have you run into any toxicity

411
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,319
issues at all no no I haven't had no

412
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
problems sounds like a really easy

413
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,600
lineup to use yeah I like it ever since

414
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,599
I started using it I don't think I'm

415
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,519
going to switch over I mean I like using

416
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,199
other lines too like trying different

417
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,320
stuff but I'm really set with that one I

418
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,000
really like it you have to adjust the pH

419
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,800
at all that's a common thing that people

420
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,679
look at when using synthetic nutrients

421
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,519
is they mix it up in their nutrient

422
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,239
solution and then they'll adjust to the

423
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,000
pH what does your pH come out to before

424
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,360
and and then what do you adjust it to

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,958
before I adjust it it's usually around

426
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:38,240
68 7 and I try to get that down to 6 58

427
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:42,679
6 around there 5.8 or 6.0 what do you

428
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,839
use to adjust down uh just the G General

429
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,559
Hydroponics pH Down got it I believe

430
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,440
that's a phosphoric acid but I'm not

431
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,599
100% sure but yeah those acids are very

432
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,759
commonly used in order to adjust the PH

433
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,600
down now with the Organics are you phing

434
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,519
at all like are you monitoring the pH

435
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,440
whether it be not at all that's thing

436
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,959
about it yeah I mean I know I can but

437
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,600
the plant's been showing me that she's

438
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:12,039
doing good and she's she's fine she's

439
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,720
happy so I don't think I need to change

440
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,559
anything on that side right now that's

441
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,600
another way that it makes things easier

442
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,000
as you don't have to adjust the pH at

443
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,839
least in your particular case I'm not

444
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,318
sure you know we'll talk about water

445
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,480
here in a minute but your initial water

446
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,120
source is certainly going to tell you

447
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,278
whether or not you need to do that pH

448
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,318
adjustment some people comes out of

449
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,879
their tap at 8 pH or higher and like I

450
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:36,759
have to adjust the pH or else I come

451
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:39,198
across problems but if your tap water or

452
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,318
your filter Oro whatever water source

453
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,198
you're using if it falls within that you

454
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,399
know six to seven range roughly

455
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,278
sometimes it can be up to 7.5 pH people

456
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,919
swear that they add that in and they

457
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,559
don't do any sort of pH adjustments and

458
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,759
their plants are fine yeah when when I

459
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,559
check mine out the top it's at seven but

460
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,839
I still like I let uh I let my

461
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,159
reservoirs air overnight I'll stick a

462
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,639
AirStone in the in the water let that

463
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,838
sit for at least 24 hours before I give

464
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,759
it to any of my PLS yeah it's also said

465
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:09,480
to help eliminate some of that chlorine

466
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,038
that's in there all that extra stuff

467
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,038
that you don't want to give yeah yeah

468
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,798
depending on your local water source it

469
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,078
uses either chlorine or chloramine

470
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,160
although if chloramine is included

471
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,720
that's one thing that people really have

472
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,640
to be aware of is that isn't something

473
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,798
that is just going to if you have it sit

474
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,799
overnight it disappears it's more of a

475
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,079
stable molecule versus the chlorine a

476
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,279
lot of people just let it sit overnight

477
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,000
some people let it sit and have an

478
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,000
AirStone in there like you do some

479
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,480
people put it in light they said that

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,119
helps with it dissipating well my first

481
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,679
6 months when I started growing I was

482
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,599
buying water so I was just buying

483
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,960
distill water every day and that was

484
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,879
getting expensive after a while man so I

485
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,880
started testing with my tab water and

486
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,840
the plants didn't really give me too

487
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,720
much of a reaction to everything normal

488
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:00,240
the same so I just stuck with

489
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,360
that man I can only imagine yeah I had a

490
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
buddy who lived locally he was buying

491
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,839
water every time he was buying reverse

492
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
osmosis and it adds up I personally

493
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,918
think over time it's going to be worth

494
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,279
it to buy a system that you can actually

495
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,840
install like underneath your kitchen

496
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,720
sink for example because they're pretty

497
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,319
small and uh a lot of these are now a

498
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,558
one:1 ratio before a lot of the old

499
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,279
systems are a 1 to three so what do I

500
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,759
mean by that it's basically for every

501
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,359
one gallon of RO water that you get out

502
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,640
of the the system there three gallons

503
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,119
would be wasted yeah now like I

504
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,400
mentioned it's a one to one so for every

505
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:37,399
one gallon you get only one gallon is

506
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,480
wasted and so um yeah buying that which

507
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,720
is uh 200 250 bucks roughly for that

508
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,519
particular system I'm talking about the

509
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
one: one system it can certainly save

510
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,359
you money over the long run versus going

511
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,079
and buying either reverse osmosis or

512
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,678
distilled it could be very very costly

513
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,319
doing that Avenue yeah I'm definitely

514
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,400
looking into getting something different

515
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,158
and picking up a system for the house so

516
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't have to worry about the lot

517
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:04,360
anymore now how about the EC or PPM

518
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,120
let's start with Organics are you doing

519
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:11,399
any type of monitering of the EC or PPM

520
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,199
not on not on either one of them really

521
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,679
like the only thing I monitor is the pH

522
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,558
on my synthetic

523
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:23,519
side and that's about it like it's hard

524
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:26,079
for me to check the PPM or PM and like I

525
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,200
just try to focus on one number and

526
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,240
stick to that a lot of people play the

527
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,200
numbers game and they chase it and

528
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,839
they're just driving themselves crazy

529
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,679
but like until I see my something going

530
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,759
on with my plants where I feel like I'm

531
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,640
doing something wrong or I'm lacking in

532
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,440
something then I'll start paying a

533
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,120
little bit more attention to that yeah I

534
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,360
think a lot of people on the same take

535
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,158
the same route that you do when it comes

536
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,279
the organic side of things in particular

537
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,440
where they are mostly hands-off when it

538
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,558
comes to both pH like we mentioned as

539
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,159
well as the EC and the PPM yeah but

540
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,119
they're coming across problems some

541
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,760
people do check that both the ph and EC

542
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,199
or PPM in order to see hey is there a

543
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,960
lack of nutrition or is there too much

544
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
maybe there's too much nutrition in

545
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,159
there has caused a toxicity issue

546
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,840
checking on an as needed basis seems to

547
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,679
be the theme for a lot of folks growing

548
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,558
with Organic inputs now you had

549
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,120
mentioned with that with synthetic those

550
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,000
that synthetic line using the powdered

551
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,558
line you're not checking the EC or PPM

552
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,079
of that which I think a lot of people

553
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:26,678
might say that's a little surprising

554
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,439
there not to monitor it have you come

555
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,759
across any issues like with toxicities

556
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,320
in particular or any

557
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,480
deficiencies no not yet no ever since I

558
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,480
started using this line I swear I

559
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
haven't had no problems that's awesome

560
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm gonna have to check out that line

561
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,839
maybe even try it in the future it

562
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,558
sounds like a real easy line to use

563
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,599
especially if you're you're using it

564
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,639
you're not having to check EC or the PPM

565
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,759
because that's a common thing lot of

566
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,559
people do though to make sure that the

567
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,119
nutrient solution going into it is the

568
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,558
range they're looking for or they'll

569
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,879
check the runoff measure measurement so

570
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,158
they'll run the nutrient solution

571
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,559
through and then they'll check the the

572
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,840
runoff and make sure that the ECR PPM is

573
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,558
kind of within certain ranges so you're

574
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,038
not aiming for particular ranges for the

575
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,359
different stages of growth when you're

576
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,879
going with the synthetic inputs no no

577
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,240
not I'm just monitoring the pH levels

578
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,840
and that's it interesting I really

579
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,440
recommend that line for anybody who's

580
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,798
new and thinking about getting into

581
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,240
synthetics it's been real good for me

582
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,038
like being a new grower I haven't had no

583
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,440
problems and yeah yeah I really like it

584
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,839
awesome that's good to hear so you

585
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,759
already mentioned using tap water now

586
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,240
how do you go about the waterings of

587
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,200
your plant are you kind of checking the

588
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,278
medium and seeing if it's dry or are you

589
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
kind of on a schedule maybe we'll start

590
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:46,319
with Organics how do you go about

591
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,400
watering when you're using the organic

592
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,720
inputs well I used to have it on a soft

593
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,880
watering base it would just drink as I

594
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,240
wanted to and I would let that dry out

595
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,159
maybe once a week and then I would top

596
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,319
dress the water in

597
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,880
like the everything that I top dressed

598
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,639
to feed into the roof system the self

599
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,919
watering base will hold about maybe

600
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
three days of water two or three days of

601
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,038
water and when I check the level on it I

602
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,319
notice it's getting dry I start checking

603
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,278
the weight of the actual pot itself so

604
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,759
I'll pick up the actual pot see how

605
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,038
heavy it's getting or how light it's

606
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,759
getting that's the that's been the

607
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,359
easiest way for me to check and when

608
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:28,079
growing Organics you have only been

609
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,359
using the self-watering is that correct

610
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,918
yeah yeah now how about when you're

611
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,240
growing with the synthetic inputs are

612
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,038
you still doing a self-watering or you

613
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,960
top watering or what I'm top watering

614
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,119
yeah every day I'm top watering in since

615
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,558
you're in Cocoa more of an area medium

616
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,798
doesn't hold on to the moisture as much

617
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,240
you're doing every single day you're

618
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,918
going in there and doing a watering huh

619
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,519
yeah I wanted to use a softw watering

620
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,480
basis but I've heard people have

621
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,879
problems when they're feeding synthetics

622
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,880
ble feeding so I don't want to run into

623
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,520
problems I don't really want to

624
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,159
experience them either so I'm just going

625
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,000
to keep keep doing has been working for

626
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,760
me for right now so I'm just tap

627
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,400
watering every day it's not broke don't

628
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,558
fix it right yeah yeah exactly exactly I

629
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,559
mean you call it's always fun to

630
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,359
experiment but just as long as you're

631
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,319
just experimenting maybe on something

632
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,959
small not your actual Garden you know

633
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,038
yeah so pretty straightforward there how

634
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,079
you go about your waterings I want to

635
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:24,038
get into pests next let's start with IPM

636
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,119
things you could do to prevent pests

637
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,200
what do you do in that case I've had

638
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,158
problems with Pest and I had a bad bag

639
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,038
of in the past that I had to deal with

640
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,360
fungus

641
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,960
NS and to get rid of that I had to use a

642
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:40,439
mosquito bits so something that I had a

643
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,960
water into into the into the Coco every

644
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,360
day for at least about a week till I got

645
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,200
rid of that but I normally keep uh

646
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,798
sticky traps around now so that's always

647
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,640
a good monitor like just to keep an eye

648
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,519
on things it's not going to stop you

649
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,320
from getting them but it's going to tell

650
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,480
you if you have a problem or not [ __ ]

651
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:02,960
STS are such a pain man I battle them so

652
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,798
much they seem to come and go so often

653
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,278
it can be certainly be frustrating when

654
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,240
you have a a crazy outbreak it doesn't

655
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
sound like they have been too crazy for

656
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,079
you though have you come across any

657
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,278
major pest infestations whether it be

658
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,119
spider mice thrips anything like that at

659
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,558
all no just the fungus luckily that's

660
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,558
all I had I guess you know they say

661
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,558
you're not a real grow so you get spider

662
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:27,158
Ms and stuff I guess I'm not a real girl

663
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,200
yet I'm still learning yeah I've never

664
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,440
heard that before

665
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,919
yeah I heard somebody say that at the

666
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,399
girl shop the other day okay I guess I'm

667
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,200
not a real girl yet I don't know what

668
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:38,719
I'm doing I guess I guess agree to

669
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,399
disagree on that one I know people who

670
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,600
have been growing for five plus years

671
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:43,959
and they've never come across pests so

672
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,879
that's great going to call them not a

673
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,079
grower exactly right like come on man

674
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,440
that's funny I'm glad to hear that you

675
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,558
haven't come across any major

676
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,919
infestations it could be such a pain man

677
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,440
I had uh I had aphids Outdoors one time

678
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,480
and it was so disheartening it was on

679
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,159
actually my bok choy and I went in there

680
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,759
it was Harvest day and I was like ah

681
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,360
going to harvest some bok choy my first

682
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,359
time growing it I was super excited it

683
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,240
was purple Lady B choice so was like

684
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,839
completely purple and I went to go

685
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,480
Harvest it and I'm just just loaded with

686
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,519
aphid it's kind of like borrowed in and

687
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,919
it was just H it was disgusting I was

688
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,519
like oh no how the heck am I gonna eat

689
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,159
this stuff you know so well that's one

690
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,119
of the things about growing outside

691
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,080
right is like you can't really control

692
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,479
too too much what's going on out there

693
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:32,319
Outdoors is a whole different

694
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,880
Battlefield now are you doing anything

695
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,480
as a preventative like sprays a lot of

696
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,760
people use sprays particularly like in

697
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,519
the veg stage in order to kind of deter

698
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:45,200
pest or prevent pests from coming in do

699
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:49,319
you do those at all or no no I haven't

700
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,798
had to yet so I mean I know everybody

701
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,359
everybody's telling me to go ahead and

702
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,319
just get some preventive maintenance

703
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,000
going on before it happens but I haven't

704
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,000
had the chance to experiment with any

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,519
different type of sprays yet

706
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,759
but I'm always willing to try something

707
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,879
all right pretty straightforward there

708
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,158
I'll keep my fingers crossed that you

709
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,200
don't come across any

710
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,760
infestation we'll hope for the best on

711
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,120
that Avenue yeah now what climate are

712
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:17,240
you in um the the temperature range that

713
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,639
I try to keep is anywhere from 75 to 80s

714
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,319
maybe about 60 60% humidity level maybe

715
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
a little bit higher in the beginning but

716
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,439
towards the end I'm dropping it down and

717
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,880
that's probably the lowest I'll get is

718
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,440
about 60% around 60% for the whole grow

719
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,000
is that correct no I start off like in

720
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,919
my best Stage I'm aiming for a higher

721
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,679
humidity level I'm probably around 70 to

722
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:43,440
75 so as I'm going flipping into my next

723
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,320
stage is when I'll start lowering it and

724
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,480
probably towards the end the flow I'm

725
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:52,319
probably down to about 60% are you

726
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,759
supplementing CO2 at all or no uh no no

727
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,759
no no I want to get some type of system

728
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,558
going but I haven't had a chance to

729
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,240
experiment that yet no I noticed when I

730
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,798
had my my garden in my bedroom when it

731
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,880
was still small my garden was still

732
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,599
small my plants were grown a lot faster

733
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,840
and I believe it was because of the CO2

734
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,959
that I was able to provide for them now

735
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,398
that it's in a separate room yeah I see

736
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,240
the difference yeah oh yeah that makes

737
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,678
total sense I know some people who work

738
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,159
out in their grow room in order to

739
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,120
release that CO2 that helps their plants

740
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,399
I thought that was pretty funny yeah so

741
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,079
that's temperature humidity and CO2

742
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,239
let's talk about some mistakes that

743
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,599
Growers make starting with Organics are

744
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,079
there any mistakes that you made or

745
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,038
mistakes that you know of that people

746
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:44,240
make when growing organically yeah my

747
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:47,398
first organic grow I I read the bag and

748
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
except the water only so I just watered

749
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:53,479
only the whole way through all the way

750
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,080
to flour and I quickly realize that that

751
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,880
wasn't the way I mean there's only so

752
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,678
much that why is going to get you but in

753
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
flow you're going to need to add all the

754
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,320
extra stuff that you need you're going

755
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,960
to need all your nutrients I think a lot

756
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,519
of people run into that problem because

757
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,919
they see that on the bag water only and

758
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,640
they think they're good for the entire

759
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,679
grow and then they come across problems

760
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,840
and then they give up on Organics

761
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
because they uh they're not happy with

762
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,398
the result they thought it was water

763
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,519
only and all of a sudden they think it's

764
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,000
something else that they're doing in the

765
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,038
grow but yeah I think a lot of people

766
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,640
fall into that same trap now how about

767
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,200
when growing with synthetic nutrients is

768
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,159
there any mistakes that you can think of

769
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,159
that uh that maybe you've come across um

770
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,278
the only Mi I have so far was my pH pen

771
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,559
so I didn't have the proper pH pen and

772
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,679
it wasn't getting right so when I

773
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,480
started feeding my nutrients I wasn't

774
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,798
getting the grow I was expecting to see

775
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,159
and when I finally got a new p and I

776
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,960
seen that my old pH was way off and I

777
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,600
was able to adjust everything and get

778
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,120
everything correct right away I I

779
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,639
noticed the difference like the very

780
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:54,000
next two days the pants were taking off

781
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,919
yeah that's happened to me before as

782
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,558
well man those probes on the pH pen I

783
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,840
wish they lasted a lot longer now you

784
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,798
can use storage solution which is is

785
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,759
recommended right because if you're not

786
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,480
uh keeping that probe in storage

787
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,879
solution at all times really when you're

788
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,759
not using the pen it can dry out and it

789
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,480
dries out so quickly and then you come

790
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,319
across inaccuracies and you have to

791
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,759
actually buy a new probe and some of

792
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,200
these meters they don't have replaceable

793
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,119
probe so you have to buy a whole new

794
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,159
meter so I learned my lesson a long time

795
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,359
ago about keeping it in storage solution

796
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,240
and uh thankfully it lasts a lot longer

797
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,038
but yeah you still need to calibrate too

798
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,839
I mean uh I typically calibrate there's

799
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,158
some really good meters that I've got

800
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:37,398
away with not calibrating several months

801
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,039
and without calibrating and they've been

802
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:41,959
still accurate but I think General

803
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,839
recommendation is every month or so to

804
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,558
calibrate and actually that's a question

805
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,278
I'd like to pass off to the audience the

806
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,558
folks that are listening in for the

807
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,200
folks that use a pH pen how often do you

808
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,158
calibrate let me know down in the

809
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,360
comments section below but yeah pH pan

810
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,120
man that uh that is something that can

811
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,359
definitely be thrown off over time and

812
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,038
and you definitely need to keep your

813
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,439
eyes on that because that could cause

814
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,038
problems with your plants and I

815
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,880
recommend getting the going I mean

816
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,919
there's a lot of Cheaper versions that

817
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,519
are available but I wouldn't recommend

818
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:15,440
that you know which you you're going to

819
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,359
be using I got a AC Infinity one I

820
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,120
got yeah yeah I've got the all-in-one AC

821
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,240
Infinity one I've been using that for uh

822
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,879
since it came out so moving on one thing

823
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I want to ask you about I like to ask

824
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,240
this every now and then advice for

825
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,960
beginners for the folks that are just

826
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,278
getting started growing with Organic

827
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,120
inputs what advice do you have for them

828
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:37,839
uh if you're going to be listening

829
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,000
to other Growers and taking advice in

830
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,359
from other Growers try to stick with one

831
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,839
grower don't go from one grower and take

832
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,759
advice from another girl and another

833
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,119
girl or get tips from another girl cuz

834
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:51,278
it's going to mix everything up you know

835
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,319
try to find somebody that you could use

836
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:57,159
as a mentor maybe

837
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,558
and and stick with their with their girl

838
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,840
style

839
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,879
so you could develop your own I think

840
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,240
that's really good advice people do mix

841
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,960
things when they shouldn't mix

842
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,679
particularly like amendments will kind

843
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,079
of try to play soil scientist and like

844
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,120
oh I heard from this guy that this is

845
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:12,240
good to add in and oh this guy says that

846
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,678
this good to add in and all of a sudden

847
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,960
there's an imbalance of nutrition and

848
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,320
the medium and some elements are locking

849
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,159
out others you preventing uptake from

850
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,759
happening and uh they're coming across

851
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,360
problems so yeah I agree with you when

852
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,440
it's kind of like stick to somebody's

853
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,000
regiment that you're following maybe

854
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,240
just go with what they're going to begin

855
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,200
in until you've kind of seen some

856
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,440
success there then kind of experimenting

857
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,798
from there because when you're mixing

858
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,960
all these different things you can

859
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:40,599
certainly come across problems and uh

860
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,399
some could be hard to correct yeah with

861
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,038
Organics it's a it's a lot harder to

862
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,678
correct because it's going to take time

863
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,879
for the stuff to break down or you know

864
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,559
it's not going to be the whatever you do

865
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,240
is not going to be readily available so

866
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,158
you're not going to see if you corrected

867
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,000
it or not for another week maybe two

868
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:00,559
weeks sometimes yeah 100% do you have

869
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,359
any specific tips for growing

870
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,638
synthetically that you'd like to give to

871
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,678
beginners don't don't get stuck to one

872
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:09,719
line maybe don't be afraid to try new

873
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,278
lines you know there's a whole bunch of

874
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,600
different nutrient companies out there

875
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,440
there a lot of them are doing the same

876
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,319
thing just put different labels on there

877
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,080
so don't think just because one brand is

878
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,480
more popular or more expensive it's

879
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,240
going to be better know don't be afraid

880
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,798
to try new things but just always make

881
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,638
sure you got your pH levels right

882
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,119
another question I like to ask towards

883
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,638
the end of the episode can you list off

884
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,439
top three strains that you've grown and

885
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:36,519
kind of what you like about them uh one

886
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,240
of them was just recent it was a Chad

887
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:43,000
westports no joke it was a real real

888
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,440
easy girl she grew out nice and frosty

889
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,440
super Frosty she purped out real nice at

890
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,759
the end and when I harvested you know

891
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,840
she was real good she came out real good

892
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,038
real good uh real good effects and I've

893
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,038
only gotten about a year growing so it's

894
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:03,038
only so much that I got growing um one

895
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,158
of my other favorite ones that I had was

896

898
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:13,839
that was a real good one that taste bu

899
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:16,839
genetics okay yeah they B out of UK I

900
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:20,480

scent a fruit punch with a hit of gas

916
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,240
little bit of funk in the back end but

917
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,918
yep that's definitely one that I plan on

918
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,359
keeping around for a while man that

919
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,799
sound's right up my alley who's the

920
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,439
breeder on that I believe that was

921
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,638
exotic or Relentless one of the two I

922
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,240
had to double check and I'll get back

923
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,118
with that one okay sweet man well this

924
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,959
has been awesome dude we've went through

925
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,399
quite a few things when it comes to how

926
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,918
to grow organically and then how to grow

927
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,078
with synthetic place kind of really how

928
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,000
you do things in your garden and that's

929
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
really what this podcast is all about I

930
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,358
have people from all different

931
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,239
experience levels beginners intermediate

932
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,279
advance and they're really just talking

933
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,239
about either kind of area that they

934
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,280
specialize in or how they do things

935
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,118
within their grow so really happy that

particularly for the folks that are just

940
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,159
