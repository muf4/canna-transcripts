at MJ biscon 2023 and uh wow that was a

82
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,280
good time huh I liked how they broke it

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,480
up between like the um cultivation side

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,239
and then they had like a retail and

85
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,518
consumption side so it was a little bit

86
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,319

let's actually start off with uh thas a

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,238
little bit about yourself and kind of

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,959
how you got into gardening oh uh I'm

126
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,679
untrained astronaut nice to meet you

127
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,199
guys I go by Astro um I grew up around

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,959
the weed world uh my father has grown um

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,840
plants since I was a little boy and I

130
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,918
remember walking around on a dirt floor

131
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,560
and uh that was just you know some of

132
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,478
the earliest memories I have are him

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,918
growing plants down in the uh Cellar

134
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,879
underneath the house and it kind of it's

135
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,959
weird how it all went I didn't really

136
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,319
care much for uh plants at the time

137
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,079
being of that age obviously but as I got

138
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,439
older I just you know still didn't

139
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,560
really wasn't until I was in my like mid

140
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,639
20s that I really started getting in it

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,240
really heavy and uh from there I've you

142
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,759
know I've always seen my uh father

143
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,400
cultivate but I never truly learned I

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
just you know I was more so into the

145
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,038
sales side of things too in my mind like

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,439
I was you know at that time as a younger

147
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,279
kid I was trying to move things and

148
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,719
whatnot and uh it wasn't until later in

149
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,359
life when I had kids myself that I

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,280
discovered that I didn't want to go the

151
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,919
illegal route anymore that I just wanted

152
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,079
to pursue this this passion that I have

153
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,399
toward plants uh and go ahead and jump

154
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,879
into it so I dump my life savings into

155
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,359
my first grow room which was a uh 12x 12

156
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,800
and that ended up producing about 8 lbs

157
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,319
on my very first harvest and uh I I do

158
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,560
understand you guys aren't like uh going

159
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,280
for yields or anything and it's not

160
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,319
really that I'm going for yields it's

161
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,758
more so that I'm just trying to I'm

162
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,439
really trying to push these plants to

163
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,400
the limits to see where they go and so

164
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,240
that's kind of you know how the origin

165
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,638
became growing up around it and seeing

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,079
what I could do with the world when I

167
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,199
enter it so man that's awesome

168
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,318
underneath the house you were saying so

169
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,400
like that had to have been a crazy

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,560
ghetto setup huh it was it was that was

171
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,799
such a a crap neighborhood it was crazy

172
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,079
though I do remember playing with a

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,840
staple gun on the floor but I was so

174
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,159
young because we moved into the house

175
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,318
that we grew up in when it when I was

176
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,560
the age of five and so that had to have

177
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:23,080
been you know pre so prior to the age of

178
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,598
five so I don't know when you actually

179
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,800
are supposed to like recollect memory

180
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,800
but I guess that was prior to the age of

181
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,560
five you know what I mean so but then he

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,560
grew AK-47 in the uh the closets

183
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,800
downstairs I remember him growing Hydro

184
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,120
in the garage and you know he had those

185
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,598
Sleek little setups to where you

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
couldn't tell he had closets that were

187
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:44,519
blocked off so you go in the bathroom

188
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,319
downstairs and you're taking a dunk and

189
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,719
uh you look over and there was a closet

190
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,400
there but it's kind of like drywalled

191
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,240
over now and that's because you know

192
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,959
AK-47 was real popular at the time and

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,199
he had to have a way to do it and so

194
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,560
that was that was you know it's

195
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,680
something that I've always been very

196
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,839
very familiar with but it wasn't until

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,918
recent that I really got into learning

198
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,359
about it that's wild yeah back then you

199
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,680
had to be it very secretive right you

200
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,120
had to hide things you had to have these

201
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,519
areas that were closed off so it

202
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,560
couldn't really be identified that that

203
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,839
was what was happening so hold different

204
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,959
world now you can be a lot more open

205
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,679
with it which is which is fantastic so

206
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,680
so what's your grow style like what uh

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,959
you know what are you doing are you in

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,598
soil Coco Hydro you indoor outdoor like

209
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,638
what's your overall style I do indoor

210
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,079
organic and it's the build soil way I am

211
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,439
such a big fan Jeremy Silva was the

212
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,079
first YouTuber that I began watching and

213
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,439
that is like the smartest man on the

214
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,318
planet like between you guys I don't

215
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,519
know what the heck um you guys are both

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,280
brilliant with this stuff but I've

217
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,439
learned so much from him in particular

218
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,038
due to the fact like I was able like I

219
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,360
said earlier to produce 8 pound of my

220
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,158
first girl ever and that was I really

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
solely credit like Jeremy Silva like all

222
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:59,879
of his videos I religiously watch them

223
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
before going to bed I played it on the

224
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,039
TV and that's just you know how I did it

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,439
every night and so it was like the

226
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,158
moment when it went legal I just seen

227
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,439
this all happening I knew this was what

228
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,519
I was meant to do dumped my money in it

229
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,158
fell in love with it even more so than I

230
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,719
thought and then I did YouTube and so I

231
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,719
got these cameras now and I'm doing this

232
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm having so much fun with it like I

233
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,240
just I'm just trying to document my grow

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,918
and stuff and uh you know hopefully if

235
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,680
uh if I learn from something that maybe

236
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,478
I could share it with my audience and we

237
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,080
could all learn together because I think

238
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,639
a lot of my people know that I've only

239
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
been growing for 2 years and so I'm

240
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,278
still experimenting and learning myself

241
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,038
that's awesome yeah and I will have a

242
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,240
link to your YouTube channel down in the

243
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,439
YouTube description section below so if

244
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,000
anybody wants to uh follow him click on

245

247
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,440
I've tuned into a few of your videos man

248
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,360
you definitely got some good stuff so

249
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,080
definitely looking forward to see in the

250
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,360
future oh yeah the the MJ biscon you did

251
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,759
you did one on MJ biscon you did one on

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Cowboy cup dude I'm so excited

253
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,120
because uh yeah I've just been

254
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
practicing you know how it is with

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,639
editing you've done it it's just an

256
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,919
addiction very timec consuming that's

257
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,480
like another passion in its own I fell I

258
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
fell into another Rabbit Hole when I

259
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,519
fell into growing in YouTube you know

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,399
cuz then camera equipment and then

261
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,159
quality and then editing it's addicting

262
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,519
man all of this is so fun so let's get

263
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,679
into the build of soil way I want to

264
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,078
know more about this particular way of

265
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,239
going about it what's your soil mix and

266
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,958
then what fertilizer are you using my

267
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,120
are all reused they were 3.0 and then I

268
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:37,639
top dress I use um say I use build-a

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,519
flower that's the top dress I use and so

270
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,958
obviously build a soil 3.0 I do worm

271
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,078
castings from builda soil as well I use

272
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:49,639
uh about a cup of wake field biochar or

273
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:52,439
biochar and um Earth Juice High Brinks

274
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:56,360
molasses or high bricks molasses I use

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,519
for uh like um what is it microbes and

276
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,360
stuff I'm using like uh rootwise um

277
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,278
that's a um what is the word I'm looking

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,120
for biological Bloom support full

279
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,480
spectrum soil um inoculant that's the

280
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,959
word I was looking for inoculant um and

281
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,519
so that's what I'm using for my macrobes

282
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,199
and uh what else hope I don't miss any I

283
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,120
know recharge is in there for sure

284
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,079
recharge is amazing I also use Roots

285
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,039
Organics grow Bloom and Bloom booster um

286
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:32,879
rootwise obviously terrible packaging

287
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:34,838
but um what else I I wrote a list and I

288
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,200
put them up here just so I wouldn't

289
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,399
forget but oh build-a Bloom of course

290
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,240
build whm amazing one right there and

291
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,240
craft blend so the 3.0 build of soil mix

292
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,879
I'm familiar with that for my

293
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
understanding correct me from wrong that

294
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,919
won't last you throughout the grow it's

295
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,320
not like a true super soil to where you

296
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,479
just plant in it and then you're good to

297
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,480
go for the entire grow cycle but

298
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,159
eventually nutrients deplete from that

299
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,200
medium and then you need to add in more

300
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,078
inputs which you mentioned the inputs

301
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,360
that that you're using there so are you

302
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,719
first of all what size container are you

303
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,519
in and then when does your first top

304
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,399
dressing happen um I do top dressing

305
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,440
generally every two weeks or so um I

306
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,639
tried Las gr trying to go a little bit

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,240
further out to see what the results

308
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,240
would be if I let them go a little bit

309
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,519
more hungry for my own eyes to witness

310
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,039
I'm a Hands-On learner for sure and it's

311
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,480
not the results that you want that I've

312
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,078
learned in a larger bed of soil they do

313
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,759
go through it quite well so um I was I

314
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,519
am currently top dressing every two

315
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,278
weeks uh what I do is I do a compost te

316
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,879
one week and then I do a top dress the

317
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,639
next week on routine on a Wednesday and

318
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,759
so that way it just keeps them fed and

319
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,879
it keeps it so simple I use a compost

320
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,399
tumbler so it's kind of like you know

321
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,360
taking a tote and throw it in a washing

322
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,039
machine it just spins it around and you

323
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,240
don't necessarily have to do that I just

324
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,799
do it for the added effect of it's you

325
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,278
know mixed in pretty good and then I

326
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,159
just walk around with a cup like a red

327
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,879
Solo cup and just kind of equally

328
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,159
distribute it amongst the beds I have

329
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:04,559
two 90 gallon beds in my main 12x 12

330
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,559
room I've got uh 4 15 gallon bags in

331
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,679
there as well and that's all the build

332
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:13,239
of soil way and then in my basement grow

333
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,958
I have two 90 gallon beds I have two 15

334
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,600
gallon bags in there for the 10x10 and

335
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:23,359
then in my 5x5 I've got one 15 gallon

336
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,959
bag under um just a light and a charcoal

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,759
filter and actually no I'm sorry I was

338
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,719
actually bringing that up because I

339
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,679
wanted to see what I could do or test

340
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,240
myself but um I've got a 2x4 grow tent

341
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,799
it's a Gorilla Grow Tent and I've got a

342
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,039
15-gallon in there with a bathroom

343
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,679
exhaust system and just a light and

344
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,439
bottles of water just so I can learn

345
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,958
from the bare minimum like I want to be

346
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,959
able to grow plants with nothing and

347
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,319
then learn from that scratch all the way

348
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,439
to the top because I I started out

349
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
investing everything I had and I just

350
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,800
kind of I don't know I I felt like I was

351
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,199
missing the the proper foundation for

352
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:00,719
Learning and so my basement was my

353
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:02,479
chance to really grow the knowledge by

354
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,920
just bare minimum growing and really

355
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
hone the skill which I'm nowhere ever

356
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,399
near you know what I mean but I'm

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,360
definitely uh having fun with it so that

358
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,360
being said I do have a 4x4 with the 15

359
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,879
gallon in there as well and um that 2x4

360
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,639
and uh hlg sending me the Scorpion

361
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,799
Diablo X so I'm going to start another

362
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,120
one up so there's going to be another

363
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,159
4x4 with the 15 gallon in there just for

364
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,759
that one uh light so that's what I've

365
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,759
got going on now but uh quite a few it

366
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,639
feels like huh but I don't grow a lot

367
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,000
per bed I grow one to two plants even if

368
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,399
it is a 90 gon bed I just want to make

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
that one plant the happiest it could

370
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,000
ever be and as big as it can get and

371
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,000
then all I I'll lollipop them I've been

372
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,480
watching the northern scroger lately and

373
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,278
that was due to high again wrenching

374
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,360
them all the time and uh it was just

375
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,600
interesting to know that he goes in

376
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,879
there every day tucking like that and I

377
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
was just like wow you know what no more

378
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,000
weaving let's just go with the tucking

379
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,039
and I've had fa fantastic results I've

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,120
had so much fun with it here soon I'll

381
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,198
be putting out some footage of uh the

382
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,839
grow room and the uh work that I've been

383
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,439
putting in in there man that's awesome

384
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
yeah a bunch of different grow spaces

385
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,199
you got there and different beds and

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
containers and so all of them are using

387
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,198
the build of Sol 3.0 and then you're

388
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,838
going in and doing the feedings when do

389
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,439
the feedings start do you go like what

390
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,480
30 days or something before you actually

391
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,440
start doing the feedings or you just

392
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,519
like plant two weeks later adding in

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,399
fertilizer and then so on and so forth

394
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,959
like you mentioned it is

395
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,480
uh just play it and then 2 weeks later

396
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,039
that is when I start doing it after

397
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,039
transplanting into the bed um even after

398
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,000
harvesting I still continue to top dress

399
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,958
you know and so that way they just go

400
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
into it um so everything really never

401
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,119
breaks routine never breaks cycle

402
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,160
whether there's plants growing or not

403
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,120
like currently uh the 10x10 in my

404
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,439
basement is honed out for you the chill

405
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,600
out OG that you supplied me with at the

406
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,920
MJ biscon I have specifically dedicated

407
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,639
the 10x10 just to growing out the chill

408
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,159
out OG so this is my first time sexing

409
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,079
plants by the way and uh I'm really

410
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,919
excited to have the learning opportunity

411
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,159
especially the learning opportunity

412
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,439
being with your strain your genetic that

413
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,439
is exciting as hell man that's really

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
cool to hear that's awesome for those

415
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
that don't know I have a a cross I've

416
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,239
been working on for several years now

417
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,320
it's a Brisk gr G cross with Pakistan

418
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,480
Valley and uh named it chillo OG and uh

419
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,399
every time I hear somebody growing that

420
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,399
up it's just that Warmness feeling that

421
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,360
I get and then seeing it on Instagram

422
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,440
and and so on and so forth that's

423
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,639
awesome but now it's really cool that

424
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,800
you're dedicating a whole area to that

425
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,600
and I can't wait to see how it turns out

426
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,198
for you now for the feedings you

427
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
mentioned every couple weeks are you

428
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,240
come across any toxicity issues at all

429
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,599
it seems like pretty frequent feedings

430
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,879
at first if I felt like it it's just you

431
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,720
know taking their taking their suggested

432
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,000
amounts and really just sticking with

433
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,759
that and not doing anything over and um

434
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,039
I feel like jumping into it I was never

435
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,839
accurately taught to feed correctly I

436
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,599
was more so like he was doing his whole

437
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,240
life and everything but he was doing

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,360
Hydro he jumped into organic at the same

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,839
time that I started growing and um so it

440
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
was kind of learning experience for both

441
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,440
of us and the way I had learned through

442
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,959
him I felt like was just uh it was a

443
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,680
little bit too pungent like they were

444
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:28,000
getting some toxicity issues like maybe

445
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,239
it was uh too much honestly I I can't

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,759
remember the

447
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,159
but um afterwards I did just dilute my

448
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,120
stuff down a little bit and really

449
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,480
started reading the labels and

450
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,440
understanding you know overfeeding is

451
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,159
bad now it is I mean I think that's a

452
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
common misconception people think that

453
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,039
hey it's organic it's going to get

454
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,360
broken down over time slower the plant's

455
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,439
going to upake what it wants when it

456
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,639
wants it type thing but you can

457
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,000
absolutely have too much that have

458
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,639
broken down that cause toxicity issues

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,679
um particularly nitrogen toxicity I

460
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,759
think that's probably one one of the

461
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,479
most common ones that you see in organic

462
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,078
Gardens from over fertilizing so I was

463
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,240
just curious because it did seem like a

464
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,198
little bit more frequent than what I've

465
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
heard other people doing I personally do

466
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,798
it uh every 30 days I'll do a top

467
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,599
dressing I use the craft blend from

468
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,078
build the soil and I do one cup per

469
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,558
plant I've used other Blends in the past

470
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,759
but we were talking about the build AO

471
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,439
away here but what I used with build AO

472
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,519
is a craft blend and it's super easy you

473
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,279
can use that all the way out through uh

474
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,720
from Veg all the way through flowering

475
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,319
and um I've also used build a bloom

476
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,919
which you mentioned that you use had

477
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,960
some good results with that as well

478
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,200
definitely and I think the regiment that

479
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm feeding on is um it's more based

480
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,480
upon that I have so much or so many beds

481
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,200
of soil you know that I have to feed so

482
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,000
frequently maybe it's just uh they they

483
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,720
love it right now I feel like I've had

484
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
the best coloration in the leaves that

485
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,679
I've had ever before um everything is

486
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
turning out really really well they're

487
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,120
super super happy and I it's just

488
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,639
they're in veg right now so I'm trying

489
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,239
this regiment and I feel like you know

490
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,480
prior to this I was doing uh probably

491
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,519
about you know roughly every 30 days or

492
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,360
a little bit more just kind of

493
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,879
stretching it out like I said earlier to

494
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,599
uh learn just what'll happen if you

495
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,039
don't feed as much and uh I and I kind

496
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,959
of just shot a little into it with the

497
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,279
two weeks maybe it is a little bit much

498
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,200
um but I'm going to run consistency this

499
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,918
grow and uh if I don't think that it is

500
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,360
going to turn out you know something

501
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,759
like desirable I won't do it again I'll

502
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,839
start going back to the monthly area

503
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,079
maybe and just keep it tight on that you

504
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,240
mentioned you're growing larger plants

505
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,000
anyway so larger the plant the more

506
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,519
nutrition it's going to need so yeah it

507
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,599
makes sense now the additives you

508
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,639
mentioned rootwise and the microbial

509
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:46,158
inoculant how often are you using those

510
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,919
the rootwise um using those about every

511
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:52,080
or every other depending I use about

512
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,280
every other um what is it uh compost

513
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,879
t-ix and then what about watering you

514
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,038
know that's a common thing that I think

515
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,720
a lot of folks struggle with

516
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,440
particularly with Organic where it's

517
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,159
ideal to keep the medium moist at all

518
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,080
times so the microbes are active and you

519
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,720
get proper breakdown however hand

520
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,918
watering can be a little bit challenging

521
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,360
right letting dry outs in between has

522
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,200
some benefits so some people do that are

523
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,879
you handw watering or do you have an

524
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,159
auto watering system going how do you go

525
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,919
about that ah I love this topic this is

526
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:24,080
going to be fun I uh am an absolute fan

527
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,080
of the Eco with soil moisture sensors oh

528
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,279
my goodness they are the best things

529
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,678
ever um allowing me to see what the soil

530
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,079
moisture level is at all times that is

531
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,360
just being able to play God and I

532
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,639
absolutely adore that so thank you build

533
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,798
soil thank you Jeremy Silva uh for

534
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
pumping those videos out that led me on

535
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,639
to them I've got one here somewhere I

536
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,599
was going to show

537
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,360
it these are your Lifesaver if you're

538
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,519
new to Growing let this be the game

539
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,759
changer for you this is like the best

540
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,839
thing ever if you're growing in larger

541
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,400
beds and such it's it gets a little bit

542
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,158
hard to tell how much water's in in

543
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,919
there and so with those that really

544
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,640
changed my game cuz I feel like prior to

545
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,280
them I was overwatering and that was an

546
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,480
issue that I wasn't really you know too

547
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,359
familiar with my very first grow but I

548
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,319
think one of my plants did come out very

549
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,678
Anor robic in comparison to what you

550
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,038
know the other ones came out really like

551
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,000
Stout perfect and then it was a learning

552
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:22,798
experience on I overw waterer definitely

553
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,720
but um and I apply that with a Gard hose

554
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,400
I've got the blont system I I just

555
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,720
haven't put it all up yet and that's

556
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,440
that's the only thing uh finding the

557
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,319
time to get that all installed in there

558
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,880
is what I'm really just waiting on at

559
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,839
this point I love the blue mat system

560
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
that moisture meter I'm going to have to

561
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,959
search for it because I haven't even

562
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,640
heard of it I use the the blue M

563
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,640
moisture meter right now so I I am using

564
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,640
a moisture meter I think moisture meter

565
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,080
is one of those things that uh more

566
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,360
people probably should use you know it's

567
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,759
one of those things that a lot of people

568
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,000
don't use and it makes the job so much

569
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,440
easier I can't remember the video that

570
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,159
it was on but they always recommend

571
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,600
getting aam tensiometers it's something

572
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,960
that DET it detects the water levels in

573
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,480
your soil and they're really pricey and

574
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,079
I was about to purchase some but then I

575
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,079
realized I can get the soil moisture

576
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,879
sensors and they save me a lot of money

577
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,119
that's why I was so excited about those

578
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,520
personally um and in the blue mod I've

579
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,719
seen that they came out with those and I

580
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,200
haven't tried them yet what are your

581
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
views on those do you like them I love

582
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
them yeah it makes things so much easier

583
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,240
dialing it in you know you just get the

584
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
soil to the moisture level you that you

585
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,599
want that's ideal

586
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,240
then you install those carrot systems in

587
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,000
and then as the medium dries out just

588
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,798
drips down onto the medium and keeps it

589
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,480
at that consistent moisture level so

590
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,918
game changer for me um and then you're

591
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,839
just filling up a reservoir you know I'm

592
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,360
not going through hand watering

593
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,599
individual plants everything's all

594
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,558
connected to one reservoir so super easy

595
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,199
for me what do you got there me showing

596
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:55,200
on the screen right now you can see the

597
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,120
plants are at 37% 36% 35 and 35 and then

598
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,400
I can switch back and forth between Grow

599
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,798
rooms and uh I could check the stats

600
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,360
through all the uh days it's got like a

601
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,599
calendar on there and it also keeps uh

602
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,678
tabs on your vpds of your room even so

603
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:14,240
it's kind of like so many things in one

604
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,278
I love it and so I put uh I didn't just

605
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,558
make one video I made the first one and

606
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,480
I was like man I don't feel like that

607
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,278
did it justice so I came out with a

608
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,759
second Eco it video just to really pound

609
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,278
in how I was like and I'm one of those

610
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,038
people that I'm not sponsored by them I

611
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:32,558
just genuin feel like that was the the

612
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,038
single-handedly best thing that I did

613
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,839
you know what I mean that really changed

614
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,679
my grow uh other than you know all the

615
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,918
work that I've been doing with the

616
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,600
trellising lately but really trying to

617
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,559
just get it all canopi perfectly but

618
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,399
that was a game changer that was really

619
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,000
a game changer getting getting a hold of

620
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,000
those yeah I'm looking at it on Amazon

621
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,319
right now Eco wi 37 bucks and there a

622
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,240
10% coupon you can get show they have

623
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,839
sales and stuff and so there's just one

624
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,679
here do you have multiple of them for

625
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,839
each container or what do you

626
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,798
uh you can hold up to eight sensors per

627
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,759
Gateway and so you'll have to buy a

628
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,000
Gateway let's just say that's like a

629
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,640
Smart Hub right there that's going to

630
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,359
collect the information and send it to

631
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,559
your cell phone and then the

632
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,639
transmitters are what go into the soil

633
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,200
and so you can at all times see it

634
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,640
updates every minute so you have up to

635
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,600
the direct minute as to what your plants

636
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
levels are that's awesome yeah I'm

637
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,519
definitely going to scoop one of those

638
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,960
up for sure sounds like it's a

639
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,679
Improvement compared to what I'm doing

640
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,600
right now with the blue mat moisture

641
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,559
meter I have to go into the room and see

642
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,918
where it's at and it's really only good

643
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,960
for one container so yeah got to upgrade

644
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,240
stuff there for sure I love them now

645
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,840
also for watering one thing I wanted to

646
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,839
ask about is you mentioned it's out of a

647
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,079
hose are you filtering the water or do

648
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,639
you just have like a really good water

649
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,879
source I actually had a room built on

650
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,440
the side of the house and I only bring

651
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,200
that up due to the fact cuz I have a 55

652
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,080
gallon that's outside of it and then I

653
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,360
have a 55 gallon that's inside of it uh

654
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:57,439
and after watching one of your videos

655
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:01,439
recently I've decided to start phing my

656
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,798
water and so um the I don't filter it I

657
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
actually that one fills up through the

658
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,798
garden hose and then I've got a heat rod

659
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,000
in there so if it gets really cold out

660
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,558
it doesn't freeze and then I pump it

661
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,359
into the garden which goes through a

662
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,558
water chiller and then I've got bubblers

663
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,959
in the water at all times I use wedding

664
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:21,240
agents and I use a little bit of the uh

665
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,759
oh what's it called high Shield I think

666
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,798
and so I mix that in the water supply a

667
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,319
little bit as well and uh I don't have

668
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,918
any filtering going through it

669
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,960
necessarily I do have a couple like

670
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
layers of uh I think it's like a mesh

671
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,038
filter that goes over the pump before it

672
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,639
goes through the sprayer nozzle but

673
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,278
that's just for smaller stuff pretty

674
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
straightforward and then you said you do

675
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,359
pH your water so you got to have some

676
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,439
sort of when I checked it today before

677
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,879
doing the or was uh yesterday actually

678
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,679
but it was like

679
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,640
8.8 and then I dropped it down to about

680
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,480
6.5 somewhere around there but not okay

681
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,200
so comes up high to begin so safe side

682
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
yeah there's a lot of you know this is a

683
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,840
Hot Topic there's a lot of organic

684
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,880
Growers are like oh you don't need a pH

685
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,398
at all just boom water in no problem

686
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,039
right and then they swear by it but some

687
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,158
folks have high phes you know you said

688
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,119
you have in the eights I mean that's

689
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,320
pretty high so just about nine I can

690
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,719
imagine some people what they'll do is

691
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,639
they'll PH down in order to safeid it

692
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,839
and that's what I did and I learned that

693
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,480
from you and

694
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,079
Rob that's right I remember now I think

695
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,919
it was him talking about it if I'm not

696
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,879
mistaken yeah we made a video on from

697
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,520
the stash not too long go about all

698
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,480
about that maybe that's what it was from

699
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,720
and then do you know what the EC or the

700
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,200
PPM of the water is to begin or you have

701
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,519
a TDS tester to me measure that or no

702
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,880
nope never done it before in my life I

703
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,200
can't wait to learn after this because

704
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm totally looking that up yeah it was

705
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,759
just kind of interesting to know like

706
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,278
what's in your water source to begin I

707
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,278
have a very bad water source here my tap

708
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:55,119
water comes in at like 485 PPM and

709
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:57,319
that's a 500 scale TDS tester and so

710
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,519
that's High I mean the AP EPA there's

711
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,519
like warnings if it's over 500 they deem

712
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,480
it like not safe for drinking if it's

713
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,960
over 500 PPM so I'm like right there on

714
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,038
the line I've tried to use my tap water

715
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,720
before and uh unfortunately there's a

716
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,359
lot of sodium bicarbonates in it and

717
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,480
that stuff just builds up in the soil

718
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,678
and high ph and it just it cause so much

719
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
issues so I have to filter it you know

720
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,000
I've used regular just filter through

721
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,159
the britter before I've used it uh now I

722
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,720
use AO I just want to try to get as

723
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,120
clean as possible and then I used the

724
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,278
waste water from the Aro in my outdoor

725
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,759
Garden I some people have to filter

726
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,278
their water other people they're lucky

727
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,599
they don't need to I mean I've talked to

728
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,000
so many people who are like yeah my

729
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,519
natural PPM out the Taps like a 100

730
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,759
that's great you know it's all stuff

731
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,720
they can use calcium the iron you know

732
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:45,158
so on and so forth it is lucky so I was

733
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,880
just curious to see how your water

734
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,200
source was to begin and uh you know what

735
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,039
the pH came at it and were you adjusting

736
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,399
things or not oh and I just remembered

737
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,119
earlier when you were asking about

738
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:00,798
whether I sprayed um I do the top

739
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,479
watering uh with this really extended

740
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,558
garden sprayer so I can fit it under the

741
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,278
trellising and after I do that I wait

742
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,599
until they're into flower for a little

743
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,398
bit and I begin using the bottom water

744
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,639
feed that way the roots will start

745
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,639
building up down there too and and

746
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,120
correct me if I'm wrong but I was going

747
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,960
to say I think I watched an episode

748
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,119
where Jeremy Silva was talking about how

749
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,480
he likes to water on the top layers for

750
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,519
the initial of the gardening and then as

751
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,240
it goes into flower and progresses he

752
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,480
then begins watering from the bottom to

753
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,759
start building Roots down there as well

754
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,480
and then you know try to get your whole

755
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,079
bed like all roots and stuff and

756
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,399
basically they could when you go to

757
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,359
plant something they could tap into the

758
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,879
canals and just use the same root system

759
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,359
for a while as well so that was uh

760
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,919
mainly I just spray on the top then I

761
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,519
did the bottom after flowering maybe for

762
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:48,200
a week or so that's interesting yeah

763
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,440
build the soil away yeah I've seen

764
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,319
Jeremy do just that talk about that

765
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,840
watering from the top bottom watering

766
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,879
you know yeah I know he has Earth boxes

767
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,119
which is the bottom watering I have

768
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,080
tried to use organic and do bottle

769
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:02,959
watering through the auto pots didn't

770
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,639
have good luck and I think it's I live

771
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,079
in a very dry climate I have to say that

772
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,240
in every video and every podcast episode

773
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,038
but it's difficult for me to keep that

774
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,038
top layer moist and I've added mulch

775
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,919
layers um cardboard covers to try to

776
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,798
retain that moisture back then maybe it

777
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,600
wasn't staying as moist as it should

778
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,839
have and I just had problems you know

779
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,359
not having enough nutrition because of

780
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,119
the breakdown just wasn't there but

781
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,119
people swear by doing top dressing and

782
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,959
still just bottom watering and wicking

783
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,479
all the way up and making sure that top

784
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,278
layer is moist and they're getting the

785
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,519
breakdown they're being successful so I

786
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,480
think I need to kind of circle back

787
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,399
around and try the bottom watering with

788
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,558
Organic inputs top dressing and um see

789
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,398
if I can do it successfully cuz last

790
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:46,720
time you know now springing up the top

791
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:48,599
layer and stuff like that try to keep it

792
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,399
moist but I only go so far and there's

793
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,359
additional work there and so on and so

794
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,639
forth so I love to know in the comments

795
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,240
actually for those folks that are tuning

796
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,640
in on this that do grow with Organic

797
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,480
inputs and top dress or any of you just

798
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,000
bottom watering right not doing any top

799
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,599
watering whatsoever how what's your

800
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,880
experience with that let me know cuz I

801
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,038
want to see uh let's see if there's

802
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,399
other people struggling with it or if

803
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,919
it's just just me well the cool thing

804
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:13,599
with those Eco wits is they actually

805
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,080
notify me if it gets below 20 per s or

806
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,240
20 per 7 when it gets below 27% I get a

807
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,480
notification on my phone and before I go

808
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,000
to bed I never let a pot or bed or

809
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,240
anything get below

810
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,720
29% uh basically I just wake up in the

811
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,319
morning and I top them up to 42% that's

812
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,278
what Jeremy recommended and uh I've had

813
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,398
nothing but amazing results with that

814
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,038
it's been so fun except for the one time

815
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,518
I went out there and I had first got

816
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:39,759
them was really excited like a kid on

817
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,079
Christmas and I'm just watering and all

818
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,759
this stuff and I had one in the wrong

819
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,558
bag which equaled all of them being in

820
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,119
the wrong bags and I'm watering this one

821
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:48,918
it's like it's not going up in water

822
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,000
right and then all of a sudden I

823
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,679
realized they were in the wrong bags and

824
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,839
I had overwatered the other one and it

825
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,080
was like 60% that plant I think became

826
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,558
Anor robic after that

827
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,960
that was a huge learning experience and

828
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,918
so just make sure you put them in the

829
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,679
right bed and label them correctly and

830
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
they'll be the best things ever they

831
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,278
really are so cut dry simple you just

832
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,840
shove them in you're done and and you

833
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,839
sold me on that I'm going to have to buy

834
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,480
one of those right after this and try it

835
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,839
out that sounds like a big upgrade

836
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,640
sounds sounds like it makes things a lot

837
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:22,359
easier let's move on to environment

838
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,240
conditions so temperature humidity CO2

839
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,038
air

840
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,880
circulation what do you do for those

841
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,038
things just you know start wherever you

842
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,240
want on that one oh I'm a fan I love

843
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,960
vpds uh that was one of the first things

844
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,319
that I began to learn just the

845
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,480
importance of them and uh that was one

846
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,158
of the things that really caught me that

847
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,200
Jeremy Silva was able to translate to

848
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,000
where I could actually understand I feel

849
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,759
and then I came up with my own varant of

850
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,679
how to word it and I feel like it helped

851
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,599
a lot of people maybe uh when I put the

852
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,480
video out it hit like 5,000 views of

853
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,079
inst or instantly on that one and it was

854
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,679
uh basically just describe or explaining

855
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,000
it as like basically vpds are just a

856
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,200
distance between temperature and

857
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,839
humidity the further apart they are the

858
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,639
higher the number the closer they are

859
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,119
the lower the number like 70° or like

860
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,319
70% humidity is going to be like a

861
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,439
0.75 you know what I mean and it's just

862
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,519
a good like way of looking at it and so

863
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,440
I keep the troll Master System in my

864
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,798
mango uh I keep the vpds around 0.8 to

865
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,960
0.9 all the way up until the third week

866
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,519
of flowering and then I really start

867
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,440
cranking it in that's when I start

868
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,440
trying to drive the race car to my

869
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,360
room's full capacity uh I start cranking

870
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,360
the lights up I get my power meter to

871
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:39,038
about uh maybe like a th000 within the

872
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,879
like fourth week or so and then just

873
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,158
kind of I tune it up basically getting

874
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,440
it like a

875
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,639
1.25 on the uh vpds and then kind of

876
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,558
just from there as to weeks four and

877
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:54,519
five I think I go into like a 1.4 or 1.5

878
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,278
on the vpds just kind of really pull

879
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,759
them out to get them stressed at the end

880
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:00,038
there and you know

881
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,679
just kind of cater to it but that's kind

882
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:05,599
of the reason I like to do uh the room

883
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,120
the way I do instead of a Perpetual grow

884
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,038
I do all simultaneously they're all

885
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:14,719
growing uh from the same age basically I

886
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:18,798
basically like to cater my vpds to

887
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,240
towards the specific age of the plant if

888
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,079
the plant is coming in there as a

889
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,440
younger age I don't want to have harsh

890
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,119
vpds like 1.5 for instance I would

891
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,558
rather have vpds of 0.8 and with the

892
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,079
Perpetual grow you don't always have

893
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,558
that luxury due to the fact you're going

894
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,038
to be catering toward the plants that

895
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,558
are in their Prime the ones that are

896
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,519
going to be you know you're trying to

897
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,119
really stress out to get them to really

898
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:41,278
you know pop and so it's just a it's a

899
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,319
mixed bag it's kind of like a catch all

900
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,720
for a doctor's office you know like

901
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,319
everybody's coming in there for all

902
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,440
these different problems but there's one

903
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,678
doctor to handle everything and that's

904
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,200
kind of the way they're treating the

905
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,000
room I feel you know and so with the

906
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,960
basement grow I basically I've got the

907
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,558
knwa system and the NWA system is

908
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
phenomenal it's got a really easy to use

909
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,918
uh VPD chart that'll also show you if

910
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:10,158
your lights are on in there uh really

911
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,960
easy to you know manage the app some of

912
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,039
the apps can be difficult if you've got

913
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,880
you know like other brands and stuff

914
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,519
you'll see that their apps I don't want

915
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,200
to say any specific names but their apps

916
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,880
can be a little intimidating or

917
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,080
confusing when it as to niwa their app

918
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,440
is actually extremely easy to use

919
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:30,079
because they have a um a recipes chart

920
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,278
and the recipe chart saves your recipes

921
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,918
so you could just go in there and you

922
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,919
could put in cure and drying and that

923
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
way it saves every time so next time you

924
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,840
use it for your dry room boom you just

925
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,278
click on cure and drying or you can use

926
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:43,720
it in mango label it mang gr and have

927
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:47,159
presets already made for it and so your

928
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:52,839
vpds will carry over and uh then in my 8

929
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:55,840
by8 I'm running 60 and 60 on the curing

930
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:59,558
so in my uh dry tent I'm curing them at

931
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:02,000
about 60 and 6 in there for 6060 method

932
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,960
yeah very common there now backing up to

933
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,839
VPD you know I have some folks here that

934
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,079
don't really pay attention to VPD

935
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,519
they're more old school I'm I'm in the

936
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,240
same boat whereas like I still

937
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,280
temperature humidity you know I kind of

938
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,959
look at the VPD and I have my controller

939
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,399
set up for VPD so I stay within the

940
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,199
ranges but like what's the temperature

941
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,519
that you kind of get up to at the

942
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,358
highest and then same thing with like

943
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,878
humidity do you know like what it kind

944
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,918
of adjusts to for the different stages

945
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:32,039
of growth or yeah um usually running

946
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,319
around 76 to 78 in there all throughout

947
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,440
the vegetative state um I usually keep

948
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,159
the humidity not too far apart from that

949
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,800
it'll be around um maybe 65 or so in

950
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,320
there on humidity and then as we go into

951
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,519
later stages I will begin to stretch

952
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,720
those things apart you know I'll really

953
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,519
let the temperature go up because I'm

954
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,480
running CO2 which allows me to get up to

955
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,800
around 83° in there and I don't want to

956
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,280
so I try to keep it a little bit lower

957
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,720
than that I keep it around 80 1 or so

958
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,119
and uh I just uh start slowly pulling

959
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,559
away the humidity I get it down to

960
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,039
probably down to 60 maybe maybe 65 is

961
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,519
somewhere around there and then the

962
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,639
temperature will start to go up too as

963
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,599
the grow progresses that is got it yeah

964
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,440
so that makes sense as far as um

965
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,920
matching that up to the vpg Chart seeing

966
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,079
the dark green range what you mentioned

967
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,519
for temperature and humidity kind of

968
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,039
it's in line from what I'm looking at

969
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:28,920
right here I look at the pulse grow.com

970
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,440
they have a great article all about VPD

971
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,760
and they have different charts for the

972
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,559
different stages of growth so if anybody

973
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,359
is looking to learn more about VPD and

974
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,960
see the different charts you can Google

975
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:41,400
pulse VPD charts and it's going to give

976
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,000
you uh there's a first one's the charts

977
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,639
second link is the guide very in-depth

978
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,519
guide talks about daytime VPD nighttime

979
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,519
VPD and so on and so forth so really

980
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,759
good stuff there now you mentioned CO2

981
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,440
can we get into that a little bit can

982
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,160
you kind of break down like what you do

983
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,519
for CO2 using a tank or or what I use a

984
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:04,559
uh CO2 generator I'm running propane

985
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,280
underneath of it and um I love it I

986
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,880
consider it steroids for my plants and

987
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,839
it allows you to drive your car a little

988
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,720
bit faster it allows you to uh really

989
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,358
push them and uh they got a little bit

990
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:17,318
more strength to them but in order to do

991
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,719
so you generally will want a sealed

992
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:20,318
environment or else you're just going to

993
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,078
be expend you're going to be leaking

994
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:25,679
your CO2 out

995
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,400
constantly um but I run typically I'll

996
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,118
keep it around 1,000 and then I'll bump

997
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,358
it up like a 100 or so each and every uh

998
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,880
week that goes by until I get to 1,500

999
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,880
generally like um I don't do the fuzzy

1000
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,440
logic or anything I just try to keep it

1001
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,079
consistent as like uh around like 1,400

1002
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,039
and then a little bit higher so that it

1003
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,720
doesn't exceed 1500 just because you

1004
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,279
would be wasting it if it does they

1005
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,838
can't take in any more after 1500 if I'm

1006
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,079
understanding that correctly that's

1007
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,519
another thing that you mentioned the

1008
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,839
frequent feedings well there's a

1009
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,440
contributing factor right you're running

1010
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,880
CO2 it's going to drive your plants

1011
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,358
faster to like you mentioned uh and it's

1012
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,480
going to need more nutrition in the

1013
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,119
medium so yeah that kind of brings it

1014
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,838
full circle and kind of makes sense to

1015
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,280
the more frequent feedings I was

1016
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,759
wondering if I was wrong whenever you

1017
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,760
brought it up earlier and you you

1018
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,520
brought up the 30 days and I'm like man

1019
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
I guess I am feeding a little bit more

1020
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,480
like why is it that I'm having to feed

1021
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,200
so much and that could be a big variant

1022
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,719
into you know that well there's so many

1023
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,719
different ways to go about it and the

1024
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,439
the 30- days is just kind of a general

1025
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,759
guideline I think like on um I've also

1026
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,318
using the kiss Organics nutrient pack I

1027
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,240
believe on the instructions it says top

1028
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,480
dress every 30 days I think it says on

1029
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,639
the build of soil instructions too if I

1030
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,800
remember correctly but uh General

1031
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,838
recommendation I've done every two weeks

1032
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,200
before in the past but I found no

1033
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:48,239
difference going from every two weeks to

1034
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,559
every month um so I just been sticking

1035
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,679
with every month and I don't supplement

1036
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,000
CO2 I mean I grow smaller plants than it

1037
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,318
sounds like you grow you had mentioned

1038
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,400
you grow larger plants so um yeah

1039
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:58,119
there's so many different ways to go

1040
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,720
about it yeah it's interesting to hear

1041
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,000
the different ways you know your your

1042
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:03,838
way of doing it yeah I started out with

1043
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,519
it and so learning how to do it off the

1044
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,920
rip was a big thing um it was a fun

1045
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,440
procedure and I did find out the troll

1046
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,240
Master is phenomenal for that and uh I

1047
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,639
love that system it makes it so easy to

1048
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,399
manage just hop on and change your CO2

1049
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,838
levels whenever I've got exhaust fand in

1050
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,480
there in case it gets a little too high

1051
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,838
or excessive on it so definitely like

1052
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,358
when when I'm in the working cuz I've

1053
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,199
actually got dual exhaust in there so if

1054
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:30,639
I'm in there working a lot and actually

1055
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,480
breaking a sweat I then begin producing

1056
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,799
a lot more CO2 and I'll see it actually

1057
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,079
hit you know nearly like

1058
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,160
22200 and that's when I'm like wow cuz

1059
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,920
the dual exhaust kicks on it it's pretty

1060
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,598
neat you know and one exhaust just

1061
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,960
wasn't doing it like it wasn't flushing

1062
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,119
it enough to keep up with the amount of

1063
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,679
breathing because my room is so airtight

1064
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,680
and so I had to go ahead and do another

1065
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,078
one through the ceiling actually with

1066
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,799
all the grow lights running are you

1067
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,318
running in any heat issues where the

1068
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,599
Heat's just going too high and then you

1069
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:58,159
got to exhaust that out and you're

1070
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,318
losing some of the CO2 or or no boy it's

1071
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,639
been a learning curve on that one buddy

1072
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:04,800
that it has I uh I struggled at the

1073
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,960
beginning of that one I was so excited

1074
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,000
when I was like okay I'm going to put

1075
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,559
five scorpion Diablos in one room and

1076
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,159
they're all going to have UV bars and

1077
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,960
then 16 AC Infinities no one thinks

1078
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:19,000
about oh my God it gets so hot in there

1079
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:23,159
so quick it was Unreal it it like it

1080
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,280
broke my last uh my last um mini split

1081
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:29,118
and so I mean me too but still anyway

1082
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,119
it's uh I had to replace it with the 12K

1083
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,800
mini split and it just it wasn't keeping

1084
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,599
up and during the process of doing so I

1085
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,440
had two 10,000 BTU AC units in my room

1086
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,519
to substitute the mini split while I was

1087
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,440
down and being installed and it still

1088
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,639
wasn't enough it actually was still

1089
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,559
getting almost to 90° in there and I had

1090
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,440
all of them dimmed down and everything

1091
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,838
it was such a catastrophe when the AC

1092
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,760
unit went out but now I've got a brand

1093
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,400
new one in there and I'm really excited

1094
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,200
about it it's actually keeping up really

1095
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,358
well but boy when you crank those lights

1096
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:03,078
up everything changes it is seriously an

1097
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,960
entire different ball game um the

1098
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,359
temperature can Elevate literally 10° in

1099
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,960
the blink of an eye if you're not

1100
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,440
monitoring it closely at times you know

1101
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,639
and that's where I'm so open or I'm so

1102
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,480
happy to have trollmaster because that

1103
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,480
has safety netted me the whole way

1104
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,599
through uh if if uh if it gets to a

1105
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,358
certain temperature in there my exhaust

1106
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,039
system will kick on and so that way it

1107
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,880
will uh definitely flush the room and

1108
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,039
then at the same at the same degree it

1109
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,000
also could detect if the boards get more

1110
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,239
than I think 92° or so and then it'll

1111
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,639
shut the light it'll dim the lights down

1112
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:41,679
and so that'll also reduce the

1113
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,639
temperature in the room and uh but yeah

1114
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:47,199
having that many lights in there is

1115
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,838
definitely uh a lot to negotiate or to

1116
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,639
navigate that's the word I was looking

1117
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,880
for yeah sounds like it could be a

1118
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,239
serious problem I've run into heat

1119
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,119
issues I think a lot of people have run

1120
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:57,838
into heat issues you know not realizing

1121
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,599
that the heat was going to build up that

1122
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,759
quickly and then uh and then the

1123
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,800
temperature being too high and then you

1124
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,640
get exhaust and balancing is is easier

1125
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,720
said than done you know balancing the

1126
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:10,639
environment conditions there so keep a

1127
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,399
backup fan that's one thing I've learned

1128
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,719
a big fan that could really haul some

1129
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,559
wind like a little bit like all right so

1130
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,759
the the floor vacuums you know they lay

1131
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,279
on the floor basically they shoot

1132
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
outward you get one of those they'll

1133
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,960
throw the wind out of there Open Your

1134
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,039
Door up and do that just to vent your

1135
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,760
room as fast as you can but that saved

1136
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,880
my butt during that procedure or that

1137
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,920
process

1138
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,000
got to do what you got to do right

1139
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,519
definitely so I want to ask about some

1140
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,960
more problems you've faced and how you

1141
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,440
corrected them talking about the build

1142
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,240
so away you mentioned your newer grower

1143
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,639
couple years under your belt what other

1144
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,479
problems have you kind of run into and

1145
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:48,480
what Solutions did you do to correct

1146
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,880
those problems bugs they're the devil um

1147
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,280
and diet ous Earth it is also the devil

1148
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,160
um just because and I know everybody

1149
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,319
loves diet mous Earth but you

1150
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:01,879
I don't know maybe I was excessive but I

1151
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,880
hate cleaning charcoal filters

1152
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,200
constantly and that it gets everywhere I

1153
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,680
mean it's everywhere you can't get it

1154
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,598
out at time when you have a larger room

1155
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:15,799
it's it's definitely something to Veer

1156
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,318
away from in my eyes um but yeah it

1157
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,720
definitely forever I feel like I had had

1158
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,318
to clean my charcoal filters

1159
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:25,279
continuously when I was using it I

1160
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,639
stopped it uh it'll fill up your AC unit

1161
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,599
filter it'll fill clog up everything it

1162
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,078
feels like were you putting on your

1163
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,838
plants or on your soil no no no yeah on

1164
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,400
the soil okay you can put on the soil

1165
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,960
you can put it you know on the floors if

1166
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,480
need be and they always recommend that

1167
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,920
too but that's just another thing you

1168
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,240
know it was just going airborne huh it

1169
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,519
was going airborne and getting up into

1170
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:45,399
your filters everywhere yeah that that

1171
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,358
stuff's it's have you used had that

1172
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,800
problem that's interesting like what do

1173
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,440
you how do you use it how do you apply

1174
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,480
it I would just sprinkle on top of the

1175
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,920
medium you know cuz fungus knats is one

1176
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,559
of the things that I ran into I run into

1177
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,079
pretty frequently particularly when I'm

1178
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,200
grabbing a new bag of soil if I need to

1179
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,039
grabb a new bag of soil now these days

1180
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,358
I'm reusing my soil and kind of worked

1181
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,199
out those fungus kns I don't have them

1182
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,799
as much but diet tomati is something

1183
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,318
that you know quite a few people use for

1184
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,440
battling the fungus NS that's why I got

1185
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,800
them initially until I discovered this

1186
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,358
little hack all right so you know

1187
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,720
mosquito bits I'm sure you've heard of

1188
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,759
them oh yep use those to as well yeah

1189
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,279
but uh I take my water supply and I'll

1190
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,839
take like a plastic glove and I don't

1191
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,680
know if this is the best thing but I'll

1192
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,519
put the mosquito bit or bits into the

1193
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,960
plastic glove and I'll tie it off and

1194
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,960
poke holes in it and throw it into my

1195
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,199
water supply and it literally killed

1196
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,400
every net um in my either of my girls I

1197
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,838
have zero Nets none they can be tough to

1198
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,599
battle my way of going about it right

1199
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,799
now is you obviously yellow stickies

1200
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,920
right those definitely help catch the

1201
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,559
adult ones that are flying around but

1202
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,358
Mammoth can control man that stuff works

1203
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,880
so good like I spray that thing and and

1204
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,239
it knocks down the population and then

1205
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,559
of course the The larva hatches and then

1206
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,558
more kind of fly up spray do another

1207
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,160
application and then uh you know two

1208
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,200
three applications and they're prettyy

1209
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:05,239
much gone for me so that or also Dr the

1210
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:07,279
amazing Dr zes is another very works

1211
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:10,078
very very well those are the two that I

1212
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,040
really like Dr zes is awesome I love Dr

1213
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,839
zes any other problems that you've come

1214
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:18,519
across mhm yeah a couple uh spiderm

1215
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,440
they're man they're something you just

1216
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,559
really really want to get on them and

1217
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,800
you know check your plants every day you

1218
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,599
know be out there make sure you're not

1219
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,039
getting them and if they if you do get

1220
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,240
them get on it really really quick

1221
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,759
that's all I've got to say cuz when I

1222
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,598
was out in Vegas with you guys spider BS

1223
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,040
took over an area that I just didn't see

1224
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,559
in that downstairs garden and so that's

1225
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,759
why it's all cleared out for your grow I

1226
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,400
just said screw it they were all in

1227
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,240
vegetative state and I just hacked them

1228
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,760
down there you know nothing really

1229
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:48,679
special so um spiderm that was my first

1230
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,720
time with them and I was just like wow

1231
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,318
it happened so fast I was like cuz when

1232
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,919
I first noticed him we were about to

1233
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,558
head to Vegas and I was spraying for him

1234
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,240
and everything and uh

1235
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,880
I went out there and got back and it

1236
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,919
they took over like a whole section

1237
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,559
immediately it felt like while in that

1238
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,200
one you know two-day period of time it

1239
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,079
was just the whole corner of my garden I

1240
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,239
was like no I'm done with this so uh

1241
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:13,760
I've I've uh

1242
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,399
began actually what I started doing was

1243
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,920
the rotation between different uh

1244
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,079
whether it be I think it's called I

1245
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,079
wrote it down plant therapy but I think

1246
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,400
it's from Lost Coast is the is the is

1247
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,200
the maker of it but yeah plant therapy

1248
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,000
Dr zes uh Captain Jack's dead bug those

1249
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:34,039
are all awesome and if you take the

1250
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,318
three of them and do them in rotation

1251
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:39,558
that way you don't get zombie

1252
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:42,558
mites but uh I had no issues especially

1253
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,559
with that new AC Infinity uh mister have

1254
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,000
you tried that thing yeah that thing's

1255
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,480
awesome man the pumpless one battery

1256
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,679
operated just sprays consistently that

1257
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,119
thing's incredible that thing is

1258
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,799
gold that thing is so great the Mist

1259
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,200
level is stupendous like I got a couple

1260
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:04,160
other ones I got a Ryobi One and uh it

1261
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:06,439
was on Amazon for $17 and uh it was good

1262
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,358
but then when I got that I was like wow

1263
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,639
it saves so much time I have a lot of

1264
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:12,159
big plants and all that foliage it's

1265
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,039
just a lot to cover but when you have

1266
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,519
something like that that was pretty cool

1267
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,558
that makes it a lot easier so I'm able

1268
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,759
to keep up on it with a lot more ease

1269
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,040
now makes it so much easier man those

1270
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,559
pump ones I mean GE to spend time

1271
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,400
pumping and then the the pressure it's

1272
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,720
built off of pressure so like you have

1273
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,240
reductions in the pressure and it sprays

1274
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:34,639
inconsistent problem solved with the AC

1275
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:37,039
Infinity one consistent the Mist levels

1276
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,838
really well yeah it's it's awesome I

1277
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:42,358
love it do you do sunrise and sunset

1278
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,960
have you heard much on it no I I stopped

1279
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:45,639
doing the sunrise sunset I used to do it

1280
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,119
back in the day but ever since Dr Bruce

1281
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,400
bugby mentioned that uh they did a study

1282
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,160
on it and they were just measuring the

1283
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,880
rate of photosynthesis and he said that

1284
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:57,639
the plants that had the lights come on

1285
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,039
immediately was able to take the photons

1286
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:02,318
the photosynthesis rate was able to be

1287
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,920
up there so I've just been going with

1288
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:06,039
the lights on right off the bat ever

1289
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,559
since I heard him say that dude that's

1290
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:10,838
cool as hell what about this other one

1291
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,519
I'm hearing I love it uh I took my son's

1292
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:15,960
sound machine I took it apart and uh I

1293
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,519
made a little noise machine it it had

1294
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,679
lights on it I took all the LED lights

1295
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,199
off so that I could use it in the night

1296
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:22,558
time but I have Birds tripping in there

1297
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,279
constantly to help with like opening the

1298
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,240
stamatas like uh you you been get any of

1299
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,359
that yet anything or have you dug into

1300
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,598
it yet I have not heard about birds

1301
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,838
chirping opening the stamata that's uh

1302
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,559
that's a new one for me right it just

1303
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:39,558
sounded so interesting and so I'm trying

1304
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,440
it now I my son's sound machine he

1305
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,800
didn't need it anymore and it has this

1306
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,480
option for birds and so I was like all

1307
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,200
right I pulled it apart took the LED

1308
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,000
lights out and I put it in the grow room

1309
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,759
and it sounds like amazing in there like

1310
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,159
a rainforest there's just Birds tripping

1311
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,280
all the time in there so people are like

1312
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,558
watching my

1313
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,880
videos I'm watching of I'm sitting like

1314
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,680
I hear birds tripping the whole time

1315
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,720
well if uh if you guys watch the videos

1316
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:04,919
and see that or hear that that's what it

1317
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,358
is that you're hearing is uh my son's

1318
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,039
old sound machine yeah that's the new

1319
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,880
one for me bird strip and I hear about

1320
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,558
uh people singing to their plants you

1321
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,200
back in the day they like yeah they

1322
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,160
swore by if you sing to your plants

1323
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:19,039
they're going to grow better and come to

1324
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,078
find out it was just exhaling the CO2 so

1325
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,558
you're giving more CO2 to your plants so

1326
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,400
that's why they were doing better oh

1327
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,359
yeah it's not so much the singing people

1328
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,160
were playing music and stuff

1329
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:29,880
playing it loudly some people say that

1330
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,759
hey that's not doing anything at all

1331
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,920
it's got to be a jet engine you know

1332
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,359
sound in order for it to actually make

1333
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,838
an impact but I don't know I've never

1334
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:39,679
really tested that out to be honest with

1335
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,078
you hell yeah I figured if anybody would

1336
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,078
knew or if anybody knew it' be you so I

1337
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,200
was like a I figured I'll ask him but uh

1338
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,039
yeah it could be one of those Bro

1339
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:49,798
Science ones I think it was actually

1340
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:51,239
like on a uh I probably just seen

1341
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:53,599
something on Facebook going by you know

1342
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,679
what I mean it's like oh yeah the birds

1343
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,480
chirping opens the stamatas or something

1344
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,480
like that but I definitely want to look

1345
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,159
into it I think it was um

1346
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,920
corn or that was playing music too

1347
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:07,960
that's that's yeah the jazz music the

1348
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,119
guy growing corn who had a bigger crop

1349
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,079
than his uh neighbors and they were like

1350
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:16,480
what did you do differently he's like I

1351
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:19,079
started playing jazz music yeah so

1352
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,280
that's fun to think about yeah that's

1353
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,720
funny like to see more information about

1354
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,559
the the birds chirping one right all

1355
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:29,159
these different techniques and styles

1356
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,920
and theories it's it's crazy to see what

1357
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:32,239
they come up with you know so many

1358
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,079

doing that we hav't got into like

1365
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,759
environment conditions and some problems

1366
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,639
you faced and been a fun episode talking

1367
