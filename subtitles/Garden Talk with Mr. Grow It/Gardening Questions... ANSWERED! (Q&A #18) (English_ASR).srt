11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,980
in a future episode okay let's get into

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,480
some questions I wanted to ask you out

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,480
of all the different watering methods

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,579
you've done blue mats Auto Parts bottom

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,799
watering Etc what's your personal

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,299
favorite way I'm gonna be trying a fully

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,479
organic grow next time and I'm looking

18
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,459
for the best way to be as hands off as I

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,759
can sort of all those methods

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,039
particularly with Organics I liked the

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,280
blue mats I still run the blue mats I

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,899
was using the individual carrots for all

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,058
the containers up until seven gallons

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,160
and I was using two carrots one on each

25
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,959
side of the container and now I'm in 10

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,000
gallons and I'm actually about to

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,500
install distribution drippers so

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,479
something you might want to look at if

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,680
you haven't already I'm not just using

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,560
the carrots I'm not sure what size

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,000
container you're in but uh if you're

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,740
going with a larger container you might

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
want to do the distribution drippers or

34
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,438
you can just do what I did which was

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,359
just have two different carrots one on

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,279
kind of each side of the stock each side

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,859
of the container really and then as they

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,299
dry out they just drop down and that has

39
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,879
been really easy when it comes to

40
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,520
Organics I tried the auto pots in the

41
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,560
past works great with synthetics plant

42
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,599
available nutrients with the Organics

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,180
for me maybe it's just the client I'm

44
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,099
living in but having that top layer

45
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,500
moist at all times where the amendments

46
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,599
are is difficult it was difficult for me

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,459
so I was seeing yellowing of the plants

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,259
I've just had much better results using

49
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,019
the blue mats because really it's a top

50
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,239
down drill up and uh I've been really

51
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,819
liking the nutrient well technique and I

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,158
was a very controversial technique there

53
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,898
basically what that is is you kind of

54
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,540
dig a little hole in there to put the

55
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,759
amendments in that one hole and then the

56
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,320
regular blue mat dripper drips down onto

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,578
that one spot where you have the

58
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,379
nutrient well and that has been working

59
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,419
out fantastic for me for the past two to

60
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,280
three runs so I'm continuing to do that

61
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,959
yes you are disturbing the root Zone a

62
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,659
little bit as you're digging down into

63
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,819
the medium but for me being able to keep

64
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,919
that part of the medium moist those

65
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,719
amendments moist for proper breakdown so

66
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,399
they can then after they're broken down

67
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,979
be uptaken by the plant it's been

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
beneficial to run that so I personally

69
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,318
like the blue mats over any of the other

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,359
methods that you have mentioned what new

71
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,000
smart technology interests you these

72
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,739
days got to give a shout out to Mars

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,259
Hydro they're actually sponsoring this q

74
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,180
a episode I think their smart growth

75
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,939
system is pretty interesting these days

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,459
basically you get their ihub smart power

77
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,318
strip download their app and then

78
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,360
register on the app then you can hook up

79
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,518
their grow lights I mean their FC series

80
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,800
fce series it's compatible with other

81
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,039
grow lights of theirs you can set the

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,379
sunrise sunset control the intensity you

83
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,179
can also hook up the inline fan to it

84
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,739
and you can have specific environment

85
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,420
conditions that kind of trigger that fan

86
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,759
to come on and off humidifier

87
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,859
dehumidifier fan and even your heat map

88
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,259
can be plugged into it as well and also

89
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,360
it's not only Bluetooth but Wi-Fi

90
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,098
connectivity it has so there's

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,200
definitely more to it I'm not going to

92
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,219
list everything here in this q a but if

93
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,439
you want to learn more for more

94
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,439
information go to the website Mars

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,239
hydro.com link will be in the YouTube

96
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,400
description section below and you can

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,980
use discount code Mr Grow it actually

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,319
works for any of Mars hydros products

99
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,060
how do you feed with blue mats kind of

100
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,039
just talking about that and the other

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,019
question basically if you're using the

102
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,120
organic amendments typically what people

103
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,439
do is they'll do that initial mending in

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,299
the soil you know with whatever

105
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,158
fertilizer blend you're using for

106
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,900
example or if you use an individual your

107
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,818
amendments then from there you've

108
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,819
stalled the blue Maps if you're doing

109
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,780
any additional top dressing like I

110
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:53,458
mentioned earlier I was doing the

111
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,378
nutrient well technique some people do

112
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,120
spread it across the entire medium just

113
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,280
top dress that way or if you're using

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,560
synthetics you would just have your

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,299
bottled nutrients mixed into your

116
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,039
Reservoir it's a gravity Fed so the

117
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,540
reservoir actually has to be higher the

118
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,699
way your plants are so it'll come down

119
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,979
gravity fed and when I was using

120
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,539
synthetics just really changed out the

121
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,699
media changing out the reservoir each

122
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,620
week so I'm kind of going by the feeding

123
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,298
chart I know depending on what plant

124
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,100
you're growing typically looking at the

125
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,198
feeding chart half dose is what I

126
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,180
typically do sometimes even a quarter

127
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,740
dose especially with the blue mats might

128
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,959
want to start with a quarter dose to

129
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,340
begin plants could be perfectly healthy

130
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,019
with just that quarter dose and

131
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,399
sometimes I just had Cal Mag in the

132
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,019
reservoir and that had worked out pretty

133
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,478
good for a little while I was doing the

134
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,698
kind of syngantic grow I had Fox Farm

135
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,099
motion 4 soil which has nutrients in it

136
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,600
started out with that and then had Cal

137
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,680
Mag in the reservoir and it was just

138
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,199
dripping down that cow mag and then

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
course I went to a more like a Bloom

140
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,160
fertilizer when I was in flowering but

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,918
just for fed fetch only I was able to

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,780
get away with just the Fox Farm soil and

143
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,719
then the cow mag along with it do you

144
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,219
prefer Bowl trimming or sheer trimming

145
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,380
great question I know a lot of people

146
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,320
going more towards the bowl trimmer

147
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,879
these days and I don't have one yet I

148
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,439
think I probably will get one in the

149
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,120
future I've heard some good things about

150
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,860
the bowl trimmer I've heard some bad

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,360
things about the bowl trimmer I think

152
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,740
there's a lot of misinformation when it

153
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,960
comes to the Bowl trimmer because a lot

154
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,759
of people that I've talked to that have

155
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,859
had good success with it's you know the

156
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
whole trichomes falling off I'm sure

157
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,879
that there are but I'm sure that's not

158
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,138
completely ruining the crop by using a

159
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,819
bowl trimmer I know there's some

160
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,939
downsides of using a bull trimmer is

161
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:33,120
that I guess apparently that fluffier

162
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,279
type larfier type or more airier type of

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,840
buds don't do well so it's going to be

164
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,459
the density kind of has to be there in

165
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,859
order for that bowl term to work I've

166
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,538
just been hand trimming all these years

167
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,220
so but I definitely want to try out one

168
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,560
of the bull trimmers in the future how

169
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,259
does your outdoor Garden do in your

170
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,720
desert Summers I'm subtropical with

171
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,280
really hot temps in the summer so most

172
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,520
of the time I'm actually not growing

173
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,319
outdoors in the summer particularly

174
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,859
vegetables winter time it's great you

175
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,560
know I can grow kale lettuce bok choy

176
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,840
spinach that's mostly what I have I just

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,300
have a small two foot by 10 foot raised

178
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,879
bed in my backyard it's actually a

179
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,800
living soil fabric pot raised bed and

180
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,199
that's been working out great over the

181
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,639
years but here in the summer time if you

182
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,740
try to grow those things they're going

183
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,019
to bolt like the lettuce and the spinach

184
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,060
and so on and so forth so they can

185
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,060
really only take temperatures of high

186
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,439
70s and then they'll start to bolt so I

187
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,360
personally don't grow those things in

188
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,459
the summertime what I will grow in the

189
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,939
summer Peppers you can also get away

190
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:39,180
with melons as well I've grown a Maduras

191
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,759
sweet melon does really really well in

192
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,560
the desert region so if you are you know

193
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,240
growing outdoors and it's really hot

194
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,699
where you live definitely do some

195
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,620
research and figure out what plants are

196
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,300
good for that climate because the last

197
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,280
thing you want to do is is plant some

198
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,900
things where it's they can't handle the

199
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,459
temperature and then they just bolt and

200
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,439
then you can't do anything with them

201
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,939
anymore so so yeah what are your

202
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,219
thoughts on adding CO2 with mushroom

203
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,379
bags I've tried it and I have seen an

204
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,539
increase using it I know a lot of people

205
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,219
it's uh it's crazy what you read in the

206
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,978
comments section these days I mean I've

207
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,080
made content on these mushroom bags and

208
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,418
uh they're people like oh this is a scam

209
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,698
it doesn't work blah blah blah I don't

210
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,859
know if they're using a CO2 meter or not

211
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,020
to kind of make those measurements the

212
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,780
CO2 meter that I have a micro tent did

213
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,060
show an increase now I didn't do any

214
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,978
specific studies on it to tell you for

215
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,660
sure like at this time it worked better

216
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,839
than this time I just had the mushroom

217
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,240
bags in there and then looked at my CO2

218
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,500
monitor randomly and then have seen an

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,918
increase you know I've been able to get

220
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,959
it up to it was uh 800 to 1200 PPM is

221
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,060
roughly what it ranged for with those

222
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,258
mushroom bags so they worked out pretty

223
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,478
good same thing with like the team Bay

224
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,120
Naturals I mean very similar in the

225
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,219
sense at least as far as me looking in

226
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,379
my grow tent and seeing what the levels

227
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,380
are and seeing that the CO2 levels were

228
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,180
elevated so they worked for me as far as

229
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,418
how long they work I can't really tell

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,098
you and how well they work really it's

231
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,659
going to depend also on how much you're

232
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,159
exhausting the air how to grow space

233
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,199
right because I don't want your grill

234
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,360
light turns on you might have to exhaust

235
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,919
some of the hot air oh comes the CO2

236
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,060
with it I think that's another reason

237
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,680
why a lot of people say it's just not

238
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,240
worth it a lot of people's opinion on

239
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,978
that one at what point in flower should

240
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,220
I Max on my grow light wattage what grow

241
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:26,098
light are you using are using HPS using

242
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,900
LED some LED grow lights you don't even

243
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,939
need to Max them out especially it

244
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,098
depends on your what Your CO2 is if

245
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,179
you're running increased CO2 sometimes

246
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,399
that you're going to add in a little bit

247
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,199
higher light intensity but a lot of

248
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,899
these grow like these days people aren't

249
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,719
actually running them at 100 now if you

250
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,839
demand to run at 100 let's say perfect

251
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,700
world 100 is good at the manufacturer

252
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,500
recommended like distance the point of

253
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,540
flowering I would do that probably

254
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,519
within the first three weeks really is

255
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:55,319
what I would try to max out the light at

256
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,560
it's in the first three weeks generally

257
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,080
speaking 600 to 900 ppfd in the

258
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
flowering stage if you are looking to

259
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,500
get a little bit higher than that if

260
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,179
you're adding CO2 looking to get a

261
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,339
little bit higher some people go upwards

262
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,139
of 1200 commercial facilities go even

263
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,140
higher than that of course you've also

264
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,000
got to look at your EC might be a little

265
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,419
bit more difficult to do this running

266
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,580
Organics versus being in more controlled

267
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,679
environment where hydroponically for

268
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,379
example we have that EC and you're able

269
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,359
to change that very easily but yeah

270
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,458
roughly first three weeks is when I'd be

271
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,959
looking to max out that grill light how

272
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,599
do you tell the difference between autos

273
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,699
and photos I think the only really way

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,560
to tell the difference is if they start

275
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,320
to automatically flower or not yeah

276
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,139
that's kind of a Elementary answer but

277
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,260
you can't really plant an auto plant a

278
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:48,958
photo have them grow up two three weeks

279
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,700
and be able to tell the difference just

280
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,259
by looking at them right they look the

281
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,640
same so the only way to really tell the

282
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,278
difference is if one starts to

283
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,559
automatically flower or not and that's

284
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,299
usually around day 30 from Sprout would

285
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,500
you say 22 inches is a safe distance

286
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,479
between light and top of the plant

287
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,879
depends on the light not all lights are

288
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,399
created equal some that'll be fine

289
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,580
others that will not be fine for example

290
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,278
one of the uh geez what is it kind LED

291
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,680
uh what was their old mono light with

292
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,159
the blurple that thing had to be like 24

293
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,139
to 36 inches away because in 22 would

294
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,120
have been too close but most LED

295
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,059
grillouts these days 22 inches should be

296
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,399
fine even in flowering some go as low as

297
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,099
12 inches away it really depends on what

298
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,559
grow light your you have I see some

299
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,240
Growers only use an inline fan when

300
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,759
dragging their tent you still use an

301
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,159
oscillating fan in your dry tent I would

302
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,480
always use an oscillating fan in the

303
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,939
grow 10 it would be on the bottom of the

304
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,100
grow tent and it would blow the air

305
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,560
around so that air would be circulating

306
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,220
at all times I know some people do run

307
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:55,379
the inline fans as well that works I do

308
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,600
believe in air exchange I typically do

309
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,338
once every 24 hours I'm exchanging the

310
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,200
air and oftentimes I'm just opening up

311
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,260
the grow tent and then waving The Grow

312
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,480
Tent flap so air is being moved around

313
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,159
being exhausted out of there that way

314
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,440
real quick and then I always have to add

315
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,059
in a humidifier to increase the humidity

316
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,140
I know some people run a dehumidifier

317
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,639
but these days I haven't really been

318
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,500
doing drying that way now that I have

319
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,778
the cannot roll so you guys can see that

320
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,458
in the background right there can a

321
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,039
troll big shout out to them their

322
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:29,399
machine is awesome in my opinion makes a

323
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,500
drying process hands off really just uh

324
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,958
harvest the plant cut the individual

325
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,958
branches so they'll fit into the Kenneth

326
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,759
troll boom boom boom on and then after

327
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,899
the first day you wet the sponge and put

328
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,819
it in there it helps regulate the

329
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,679
humidity in the in the space and then

330
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,540
the drip pan on the book on the back you

331
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,000
have to make sure that gets emptied I

332
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,278
only had to empty it I think twice when

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,019
I was drying and um that has been

334
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,519
working out fantastic I'll definitely

335
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,200
put a link in the YouTube description

336
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,519
section below if you want to learn more

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,899
about the can of troll it's a new

338
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,778
technology you know a lot of people have

339
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,458
been asking about the review video I'm

340
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,860
working on that I should have that out

341
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,899
in the upcoming weeks if all goes good I

342
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,759
know they have been sold out for quite

343
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,919
some time they're still taking orders

344
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,200
just on back order it's probably a

345
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,819
better way to say it yeah that's hot

346
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,980
product and I hope to have that review

347
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,180
video soon for you but yeah I would

348
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,360
always use the oscillating fan on the

349
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,679
dry tap not just an inline fan but there

350
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,220
are different ways to go about it of

351
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:29,458
course is Fox Farm ocean Force mixed two

352
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,759
hot for Autos hasn't been hot for me and

353
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,379
now that's all you see in videos these

354
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,240
days for random people that just say

355
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,860
it's too hot it's never been hot for me

356
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,500
for 13 years I've been running Foxfire

357
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,139
motion for a soil for autos and for

358
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,899
photos I've had like one plant two

359
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,278
plants that actually like had issues

360
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,500
with it where it looked like it was just

361
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,720
kind of toxic with nitrogen and there I

362
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,639
feel like it's just uh it's the cultivar

363
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,100
in that case doing it not so much the

364
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,079
soil so I've always had good luck with

365
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,000
fox farm oceanforce so I really really

366
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,000
like that mix I have it in my local

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,820
Nursery down the street so I tend to go

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,740
after that if I need bagged soil like

369
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,540
that so I would say no that's not too

370
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,399
hot for Autos but I would like to know

371
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:15,179
in the comments section below if anybody

372
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,039
out there has had too hot of soil for

373
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,120
Autos particularly the fox promotion

374
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,860
Force soil let me know down in the

375
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,000
comments it'd be interesting to see if

376
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,000
anybody speaks up on that one
