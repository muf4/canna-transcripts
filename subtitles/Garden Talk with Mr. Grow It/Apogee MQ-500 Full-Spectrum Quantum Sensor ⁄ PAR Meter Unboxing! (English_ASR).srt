1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
what is up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,720
know me my name is mr growit in this

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,480
video i'm going to unbox the apogee

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:11,120
mq-500 quantum sensor when growing

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,199
cannabis this quantum sensor or often

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,199
referred to as par meter is used to

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,118
measure photon density

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,038
this is the amount of par or

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,439
photosynthetic active radiation the

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,840
energy that plants use of photosynthesis

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,679
that's being emitted from the grow light

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,640
this sensor picks up all light in the

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,039
400 to 700 nanometer range

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,039
okay let's get into the unboxing this is

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
the shipping box and as you can see when

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,558
opening it's packed nicely with some

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
bubble wrap

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,399
there is a small piece of paper in there

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
which thanks me for ordering and tells

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,960
me to go to the website for additional

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
information

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
the quantum sensor comes in this

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,679
carrying case

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,280
and then when i open the case it's

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,280
completely padded for protection

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
here is the quantum sensor it comes with

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,280
a two meter cable and i'm just pulling

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,439
off the plastic material right now and

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
the cord comes zip tied as well so i had

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
to cut that off

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,359
there's a cap on top of the actual

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
sensor for protection and i bought the

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,799
wand as well this was an additional cost

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,759
it does not come with the mq 500

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,200
the one extends to 84 centimeters

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
and you can just pull it out and that's

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,759
how it extends so

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,320
no release button or anything like that

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,719
it comes with a few velcro pieces and

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,639
then lastly it comes with a battery

41
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,438
this battery will of course need to be

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,040
put into the sensor before operating and

43
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,519
i'll do that in a minute

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,200
now first i'm going to attach the wand

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,759
i need to unscrew the screw that's in

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,759
the bottom of the sensor

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,719
and now i'll attach the top of the wand

48
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,039
to the sensor and then screw the screw

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,280
back on

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
next i'll remove the back plate and add

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,159
in the battery

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
and the battery just slides right in

53
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,920
and then after i reattach the back plate

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,680
the quantum sensor is ready to use

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
since this sensor doesn't come with an

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
instruction manual i highly recommend

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,519
that you watch the instructional video

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
that apogee created i'll leave a link to

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
that video in the description section

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
below along with a link to the mq 500

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
quantum sensor that's pretty much it for

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,878
this video guys if you enjoyed it please

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,199
click that thumbs up and i will leave it

64
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,639
at that thank you so much for watching

65
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,639
and until next time peace
