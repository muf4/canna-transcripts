00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,688
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,338
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,638
you'll watch a mattress channel here I

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,380
have the spider farmer sf4 thousand LED

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,119
grow light spider farmer sent me this

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,460
grow light to test out and I figured I

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,259
would do this unboxing and also test the

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,969
power output I'm not gonna go over all

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,830
of the grow lights features in this

10
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,269
video but it will leave a link to this

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,979
grow light in the description section

12
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,868
below so you can click on that link to

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,028
learn more about this girl light they've

14
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,820
also provided me a coupon for my viewers

15
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:35,308
you can use code mister Grodd 5 on

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,259
Amazon USA Amazon CA de or Amazon UK for

17
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,078
the part test I'm gonna use the app og

18
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:43,649
MQ 500 power meter this meter measures

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,140
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,329
plus or minus 5 nanometers and the

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,679
measurements are in ppfd if there's any

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,000
light being emitted outside of that

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,189
range it's not going to show on this

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,170
meter okay first thing out the box

25
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,628
they've included some Garden tags

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,239
there's a few different colors here here

27
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:02,460
is a wire hanging kit and two rope

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,618
ratchet hangers the power cord is

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,728
already attached to the drivers they use

30
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,319
two drivers the meanwhile LG 240 they've

31
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,989
included some measuring tape so you can

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,109
measure out the light distance a thank

33
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:18,599
you card and the SF series grow lights

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,700
user manual this LED grill that has a

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,039
flowering coverage area of five foot by

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,409
five foot although many growers say that

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,210
this is overstated a little bit and it

38
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,549
said that a full foot by four foot grow

39
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,109
space is a better fit I'm gonna hang the

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,210
grow light in a four foot by four foot

41
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,578
grow tent and I'll take measurements at

42
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,319
four different distances which are the

43
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,109
distances that they recommend in their

44
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,750
user manual 30 inches away 24 inches

45
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,879
away 18 inches away and 12 inches away

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,250
if this is your first time watching one

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,509
of my part test videos I do this just to

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,489
give you a general idea of what the

49
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,500
power output is not everybody has a

50
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,269
power meter so they can't check and see

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,469
these numbers themselves so this isn't

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,989
going to be a hundred percent accurate

53
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,298
test also the reflective walls on the

54
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,459
grow tent could increase the numbers so

55
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,079
just keep that in mind last thing to

56
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,718
look at before we get into the

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,699
measurements is the wattage pull my

58
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,590
kilowatt meter shows three point six

59
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,649
eight amps pulling the four hundred and

60
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,729
forty three watts from the wall

61
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,219
all right let's get into the

62
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:42,008
measurements

63
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:42,009
