docomo is on pre-order until October

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,799
15th I'll leave a link down in the

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,039
YouTube description section below if

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,839
anyone wants to learn more about it M's

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,280
got a strain that turns purple near the

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,239
end of flower but in current Cycles the

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,960
leaves have been turning crispy crumbly

19
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,558
on the pl s have changing color any

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,320
thoughts on why it's cocoa perlite and

21
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:49,399
synthetic nutrients is it just the top

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,759
part of the plant could be potential

23
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,320
light bur that's something that have

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,920
come across in the past and I think a

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,600
lot of people commonly come across that

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,679
now since roay technology has just

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
gotten so crazy over the years more and

28
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,118
more not only efficiency but powerful

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,640
lights people run them too close dimmer

30
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,438
all the way full blast and they're just

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,040
burning the crap out of their plants so

32
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:11,719
if you're seeing that crispiness happen

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,439
towards the top of the plant starting at

34
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,039
the top of the plant and working its way

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,559
down that's very well could be too much

36
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,000
light there now you can do either two

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,960
things you know increase the light

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
distance so there's less light or some

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,239
people will try to make more ideal

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,319
conditions where there be adjustments to

41
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,959
like a higher temperature a little bit

42
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,000
higher of attemp 85 degre fenhe upwards

43
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,239
of 87 degrees fah typically making sure

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,799
your humidity is dialed in so your VPD

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,158
is dialed in CO2 supplementing CO2 and

46
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,200
then of course having the nutrition you

47
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,359
need so higher EC in the medium and then

48
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,519
you can take in more light so those are

49
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,478
the things that kind of come off to the

50
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,039
mind right off the bat just by what

51
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,438
you're explaining but of course it's

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,159
there's so many variables with this that

53
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,959
uh could certainly be something else so

54
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,840
hopefully that helps does Humidity that

55
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,319
changes up and down 55 to 70% 10 minutes

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,359
stress the plants out congrats on baby

57
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,919
appreciate you uh that's a good question

58
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,280
you know I've had many many grows in the

59
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,400
past where I just had an unreliable

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,878
humidifier I live in a very dry climate

61
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,840
got to say that in every episode very

62
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,280
dry climate here it's about 30% R where

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,519
I live so I'm always increasing humidity

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,560
I've had many humidifiers in the past

65
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,959
all different brands and some of them

66
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,479
unfortunately I've had the same swing

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,959
that you've had 55 up to 70 you know

68
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,878
even if I've set that humidifier to 60%

69
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,959
65% whatever I want you still get that

70
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,439
swing and that's why I went through the

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
same exact thing as you and grew the

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,680
plant successfully now whether or not

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,680
that stresses them out to the fact that

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,239
it's going to be a negative impact some

75
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,920
may say it may cause hermaphrodite to

76
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,878
happen in the plant I can't confirm that

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,919
I personally haven't come across that

78
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,399
and I don't think there's been any

79
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,399
studies in regards to that but yeah the

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,280
stata opening is going to obviously

81
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,280
change right so the intake of CO2 is

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,039
going to be imp imped with the the up

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,598
and downs so there certainly will be

84
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,639
kind of a negative impact having that

85
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,798
swing but uh you're still going to get a

86
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,359
plant that grows it could still be

87
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,280
healthy you'll still get to harvest and

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,760
uh you can still be successful so if you

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
are in that situation to where things

90
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,239
are swinging back and forth like that

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,959
for you go ahead and try to continue to

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,759
stabilize things that would be better

93
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,759
but uh I wouldn't panic because uh yeah

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,399
I've been there been there done that and

95
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,919
still got to harvest have some seed

96
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,640
things that are in Cocoa when would you

97
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,518
think or Rec and it would be okay to

98
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,878
start tach pun immediately so you can do

99
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,519
it right away straight from the

100
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,438
scientist's mouth George Mario will give

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,200
him a shout out he says as early as

102
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,519
possible so they can give their first

103
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,438
dose as a Seedling some folks are even

104
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,519
mixing in stash blend in the media to

105
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,000
begin before they even plant in and

106
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,438
that's a good way to start the micro

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,479
isal fungi Colony I've been using yucka

108
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,359
every third watering can use every

109
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,719
watering I did haven't used yaka in a

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
little while though I haven't really had

111
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,799
the need to I usually use it when uh my

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,158
soul gets just super dry sometimes

113
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,799
between grows the so the soil will dry

114
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,959
out a little bit so I'll go in and use

115
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,599
yucka but I used to use every watering I

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,759
used every other so I've done a whole

117
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:14,318
bunch of things and uh yeah it's

118
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,399
perfectly fine to use the only thing it

119
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,319
may hurt is your wallet you know if

120
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,719
you're spending money on it and you're

121
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,120
doing it you know you're going to use up

122
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,360
more and you're going to need to buy it

123
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,918
more often so that's really uh as far as

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,520
I can see the only harm it'll do is on

125
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,439
your wallet can yuck could be using a

126
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,959
blue M absolutely yep I've been using it

127
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,879
blue blue matte res no problem doesn't

128
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,799
like Gunk up the drip lines or anything

129
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,240
like that what company do you use to sex

130
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,560
your plant I use farmer Freeman so I had

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
a partnership with him for many many

132
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,079
years now and he offers my audience a

133
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,120
discount so big shout out to him

134
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,879
discount code Mr Grow it pretty fast

135
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,000
turn around so once they receive it it's

136
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,079
uh within 48 hours I think is usually

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
within 24 hours but sometimes within 48

138
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,079
hours I'll get the results do you ever

139
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,478
test for hlvd yes I did do one test in

140
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,079
particular for a plant that I had I

141
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,879
actually have a video in the works I

142
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,439
have so many videos in the works and I'm

143
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,560
dying to get this thing out where this

144
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,038
plant I I'm looking at it and showing

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,478
all the symptoms well not all the

146
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,918
symptoms but showing a lot of symptoms

147
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,439
of hopl and vroid so I take the samples

148
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,198
send it out for testing and then I get

149
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,560
the samples back and U I'm working on a

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,280
video so I'm not going to really tell

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,439
you what the result is on it I don't

152
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,879
want to spoil it for you but yes I have

153
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,839
done testing particularly through farmer

154
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,600
Freeman is Fox telling stress does it

155
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,959
reduce yield that's a good question I

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,000
think some people will say it is stress

157
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,599
right too much heat can is a form of

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,879
stress and it can cause Fox tailing now

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,479
Fox tailing is within some genetics

160
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,038
there's some genetics that they Fox down

161
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,279
no matter what no matter what the

162
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,560
temperature is but in most cases it's

163
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,638
usually high temp at least in my

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,639
experience then I get the fox Talon come

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,319
out I good example of this is I grow

166
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,160
curb stomper couple different times

167
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,360
first time I grew it out my temps were

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,199
under control no problem second time I

169
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,879
grew it out a little bit more sensitive

170
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,240
ended up Fox tailing now it didn't

171
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,680
destroy the buds like there was I guess

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,000
there's different levels of fox tailing

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,519
right you could just get a couple fox

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,038
tails come out of it or you get the

175
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,198
whole bud have fox tail come out at all

176
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,839
different angles and I still had dense

177
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,080
bud structure with fox tails quality was

178
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,638
still there and TPS was still there and

179
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,758
all that stuff as far as reducing yield

180
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,759
I would say no I don't think it does any

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,960
reduction in yield some may say it

182
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,120
actually increases yield I could see

183
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,120
somebody saying that since there's more

184
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,280
Bud development happening during that so

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,038
I think it's a really good question

186
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,198
though recommendation for an organic dry

187
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,680
Amendment nutrient line I used to use

188
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,840
Earth dust nutrients by the green

189
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,439
Sunshine Company and I had some good

190
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,198
success once I figured how to use them

191
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,399
at first I wasn't uh keeping the medium

192
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,919
moist enough and uh as as many of you

193
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,598
know when you're growing organically

194
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,598
keeping the med moist at all times is

195
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,319
important so the amendment can break

196
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,918
down and be turned into usable nutrients

197
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,759
for the plant so Earth dust

198
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,719
unfortunately that company went under

199
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,759
that was a green Sunshine Company that's

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,319
no longer being sold I went over to

201
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,800
craft blend by buildo soil great success

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,080
with them several years I've been

203
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,439
running craft blend for so easy to use

204
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,560
all I did was one cup per a plant now

205
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,000
that was back when I was using seven

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,439
gallon containers so what I would do is

207
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,120
amend the soil begin with one cup then

208
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:35,319
every 30 days from there do a top

209
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,598
dressing right so 30 days into veg which

210
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,479
usually for me since I'm throwing small

211
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,439
to mediumsized plants 30 days in veg is

212
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,478
right before flipping the flower I'll

213
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,319
hit it with a top dressing one cup per

214
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,279
plant then every than 30 days into flour

215
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,560
then if I'm growing a longer flower in

216
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,719
cultivar something that's like uh 11 12

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
13 weaker I'll hit it again at day 60 or

218
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,960
so with another top dressing but if it's

219
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
an eight weaker nine weer I'll just do

220
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,598
that one top dress and get day 30 and

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,918
that's it so initial amending right

222
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,719
before flipping the flower which is

223
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,318
usually around day 30 or 40 a veg for me

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
then 30 days into flower and that's it

225
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,720
now I've done experiments to where I do

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,439
every 15 days instead of every 30 days

227
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,919
every 20 days instead of every 30 days

228
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,800
every 40 days instead of every 30 days

229
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,918
I've gotten some mixed results there for

230
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
the most part every 30 days has worked

231
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:30,240
for me in particular same exact thing

232
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
with Tad hussy's kiss organic

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,120
so that's something I've used my last

234
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
grow for the first time kiss Organics

235
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,240
nutrient pack the nutrient pack as well

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,679
as a craft blend is just a onep parter

237
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,479
so that makes things so much easier it

238
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,559
doesn't have a a it's not a formula for

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,680
veg and then a separate formula for

240
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,079
Bloom it's just one that you feed

241
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,679
throughout which makes things so much

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,560
easier so craft blend is like that Tad

243
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:56,519
hussies kiss Organics nutrient pack is

244
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,039
like that as well great great success

245
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,879
with that as well I recommend it and I'm

246
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,199
going to going to continue to use it so

247
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,838
those are two organic dry nutrient lines

248
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
that I can recommend is there really

249
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,000
much of a difference with new lights

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,240
other than the best efficiency I'm not

251
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,399
sure what you mean by the second part of

252
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,680
the question there but I'll answer the

253
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,159
first part of the question which is is

254
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,000
there mustard of a difference with these

255
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,319
new lights H not really you know in my

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,519
opinion and we're actually going to do a

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,760
full from the stash podcast episode on

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,720
this so me Rob hens 420 we're all going

259
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,879
to talk about this topic in particular

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,759
grow light technology and how it's kind

261
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:34,439
of flat lined it hasn't really changed a

262
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,480
whole lot in the past couple years

263
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,279
little bit more efficiency right but as

264
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,639
far as light spread across the canopy a

265
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,200
lot of these lights are going to achieve

266
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,360
the same thing similar results a lot of

267
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,480
folks right now what they're going what

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,079
they're doing is they're just going

269
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,200
after the cheapest light you know so if

270
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,958
they have you see Infinity spider farmer

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,879
Mars Hydro in mind that to toss up

272
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,278
between those three they're really just

273
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,759
going with what the cheapest one is

274
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,399
because they're all similar light spread

275
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,879
similar SAR efficiency similar power

276
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,958
output yeah these days it's grow light

277
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,078
technology has kind of got a little

278
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,799
boring at least to me everything is so

279
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,120
similar you know there's not much

280
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,399
advancements going on biggest advant

281
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,839
advancement that's happened at grite

282
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,879
technology this year has been the Evo

283
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,959
diode a little bit more efficient love

284
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,958
the question and uh we'll have a full

285
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,879
length podcast episode on from the sash

286
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,319
at some point in the future from Hawaii

287
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,200
is 60 to 70% humidity too much for the

288
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,200
plants nope not at all and uh if you

289
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,000
look at the VPD chart not sure if you're

290
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,278
familiar with VPD or not Google it there

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,440
actually a couple different charts out

292
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:41,799
there I go with the pulse VPD charts so

293
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,120
if you search pulse VPD chart uh you

294
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,799
should see three different charts one is

295
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,200
going to be for seedlings one is going

296
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,838
to be for flowering and then one is

297
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,879
going to be for veg actually the

298
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,160
seedlings is also seedling clones and uh

299
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,799
you'll see that you can totally get away

300
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,519
with 60 70% humidity you'll just have to

301
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,719
run a little bit higher of temps it

302
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
depends on which stage of growth you're

303
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,278
in so it's kind of hard for me to to

304
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,240
talk about it but 60 70% even through

305
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,759
flowering I've gotten away with it the

306
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,600
biggest concern for that is Bud rot in

307
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,120
particular and then if you're in veg

308
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,200
biggest concern for high humidity is

309
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,959
powdery mildew so um real good air

310
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,360
circulation in there making sure things

311
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,159
are moving around the air is moving

312
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,278
around that's going to help prevent

313
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,519
potery mildew and Bud rot and of course

314
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,679
making sure that uh your canopy isn't

315
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,480
too thick liquid leaves so air flow can

316
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,319
get in there those are some things that

317
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,039
if you are running up humidity in that

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
range keep an eye out for and you should

319
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,958
be fine is there a need for your plants

320
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
to fade at the end of flow some plants

321
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,599
are going to naturally fade at the end

322
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,480
no matter what you feed nutrients all

323
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,079
the way up until the end you won't you

324
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,278
might not get a fade at all sometimes

325
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,879
you'll feed out nutrients all the way up

326
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:53,360
to end and you'll get a fade okay some

327
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,519
people flush you know whether or not you

328
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,600
believe in Flushing that can help bring

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,278
out a fade do you need a fade at the end

330
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,278
of the five FL no you don't need it in

331
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,720
fact I got a couple cultivars right now

332
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,919
that aren't fading at all you know I'm

333
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,440
going to be harvesting them within uh

334
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,319
they're actually day 45 they look like

335
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,839
they're going to go another week no

336
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,600
another two weeks maybe a Max no fade

337
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,120
happening on them whatsoever so um as

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,560
far as a need to fade no that's a

339
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,519
mistake I think a lot of new Growers

340
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,000
make is they think that the fade has to

341
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
happen you know and they Panic you know

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,278
they get up to what they think is

343
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,879
Harvest and they don't see a fade on

344
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:33,320
their plants and then St flush and then

345
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,799
uh all of a sudden buds are overripe

346
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,760
bananas start coming out pollinating the

347
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,919
other plants that are around so like

348
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,720
pushing your plants longer than normal

349
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,759
because you're not getting a fade watch

350
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,920
out for that because I've had that

351
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
happen to me before actually back in the

352
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,198
day I thought that you needed that fade

353
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,240
you know Once Upon a Time many years ago

354
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,639
I thought that every plant needed a fade

355
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
and that's just not correct at all um I

356
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,959
had plants that unfortunately nanner

357
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
started popping out pollinated all the

358
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,799
plants that were in the tent I had some

359
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,480
PLS that were early flowering those got

360
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:08,000
pollinated so no bueno long story short

361
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,399
no excess time flowering causes poor

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,159
buds Bro Science readit somewhere if yes

363
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,919
is it hard to control no that's that's

364
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:21,360
grow science that's not Bro Science yeah

365
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,159
excess nitrogen flowering can cause AER

366
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,800
buds it can cause you'll get like a a

367
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,039
growth spurt happening uh weeks 2 three

368
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,359
and Beyond you'll see like the top of

369
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,399
the plants will kind of grow even more

370
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,600
I've ruined crops because of excess

371
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,759
nitrogen I've told this story before but

372
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,920
I had 4x4 tent full of blueberry overfed

373
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,319
nitrogen toxicity I thought everything

374
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,319
was good this was way back way way back

375
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,120
and overfed them got into week four or

376
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,800
five flowering I'm like these bu don't

377
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,759
look right they're like really Airy it

378
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,758
doesn't look like any of my past grows

379
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,278
and come to find out it was me just

380
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,720
overfeeding too much nitrogen and

381
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,399
flowering one of the things that was a

382
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,639
contributing factor was Cal Mag calmag

383
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,039
along with my base nutrients calmag has

384
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,240
most calmag has nitrogen in it as well

385
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,639
so it's not just your calcium magnesium

386
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,198
some have nitrogen in it some have iron

387
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,720
in it as well so really got to be

388
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,359
careful on that I've made that mistake

389
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,160
in the past I know people still make

390
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,278
that mistake today you could certainly

391
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,759
get poor buds in flowering due to excess

392
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,679
nitrogen absolutely if yes this is hard

393
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,039
to control in Organics yeah it's not as

394
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,758
common like I don't really get uh you

395
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,159
know I'll get some darker leaves that

396
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,278
seems like it's like on the verge of

397
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,120
nitrogen toxicity but I've never had

398
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,600
like bad bud structure due to too much

399
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,519
nitrogen uh when I'm giving organic

400
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,920
fertilizers but you can absolutely

401
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,919
overdo organic fertilizers no question

402
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,198
have you seen the autopot tray yet

403
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,399
really want a few with aggressive fabric

404
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,078
I did see that yes H I'm anxious to get

405
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,839
one too um I wonder what the size is I

406
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,559
didn't see what the dimensions were like

407
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,920
how big of a bed it actually is is but

408
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,599
that looks like it's going to be really

409
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,039
cool I want to get my hands on that and

410
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,879
try it how was your honest experience in

411
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:12,120
Dr bug's class fantastic I did it two

412
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,799
years in a row if he continues it I will

413
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,959
continue to do it so for those that

414
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,838
don't know Dr Bruce bugby over at Utah

415
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,559
State University he has a course every

416
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,440
fall he's been doing the past couple

417
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,078
years first it was like 40 different

418
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,680
presentations I think now there's well

419
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,159
over 60 I believe don't quote me on that

420
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,879
but there's a ton T of different

421
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,759
presentations on all aspects of

422
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,318
cultivation and I loved it for beginners

423
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,560
I think it's a little bit too advanced

424
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,919
it's real deep into the science I

425
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,958
imagine this going over a lot of

426
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,799
people's heads the course isn't active

427
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,159
right now as or actually it might be

428
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,519
we're in October now did he activate

429
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,719
again cuz I need to sign up if he

430
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,679
activated that again usually he

431
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
activates it in September I believe but

432
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,078
I would recommend it for those that are

433
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,318
intermediate or Advance if you're a

434
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,638
beginner it might go over your head

435
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,599
might want to learn the barebone basics

436
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,519
to begin and then if you really want to

437
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Advanced things definitely take that

438
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,720
course I highly recommend it is that you

439
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,000
get a cannabis cultivation certificate

440
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,560
from Utah City University and I uh I

441
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,440
passed and I have it so definitely

442
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,000
definitely uh recommend that what is

443
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,160
considered a successful grow I like this

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
question I think success is different

445
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,000
for everybody I think for some people

446
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,839
just getting to harvest is a success

447
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
right because there were so many things

448
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,720
that could go wrong throughout the grow

449
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
right you could get past infestation and

450
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,399
then have to wipe all your grow because

451
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,519
of that cuz it's just so much out of

452
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,039
control you could just have a lack of

453
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,278
nutrition and your plants could just be

454
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,000
dying out and you want to start over so

455
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,159
not successful there right so I think

456
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,799
for a lot of people just getting to

457
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,958
harvest especially with the new Growers

458
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,278
I know when I first started growing I

459
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,679
just wanted to get to harvest if there

460
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,078
was some yellow leaves on there by

461
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,599
Harvest whatever you know as long as I

462
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,159
was able to get some buds to smoke at

463
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,440
the end right but my definition of a

464
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,318
successful Harvest is a plant that is

465
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,160
healthy throughout the entire growth and

466
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,159
and getting to harvest as well pretty

467
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,600
short answer on that one but what's your

468
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,918
definition of a successful grow I would

469
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,679
love to know that in the comment section

470
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,600
below because I think it's for everybody

471
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,959
different I feel like we're going to get

472
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,000
a lot of different responses on this one

473
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,600
I know some people uh have a feeling are

474
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,959
going to mention flavor I think they're

475
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,798
going to mention the uh canabo content

476
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,279
things like that that would be

477
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:21,798
considered successful if they got what

478
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,639
they were looking for but yeah I think

479
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:26,720
it's different for everybody that's a

480
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,720
really good question
