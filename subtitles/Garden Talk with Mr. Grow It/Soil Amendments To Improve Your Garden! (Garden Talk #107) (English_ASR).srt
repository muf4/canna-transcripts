in this episode he talks about several

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,659
different Garden amendments why they

19
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,819
would be applied and the pros and cons

20
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,099
of using them there is now a separate

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,899
Channel called Garden talk clips on

first time around was episode 16 back in

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,920
May of 2021 so quite a while ago you

68
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,439
talked all about utilizing

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,299
microorganisms in the guard and uh there

70
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,719
was so much great information in that

71
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,019
episode and it got over 63 000 listens

72
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,759
on YouTube alone so that's nuts you've

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,400
definitely touched a lot of lives in

74
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,500
that episode in this episode we're going

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,379
to get into various Garden amendments

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,419
why they would be applied and the pros

77
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:57,060
and cons of using them so really excited

78
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,439
for this one but first can you introduce

79
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,840
yourself for those that didn't catch the

80
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,939
first episode we did together sure for

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,920
any of your listen listeners who aren't

82
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,878
familiar with myself my name is Brandon

83
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,818
rust

84
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:12,539
um I specialize in Agronomy and

85
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,579
microbiology for medicinal plants but I

86
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,519
also you know work with people who do

87
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,440
food production and all you know all

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
types of other types of agricultural

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,699
crops

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,319
um I own bokashi Earthworks and we have

91
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,299
a couple of different things that we do

92
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,479
at focashi Earthworks so one of the

93
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,239
things that we've that we are ramping up

94
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:35,280
and starting to do on a larger scale is

95
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,140
our green waste recycling program where

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,680
we take organic waste from other

97
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,259
Industries and we convert those into uh

98
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,840
biological fertilizers through a process

99
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,340
of solid state fermentation we might

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080
have touched a little bit about that on

101
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,620
the last episode

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,099
that we did together we also manufacture

103
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,379
a product called micro plus here in

104
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,139
Oklahoma City

105
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,780
um at the office

106
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:06,000
and that is a Consortium of

107
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,878
microorganisms fungus yeast and bacteria

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,158
that is used for bioremediation for

109
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,859
nutrient cycling pathogen suppression

110
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:17,219
has a bunch of different applications in

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,280
across agriculture remediation and even

112
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,860
it is used in livestock industry as well

113
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,059
as a probiotic

114
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,400
um and then we also sell uh bulk soils

115
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,780
amendments and humate fertilizers that

116
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,399
were developed by NASA agricultural

117
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,079
Technologies

118
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,599
and so we have a lot of different

119
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,359
aspects we just opened up our bokashi

120
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,540
Earthworks Learning Center where you can

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,100
actually come in person on our scheduled

122
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,139
days and you can learn about different

123
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,580
subjects similar to what we're doing now

124
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,478
while we're doing

125
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,599
um we're going to be talking about

126
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,779
organic amendments we have classes on

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,639
solid state fermentation different

128
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:01,619
practical applications uh of you know

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,060
microorganisms in gardening so we have a

130
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,879
lot of different things that we cover

131
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,978
and we'll be making more schedules and

132
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,639
more events as the year progresses we'll

133
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:14,039
also have guest speakers such as Dr

134
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,620
Pepper Hernandez and some other people

135
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,600
doing some knf classes as well some

136
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,459
natural farming classes

137
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,220
so we kind of bundled everything

138
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,079
together because I the biggest hurdle

139
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,600
that I found when it comes to breaking

140
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,019
into conventional agriculture is the

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,780
education is is greatly needed uh before

142
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,060
people will put their faith in doing

143
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,339
something new especially when it comes

144
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,139
to you know when we're talking about the

145
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,119
American Farmer one of the things that a

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,620
lot of times they face is the fact that

147
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,720
a lot of these people are actually

148
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,660
mortgaging their land and their property

149
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,639
to get the things that they need to be

150
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,100
successful and so they always typically

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,900
go with what has worked in the past and

152
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,419
they that's been replicatable because

153
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,159
their livelihoods are on their line on

154
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,978
the line and if something goes wrong

155
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,020
they could be out everything

156
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,360
um their whole family their whole their

157
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,279
family's livelihood and their business

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,020
and everything so

159
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,939
it's one of the things that a lot of

160
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,538
people don't understand about how you

161
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:19,079
know American agriculture works but

162
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:20,699
they they do a lot of uh labor not a

163
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,379
great return and a lot of times they're

164
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,080
putting everything on the line to do it

165
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,159
so we have to make sure that the people

166
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,079
who are

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
switching over these types of programs

168
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,800
really understand

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,900
the way that they operate and the

170
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,100
practical application that's behind the

171
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,019
science

172
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,939
so that way they can achieve the success

173
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,519
that they need to be profitable and

174
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,500
maintain a sustainable agricultural

175
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,959
model I like that you not only have good

176
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,180
products but a big focus of yours is the

177
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,918
education you know you're not shy and

178
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,439
holding back information right you're

179
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,299
trying to educate the community and

180
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,579
that's a big deal you know not a lot of

181
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,600
people will be open to that you know

182
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,859
they just want to sell their products

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,180
and that's it they don't really care

184
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,800
about the education side of things I

185
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,900
mean just going on your Instagram alone

186
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,160
I know before we start recording you I'd

187
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,599
mention that you're not able to really

188
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,120
keep up with as much as you like but

189
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,520
there's a lot of great information in

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
regards to the science behind the plant

191
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,299
and things that can be useful in the

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,860
garden in order to grow these plants

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,478
successfully so I'll definitely have a

194
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,979
link to his Instagram down in the

195
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,598
YouTube description section below for

196
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:22,978
those of you tuning in on YouTube highly

197
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,360
recommend you give him a follow because

198
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:26,399
there's great information on that

199
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,720
channel alright so getting into the

200
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,839
topic so you gave me a list of

201
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,819
amendments prior to recording here I

202
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,079
want to ask to begin are all these

203
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,919
amendments that you're about to talk to

204
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:41,339
organic or are some synthetic okay so

205
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,459
let's talk about what organic is first

206
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,959
of all because there's uh some

207
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:49,379
misunderstandings about organic versus

208
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,899
synthetic so you could have and and also

209
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,719
natural

210
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:57,239
so in most people's minds when they hear

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,000
organic they are thinking about a

212
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,120
practice you know using things that are

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,639
naturally uh around them things that are

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,079
sustainable and that I consider you know

215
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,598
uh

216
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,818
natural farming

217
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,918
where you're using where everything is

218
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,319
pretty much organic but here's the thing

219
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,258
what organic truly means is carbon based

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,098
so if you were to approach any any

221
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,860
institution any type of scientist or

222
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:29,339
anything else and you're talking about

223
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,439
organic it means that it is carbon based

224
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,899
now some of the things that we use in

225
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,179
agriculture don't contain carbon but

226
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,639
they are natural things like gypsum for

227
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,778
instance which is calcium calcium

228
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,000
sulfate

229
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,979
now it's a natural component comes right

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,299
out of the earth there's an abundance of

231
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,120
it

232
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:51,359
it's it's easily accessible and it

233
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,899
doesn't have any negative impacts on the

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,419
environment when it's applied correctly

235
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,860
it you know even in and also I want to

236
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,979
make sure people understand just because

237
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,620
something is is considered organic

238
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,440
doesn't necessarily mean safe either

239
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,299
because there are things that are

240
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,140
organic that are also

241
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,958
um

242
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,879
they're not safe you know or if you're

243
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,500
over applying something it can still

244
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,320
have a detrimental impact to the

245
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,958
environment or people around you

246
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,379
and so when we're talking about organic

247
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:28,439
in this context we're talking about

248
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:30,299
both meals those are usually organic

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,700
inputs and then you have things that are

250
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:37,199
natural like your rock minerals and then

251
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:41,278
you also have natural salts like Epsom

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,180
salt that is a natural occurring mineral

253
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,100
and it is assault and what assault is

254
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,199
it's just a it's a cation an element

255
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,899
with a negative with a positive charge

256
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,339
attached to an anion which is an element

257
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,440
with a negative charge and what happens

258
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,180
is it just means that negative and

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,220
positive attract and so they they've

260
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,979
attracted they've created a covalent

261
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,600
bond it's not a very strong bond and so

262
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,820
they disassociate in the presence of

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,759
water and so when we're looking at

264
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,399
something like gypsum or copper sulfate

265
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,500
or iron sulfate there's these things are

266
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,899
natural they come from the ground they

267
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,419
are not synthetically produced so the

268
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,519
difference between organic and natural

269
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,479
so we're using things at organic and

270
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,860
natural

271
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,360
we're not using things that are

272
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,820
synthetically created

273
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,100
right like

274
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,260
um that come from the Herbert botch

275
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,759
process of creating nitrogen from from

276
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,879
gas

277
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,159
right so there's just and then you know

278
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,659
some of the synthetics

279
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,699
if you were to talk about like dap

280
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,639
diamonium phosphate right you're

281
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,560
essentially mixing uh ammonium and

282
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,019
phosphate and what the way that that

283
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,659
would work is you would take a natural

284
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,940
mineral element that contains phosphorus

285
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,159
you're attacking that parent appetite

286
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,680
material with something like phosph uh

287
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,379
like with a sulfuric acid and what that

288
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,419
does is it releases the anion that we

289
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,639
were mentioning that phosphorus anion

290
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,199
from that parent appetite material

291
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,360
liberates that and they're able to

292
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,459
separate that out now they take that

293
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
phosphorus and then they mix that with

294
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,379
the ammonium that was made during the

295
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,778
Herbert process and they get you know

296
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:22,200
monoammonium or diamonium phosphate

297
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:24,360
now those things take a lot of energy

298
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,339
and resources to produce that's why

299
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,139
we're looking at these and going hey

300
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,779
this is may not be the best way to do it

301
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,699
because of the the resources allocated

302
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:36,659
to the production of those things

303
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:39,060
they're not in and also

304
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,259
like if they're used properly or if

305
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,899
they're

306
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:46,259
you know they have less of a detrimental

307
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:50,039
impact right and so

308
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,958
the but the problem is that even when

309
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,360
you create something like diamonium

310
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,639
phosphate which has really high nitrogen

311
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,159
value and a really high phosphorus value

312
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,159
those things are both biologically

313
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,539
mediated right naturally in systems and

314
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,159
so

315
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:06,480
as soon as you put that down you're

316
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,120
going to lose nitrogen immediately

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,060
because it volatile it it goes through a

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,459
process of that is mediated by biology

319
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:17,219
and some of that can off gas back into

320
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:19,799
the atmosphere as atmospheric nitrogen

321
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,620
some of it will be leached away it's got

322
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,539
a very low nutrient use efficiency so

323
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,879
even though you're putting High numbers

324
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:28,919
on there maybe like 42 percent uh

325
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,958
phosphorus in this case

326
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,059
not all of that is going to be available

327
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,179
what happens is as soon as that is

328
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,838
liberated both of that that cation from

329
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:42,299
the ammonium and that anion from the

330
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,639
phosphorus those are liberated and so

331
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,458
now you have a highly highly reactive

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,500
anion that doesn't stay in that form

333
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:52,138
freely in nature for very long and so

334
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,720
what it does is it's it attaches to

335
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,220
other uh positively charged particles in

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,740
the soil and so it can tie up things

337
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,800
like iron and calcium and zinc and

338
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,360
manganese it can tie up

339
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,939
these these other elements making them

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,919
unavailable the plan and so you're

341
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,779
essentially the thinking is oh I'm

342
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,219
adding in a bunch of this mineral

343
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,778
nutrient but what you're actually doing

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,459
is you're causing a chemical reaction

345
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,679
when those things disassociated or

346
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,958
liberated within that system where they

347
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,879
start to tie up other things making the

348
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,119
things that were already there that were

349
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,799
available become unavailable and so

350
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,839
there's a bunch of chemical reactions

351
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,539
that are happening and there are

352
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,079
biological reactions that are mediated

353
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:36,719
during these processes you know Carbon

354
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:38,759
phosphorus sulfur nitrogen and iron are

355
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,519
all very very highly biologically

356
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,078
mediated in these soil systems and so we

357
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,179
have the nitrogen cycle we have the

358
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:47,278
phosphorus cycle we have the carbon and

359
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,559
sulfur cycles and then iron is a whole

360
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,500
different beast in itself when we're

361
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:56,399
talking about the natural acquisition of

362
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:01,679
iron into the plant is because iron you

363
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,200
know it it oxidizes so rapidly in in

364
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,838
you know the pH ranges that these plants

365
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,339
are usually optimally operating in and

366
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,800
then also in the presence of water

367
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,220
because it's it's Ox the water is an

368
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,620
oxidizing agent and so it it gives off

369
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,278
its hydrogen ions to that ferric iron

370
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,019
and cause and causes it to oxidize into

371
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,879
fe3 plus which isn't really available to

372
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,879
a lot of plants

373
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,278
and so with Biology you can have things

374
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,740
like the the production of amino acids

375
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,200
and sadiophores that can keep that iron

376
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,339
in a metabolically available form so

377
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,680
there's all these different nutrient

378
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,880
interactions that are happening

379
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,059
and so when we're talking about

380
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,159
synthetics versus natural

381
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,439
um we have these anions that are in

382
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,360
great abundance that start to tie up

383
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,160
stuff but also they acidify the the

384
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,399
organic matter that's already there

385
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,860
causing a reduction in the amount of

386
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,220
total organic matter and we need you

387
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,980
know about five percent is ideal for for

388
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,259
you know ideal crop production and for

389
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,300
these biologically mediated processes to

390
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,519
be able to continue to happen and the

391
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,639
the less percent that we go under that

392
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,198
the less biological mediated processes

393
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,720
are happening so we have to add

394
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,458
continuously more and more and more and

395
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,980
it just compounds the problem over time

396
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,739
and so when we're looking at things that

397
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,539
are naturally derived or organically

398
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,820
derived we still have to look at the

399
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,159
application rates we still have to be

400
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,660
responsible and the timing the wind the

401
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:35,759
the and the why or the when and uh and

402
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,879
the in the where you know we have to be

403
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,259
mindful of the application still however

404
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,600
these things are usually less

405
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:48,240
resource dependent and they're also less

406
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,060
energy dependent and then they're less

407
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
environmentally impactful or they don't

408
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,659
have an environmental impact that's

409
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,159
going to be negative they usually it

410
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,620
will have a positive environmental

411
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,958
aspect to it because with an organic

412
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,919
Amendment like a meal and we'll divide

413
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,619
these up

414
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,479
we have meals which are going to be a

415
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,159
slower release you'll get some nutrient

416
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,440
availability right away when you apply

417
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,519
those but things like alfalfa meal

418
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,959
soybean meal blood meal uh bone meal

419
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,480
guanos those types of things they'll

420
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,239
take a little bit up to three or four

421
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,720
weeks to be completely broken down

422
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,278
now so that those are all organic and so

423
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,379
we're talking about organic amendments

424
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm usually talking about meals

425
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:34,019
specifically because those are a

426
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,300
carbon-based organic substrate that

427
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,519
actually takes the breaking down of that

428
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,198
material for whatever's in there to be

429
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,899
released into the system and become

430
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:47,819
metabolically available for the plant

431
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:50,100
and the bacteria and fungi in the soil

432
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,600
then then there are the rock minerals

433
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,540
that you have things like calcium

434
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,560
phosphate azomite um

435
00:16:54,539 --> 00:17:01,039
you have uh you know glacial rock dusts

436
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,659
you have those type of things that are

437
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,879
usually going to increase your cation

438
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,759
exchange capacity

439
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,400
your ECE of your soil it's usually going

440
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,818
to bring in some type of calcium Source

441
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,959
some type of phosphorus usually and then

442
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:21,298
Trace trace minerals

443
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:25,558
and then you have your natural salts

444
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:29,339
right things like Epsom salt gypsum

445
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,899
um oh also step back uh in those Rock

446
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,579
minerals we also have things like

447
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,820
calcium silica

448
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:37,980
and also uh lighting agents that will

449
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,019
help with ph

450
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,679
then we get into

451
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:45,960
natural salts Epsom salt gypsum which is

452
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
uh calcium sulfate we have all the

453
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,019
mineral sulfates that are all naturally

454
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,940
occurring potassium sulfate and then all

455
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,500
the micronutrient sulfates

456
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,360
and then also for Boron either Borax or

457
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,339
solublear which is sodium borate which

458
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,199
is another naturally occurring salt and

459
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:07,199
again these things aren't detrimental

460
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,700
and in the systems but you do still have

461
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
to be mindful of what you're adding in

462
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,640
because you're looking for sufficiency

463
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,619
but you're also looking for balance

464
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,299
between all the elements

465
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,418
and so

466
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:21,058
uh the difference between all of those

467
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,059
elements is that three to four weeks on

468
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:28,259
the organic meals usually you'll have

469
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:31,798
some mineral availability in the Rock in

470
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:34,740
the Rock minerals like you know calcium

471
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:39,480
silica you'll get the silica and calcium

472
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:41,700
a nice portion of that is available

473
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,798
and then you have your salts salts are

474
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,720
immediately available and so what

475
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,940
happens is they disassociate when you

476
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,700
put them in water some of them will

477
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,919
react uh

478
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,240
with other elements so that's one of the

479
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,880
things that you need to be you know

480
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,538
mindful of if you have a

481
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,480
if you have a cation it's going to be

482
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:06,058
attracted to an anion so that's why the

483
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,558
sulfate the sulfate is the anion and all

484
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,019
the mineral sulfates and then all the

485
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:14,220
rest of them are all cations so whether

486
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:18,000
it's zinc copper manganese magnesium or

487
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,100
calcium they all have a sulfate uh state

488
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,140
that they can be in

489
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,759
those disassociating water and they're

490
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,759
metabolically available right away so

491
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,038
you can add Epsom salt gypsum and all

492
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,359
your you know iron sulfate one of the

493
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,919
things that you can do when you're

494
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,779
adding these into your system is you can

495
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,140
add humic and fulvic acids and that'll

496
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:39,178
help them uh stay in a metabolically

497
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,660
available form because just because they

498
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,660
are available

499
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,320
they change things change in real time

500
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,020
right some things will bond with this

501
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,700
the plant will take some stuff up you

502
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,038
know some of the biology will use it and

503
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,720
moat and

504
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,099
immobilize it to the for the plant and

505
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,960
then it'll be in the you know and

506
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,519
that'll have to cycle to be released

507
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,240
again so a bunch of different stuff

508
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,099
happens but out of all of those natural

509
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,679
compounds

510
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:12,000
the mineral salts

511
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,740
uh will always be more available you'll

512
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,538
always have higher availability that's

513
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,279
interesting yeah I'm glad we went over

514
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,079
this first because it's definitely going

515
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,099
to be helpful as we go along here

516
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,119
because they're we're going to be

517
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,339
talking about salts we're going to talk

518
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,019
about meals and so on and so forth so

519
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,659
let's start going down this list now

520
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:31,859
calcium silicate talk to us about that

521
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:35,460
one of my absolute favorites so

522
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:37,859
calcium is a is a it's considered a

523
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,900
secondary nutrient but for a lot of

524
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:43,379
medicinal plants and a lot of heavy

525
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:47,700
fruiting plants uh calcium will actually

526
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,440
uh be about second or third as far as

527
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,580
the amount that it'll store in the

528
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,940
tissue and the amount that it will

529
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,220
actually uptake calcium mediates so many

530
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,240
different aspects this particular

531
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,440
element is it works really really well

532
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:07,019
to stabilize pH so if you have a low PH

533
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,179
it is it's not going to have as fast of

534
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,400
an acting time to increase it's not just

535
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:16,440
going to make it jump up from like you

536
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:19,980
know 5.5 to 6.5 it's more of a slow jump

537
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,279
so it it's not as fact fast acting as

538
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,500
something like high calcium agline or

539
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,740
even something like Dolomite lime

540
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,019
which will jump it up a little higher uh

541
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,079
faster

542
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:37,379
but the benefit is that

543
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:40,079
you get the calcium and the benefit of

544
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,419
the silica as well and Aldo silica is

545
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,839
not considered a an essential plant

546
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:49,320
nutrient it's as it's not needed to

547
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,240
complete the plant's entire life cycle

548
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,058
it's kind of something that really AIDS

549
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,700
in a lot of other aspects that I

550
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:59,220
not going to get too much into

551
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,080
but yeah it's a it's a Rock mineral so

552
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,380
some of it will be available the

553
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,178
majority of it will be cycled through

554
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,980
different processes through the Pieology

555
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,740
and the soil and it's one of my

556
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,079
favorites to actually front load uh

557
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,259
calcium early in the vegetative state

558
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:18,058
when plants are really starting to you

559
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,099
know fill out and put on the the green

560
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,500
foliage and everything else

561
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,798
and it helps with a lot of different

562
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,359
things like chemical messaging signaling

563
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,460
it helps with

564
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,119
um you know really thicking up

565
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,419
thickening up the the the the cuticle

566
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,399
layers uh on the the leaf surface which

567
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,159
can help as a protectant from leaf

568
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
eating insects

569
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,919
and then it's also responsible for

570
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,038
helping with you know the movement of

571
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,940
other elements

572
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:55,500
so it's really important another calcium

573
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,900
source that we would use

574
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,259
and this one is actually a salt and so

575
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,380
it has more availability right away is

576
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:07,079
gypsum or calcium sulfate it's one of

577
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,940
the other go-to

578
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:16,199
mineral elements that I use

579
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,940
to get adequate levels of calcium

580
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,360
and there are a couple of other things

581
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,240
too that I'll use for calcium

582
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:28,199
but the calcium silicate and the gypsum

583
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,120
are the number are are the the first

584
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,798
when we're talking about calcium because

585
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,359
the other elements that we're going to

586
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,460
talk about that have high levels of

587
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:40,319
calcium in them also have

588
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,740
phosphorus and some micronutrients that

589
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:46,379
are associated with them as well and so

590
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,079
in the instance that I would not want to

591
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,720
be adding in any more phosphorus if I

592
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,319
had a plenty of phosphorus I didn't need

593
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,659
to bring any in or I didn't want to

594
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,418
bring any other elements in and I was

595
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:04,280
strictly addressing calcium I would only

596
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:07,620
use the gypsum or the calcium silicate

597
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,779
now bone meals

598
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:14,339
that is going to be an organic Amendment

599
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:17,579
it is it does have carbon in it

600
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:21,418
and it also has a lot of calcium and a

601
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:24,720
lot of phosphorus so in in the instance

602
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,460
that I needed to implement and get both

603
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,200
phosphorus or maybe I didn't need

604
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,179
phosphorus really

605
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,460
but

606
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,140
you know my like my you know it's it's

607
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,720
not gonna hurt because it's an organic

608
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,100
meal to add that extra because the way

609
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,259
that it's going to be broken down is

610
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:45,000
going to be really slow anyway so it's

611
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:47,940
not going to have an extreme impact on

612
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,038
other elements in the soil or the soil

613
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,360
biology it's not going to set anything

614
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,919
out of balance with like a bone meal

615
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,538
um unless you're using something like a

616
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,159
fishbone Meal which you could bring in

617
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:02,038
too much and you have sodium too much

618
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,840
chloride because it's an ocean input

619
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,940
so bone meal is really good calcium

620
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,099
Source you'll also have the phosphorus

621
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,600
associated with it there's some other

622
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:11,759
stuff too

623
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,819
that also has calcium but you should be

624
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,798
careful with and that is going to be

625
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:18,000
high phosphorus seabird guano and

626
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,519
typically

627
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,400
what people are using that for is for

628
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,099
phosphorus it has a high availability of

629
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,759
phosphorus and it it's pretty quick to

630
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:32,038
release even though this is an organic

631
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,720
uh substance so you can get the

632
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,720
phosphorus in there a lot faster with

633
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,200
that with the guano but you also have to

634
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,278
remember that if you're already loaded

635
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,080
up on a ton of calcium already it's it

636
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,759
might not be something that you would

637
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,259
want to add as your phosphorus

638
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,319
supplement simply because it's probably

639
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:55,019
going to have something like 18 to 23

640
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,538
percent calcium also associated with it

641
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,700
and when you're looking at a label it's

642
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:02,038
like a plant label you have a part on

643
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,860
there that has your NPK

644
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,140
right and your calcium and magnesium and

645
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,819
all that stuff isn't off isn't always

646
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,580
going to be on there it might be listed

647
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:14,038
on the back if it's listed at all and so

648
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,720
from a consumer standpoint if you know

649
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,759
about your NPK and you're trying to

650
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,798
address something just for phosphorus

651
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,798
you're inadvertently adding something

652
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,379
that you may not want to be adding

653
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,418
so it's important to know exactly what

654
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,520
other elements are associated with the

655
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,140
mineral amendments or the organic meals

656
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,119
that you're using now regards to bone

657
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,580
meal there's some controversy behind it

658
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,158
right it's kind of like a not the best

659
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:40,379
source to use so I think you're talking

660
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
about it being a byproduct from the

661
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,000
slaughter industry and the the same can

662
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,140
be said about things like blood meal but

663
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,880
this is this is the issue

664
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,799
those Industries aren't going to stop

665
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,320
you are people are going to continue to

666
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:59,278
eat meat yes we should strive for

667
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:00,839
ethically sourced and we should

668
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,159
but that comes with our dollar that

669
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,619
comes with the buying power of the

670
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,520
consumer so that is that falls on the

671
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:11,759
consumer to you know uh get their meat

672
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,379
from producers who have ethnic treatment

673
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,319
of animals

674
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,900
that being said it you know

675
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:22,200
all of the waste that comes from any

676
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:25,200
industry if it were not recycled and

677
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,558
used for some other purpose it's just

678
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,419
going to go to waste and so the it's

679
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,359
there there there's a conflict right

680
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,059
okay so there are producers and I'm not

681
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,418
using like that we get R all of our bone

682
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:42,839
meal uh locally so we know where it

683
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:46,679
comes from and what it's not like these

684
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:49,798
giant desert cattle Farms that exist in

685
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,480
like New Mexico and stuff like that

686
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,980
these are all

687
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,319
uh you know Oklahoma and in Texas uh you

688
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,880
know it's a it's a product uh that's

689
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:05,819
being recycled for and repurposed and so

690
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,320
it's kind of a double-edged sword when

691
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,778
it comes to it because yes we need

692
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,339
ethically sourced we have to you know

693
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:12,538
obviously

694
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:15,480
um

695
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:18,778
if we're not using the byproducts though

696
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,240
then then they're going to waste so

697
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,980
you know it's going these industries

698
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,319
exist

699
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,940
and they're they're going to create

700
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,220
byproducts

701
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,558
whether or not you

702
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,839
buy that type of meat or that type of

703
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,899
product that's personal preference I

704
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,298
know as a company and I'm into organic

705
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,419
waste recycling that we're going to take

706
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:43,980
waste from the industries that we

707
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,580
operate with

708
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,140
because we want to close those carbon

709
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:52,579
cycle Loops we want to get that carbon

710
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:56,400
back into soil we're once to

711
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:58,500
promote regenerative farming systems and

712
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,240
we want to be able to do things in a

713
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,538
manner that is less detrimental to

714
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,298
our our environment and to our own

715
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:12,359
selves you know so

716
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:14,278
but yeah you're right it is it is

717
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,500
it's one of those things you know you

718
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,480
might not want to buy products if that's

719
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,859
that's the case but then you have to

720
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,778
look at where the products are coming

721
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,519
from where they're sourced from and so

722
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:24,960
we've done our we do all of our due

723
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,058
diligence when it comes to all of the

724
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,538
inputs that we use

725
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,798
um when it comes to both our soil our

726
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,919
compost

727
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:37,019
and all of the things that we that we

728
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,480
sell to our consumers understood all

729
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,700
right let's move on down the line here

730
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,140
this next one I actually have in my

731
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,880
garden and I use it quite a bit from

732
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,820
time to time which is magnesium sulfate

733
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,200
AKA Epsom salt talk to us about that oh

734
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,960
it's a good one

735
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,720
it is out of all the mineral sulfates it

736
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,259
actually has the highest solubility and

737
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,380
so I'll um a little goes a long way

738
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:04,679
and typically

739
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:07,460
when it comes to you know medicinal

740
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,500
crops and even heavy flowering fruiting

741
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,720
crops if you're doing like for me when I

742
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,480
do all of my home growth stuff I love to

743
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,360
use magnesium sulfate as a foiler spray

744
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,519
you know I like to use a tablespoon per

745
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,619
gallon and the reason is this because

746
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,440
it's really really soluble

747
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:28,558
you have uh you have

748
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,200
four major soil uh cations it's going to

749
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,418
be calcium magnesium potassium and

750
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,919
sodium we always want sodium as low as

751
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,140
possible

752
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,880
um but all the other three all those

753
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,500
four things are antagonistic to each

754
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,419
other so they need to be in Balance so

755
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,240
they can be absorbed by the plant and

756
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,600
the right ratios and when we're talking

757
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,720
about Epsom salt it's very soluble and

758
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,939
it can cause antagonisms with calcium

759
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,120
and potassium so we

760
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,860
over applying it through a soil or

761
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,798
through watering it in

762
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,479
unless you're doing what I do with the

763
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,819
Agronomy and you're doing soil analytics

764
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,798
doing soil uh soil testing saturated

765
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,178
Pace testing Leaf tissue testing and

766
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,220
whatnot

767
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,960
if you're just a home grower you can

768
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,700
kind of avoid that situation that you

769
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,798
might put yourself in by locking out

770
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,019
some of that other stuff by over

771
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,398
applying too much right because you

772
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,898
don't you might not know how much you

773
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,418
need to be applying

774
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,339
if you just use it as a foiler spray you

775
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,559
can avoid that so you can avoid that

776
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,480
negative chemical interaction that would

777
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,879
happen within the soil those

778
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,798
antagonistics uh relationships that

779
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,899
could could potentially be there with

780
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,940
the misuse and you can just use a

781
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,859
tablespoon per gallon and spray it on

782
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,840
the plants and it's going to have great

783
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,939
great efficacy now one of the things I

784
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,519
do have to mention that whenever you're

785
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,080
doing a foil an application using a

786
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,359
spray that you need to start with clean

787
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,359
water something like reverse osmosis or

788
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,038
distilled water because if you're not

789
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,839
using clean water you could have a lot

790
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,480
of sodium or a lot of bicarbonate or

791
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,599
your pH could be you know really really

792
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,460
high and so it decreases the efficacy of

793
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,678
what you're trying to apply so when

794
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,778
you're using clean water you have a

795
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,659
greater efficacy you know the plant's

796
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:15,898
not uh yeah there's not any kind of

797
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:18,600
negative reactions antagonisms that are

798
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:21,058
actually happening because the water it

799
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,119
you know has high you know boron in it

800
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:25,079
or this or that or what not you know so

801
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,759
tablespoon per gallon is a little bit

802
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,619
different for me I used to use a

803
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,658
teaspoon per gallon it looks like I need

804
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,959
to update up my dose a little bit there

805
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,760
I always use as a foiler as well and you

806
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,220
can do it a couple times a week even too

807
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,038
you can go and spray and one day wait

808
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,839
another day spray again like it's

809
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,898
I wouldn't recommend doing more than

810
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,759
three times a week but that is a really

811
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,798
really great way and one of the things

812
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,839
that I see pretty consistently across

813
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,398
the board and uh your Leaf margin so

814
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,319
they'll start to show a little shadowing

815
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,298
in between the veins where it'll kind of

816
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,158
be a slight discoloration that's a very

817
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,898
verse that's not the very first sign but

818
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,340
the the leaf petiole will actually start

819
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:05,158
to turn purple

820
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,778
that's a good sign so if you start there

821
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,059
you can do your foiler sprays and you

822
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,099
can kind of avoid all that and the thing

823
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,918
about magnesium is it's a photosynthetic

824
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,839
element so at the center of every uh

825
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,120
chlorophyll molecule

826
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,639
is going to be magnesium

827
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,219
right so you need it for chlorophyll for

828
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,080
the plant stiff to photosynthesize so it

829
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,720
it can be a really limiting factor

830
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,058
especially in veg if you do not have

831
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,319
enough magnesium everything else is

832
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,819
going to slow down because your plant

833
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,798
doesn't have the ability to

834
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:37,319
photosynthesize or create more

835
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,658
chlorophyll in the chloroplast and

836
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,339
you're never doing a foiler and

837
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,740
flowering is that right

838
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:46,500
up to about

839
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:49,099
um week two you can you know during the

840
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,200
bolting but I try not to spray anything

841
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:54,000
after we've had like you know flower

842
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,860
sets the last thing that I spray is

843
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,700
usually around day 21.

844
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:01,619
I'll do uh I'll do my my pruning on my

845
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,600
plants that need to be done bottom prune

846
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,459
up all the stuff whether it's you know

847
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,199
medicinal herbs or even you know

848
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,300
tomatoes and stuff like that Peppers you

849
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,940
I prune all that stuff up all that crap

850
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,740
on the bottom so the energy is at the

851
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,320
fruiting sites and I'll spray

852
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,358
trichoderma and bacillus septillus as a

853
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,280
combination and they have so many

854
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,659
benefits it has benefits as a soil

855
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,879
drench but as a foiler application

856
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,260
that's the last thing I spray and that's

857
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,539
usually for the prevention of things

858
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,460
like botrytis and powdery mildew and

859
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:31,980
crops it helps suppress any type of

860
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,619
leaf-borne pathogen and then it also

861
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,440
works as an end of endophyte so it will

862
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,179
penetrate inside of the plant cell and

863
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,639
it will help fight off any other type of

864
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:45,300
pathogens so we're basically what we're

865
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,800
doing is we're inoculating the the plant

866
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,240
um endosphere

867
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,320
uh

868
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,000
and the uh the phylosphere uh to

869
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,679
basically out-compete other pathogens

870
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,539
and kind of give that extra layer of

871
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,579
protection Endo fights are super

872
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,858
interesting that's that's a whole nother

873
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,480
episode itself yeah we get really deep

874
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:06,059
into that but it's really really cool

875
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,679
yeah dude dude the way that microbes

876
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,420
work when you start understanding

877
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,879
actually understanding microbial

878
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,079
metabolism and like what photosynthesis

879
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,760
is right because there are a lot of

880
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,019
different

881
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,320
microorganisms that photosynthesize in

882
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:21,059
fact photosynthesis in Plants came from

883
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,760
bacteria that that combine with their

884
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,480
cell I mean if we're looking at

885
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,240
chloroplasts right they have their own

886
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,219
sets of DNA and cells and so they

887
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,858
replicate independently of the plant

888
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:35,219
cells themselves and so it's a it's a

889
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:37,440
it's an ancient function of a symbiotic

890
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:40,078
relationship that became encapsulated

891
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,460
into one system it's a very very

892
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,859
fascinating and when you're looking at

893
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,480
microbial metabolisms we'll have to do

894
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:49,078
that one another episode

895
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,760
uh magnesium you don't want uh too high

896
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,160
a magnesium actually going into

897
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,440
flowering also or get remember it's a

898
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,299
photosynthetic element and so if you

899
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,700
have too much it'll actually decrease

900
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,000
your just like nitrogen it'll decrease

901
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:05,519
your your cannabinoids it'll decrease uh

902
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,159
terpene expression so it can have some

903
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,440
negative impact on some additional herbs

904
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,480
while on some other herbs it'll have

905
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,519
positive impact like on tomatoes you're

906
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,920
going to have you know better

907
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,719
uh the health benefits if you have more

908
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,420
magnesium more calcium stuff like that

909
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,159
so it depends on which specific crop

910
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,000
you're growing that these that these

911
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,279
things

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,300
um they're situational you could say wow

913
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,400
that's interesting I didn't know that

914
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,320
one okay let's move down the list a

915
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,019
little bit further here uh we are at

916
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,539
soybean meal talk to us about that yeah

917
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:37,639
so we'll let's talk about both soybean

918
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:40,519
meal

919
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:43,440
alfalfa meal

920
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:45,659
uh blood meal

921
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,679
Feathering and feather meal these are

922
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:48,838
all

923
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,879
nitrogen sources they're used pretty

924
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,119
much for nitrogen sources and while they

925
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,358
do contain small amounts of of other

926
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,460
elements typically we're not addressing

927
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,838
you know we're not going to address iron

928
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,338
with soybean meal we're not going to

929
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:04,500
adjust calcium with soybean meal

930
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:06,539
although they have small amounts of that

931
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,219
in there we're looking at these

932
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,639
specifically for nitrogen these are

933
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:14,639
nitrogen inputs there are also

934
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:17,940
biostimulants like amino acids that can

935
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,118
be categorized into an organic Amendment

936
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,500
as well however that's more of a bio

937
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,900
stimulant and it has much more

938
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,358
beneficial properties than just the

939
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,660
meals themselves and they operate a

940
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,980
little differently on the plant's

941
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:34,618
metabolism

942
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,760
and so when we're talking about any of

943
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:41,579
these these meals they all take use

944
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,220
typically between three and four weeks

945
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,519
to be completely broken down so you get

946
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:48,959
some solubility of nutrition when you're

947
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,960
applying it

948
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,980
but it's a slow release and you can and

949
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,720
by week four the majority you know I

950
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,219
think for blood meal and feather meal

951
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,299
it's three weeks a hundred percent

952
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:03,059
release

953
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,280
of of that you know if the blood meal

954
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,259
was at 14 blood meal

955
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,320
and you put in a pound of it you can

956
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,000
figure out what the PPM of that is by

957
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,039
you know doing some mathematical

958
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,019
conversions

959
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:19,199
and you can figure out okay so I'm

960
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:21,599
getting this much PPM of nitrogen over

961
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,460
the next four weeks and so you can kind

962
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,200
of that's how I know how to do my

963
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,940
application rates as far as when I'm

964
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,098
looking at agronomic data and giving

965
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,079
people personal recommendations for

966
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,900
their crop

967
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,180
and each one of those is a different one

968
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,220
you know soybean meal in Alfalfa are

969
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,799
going to be

970
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:42,959
um they're going to be plant-based right

971
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,500
and they're going to have a slightly

972
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,119
lower nitrogen content than than the

973
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,239
animal based products like the feather

974
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,858
meal or the blood meal

975
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,578
those are going to have a higher

976
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:57,539
nitrogen value

977
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,339
the

978
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,920
the uh

979
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:04,799
soybean meal I really like that that's

980
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,599
one of my go-to's that is like one of my

981
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,240
absolute go-to's it's about seven

982
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,579
percent nitrogen and it has about three

983
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,699
and a half week span to where it will be

984
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:17,280
completely broken down it it

985
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,078
offers a little bit of a difference in

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,700
comparison to something like blood meal

987
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,060
because the blood meal will have higher

988
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:25,679
ammonium uh concentrations in it as

989
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:29,519
opposed to

990
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:33,000
the uh soybean meal which has more

991
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:35,699
complex nitrogen Source like amino acids

992
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,380
it has amino acids associated with it or

993
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:40,739
nitrogen that hasn't been broken down

994
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,780
fully while the blood meal will have a

995
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,399
it has a higher nitrogen content and a

996
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,880
higher amount of that nitrogen content

997
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,000
is going to be in its ammonia ammonium

998
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,039
form which means it's going to be more

999
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,420
readily available so when you put that

1000
00:39:53,039 --> 00:40:01,559
in it will have way more solubility than

1001
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,838
the other types of meals like soybean or

1002
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,759
the or or alfalfa meal Alfalfa has

1003
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,039
actually a really really small usually

1004
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,920
only one maybe two percent nitrogen

1005
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:14,159
associated with it and it has a slower

1006
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,579
release as well so that might be a total

1007
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,920
release of maybe like 75 percent over

1008
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,079
four week period of time now what about

1009
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,200
kelp meal would you group that into that

1010
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,060
same category or no no if you look at if

1011
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,338
you look at kelp meal and this is one

1012
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:31,559
the things I absolutely do not use cow

1013
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:34,858
milk I after all of the research that

1014
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,539
I've done kelp meal is a no-go and this

1015
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:40,739
is why

1016
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:43,320
uh at when I've looked at maybe 20

1017
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:46,739
different brands uh suppliers of kelp

1018
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,380
Mill there's only one single company and

1019
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,699
that is espoma

1020
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,519
that has

1021
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:56,219
low arsenic okay so across the board

1022
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,440
kelp is notorious for for arsenic

1023
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:02,000
contamination

1024
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,760
um espoma had like one point three seven

1025
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,838
PPM all the rest were between

1026
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,760
uh 20 to 30 percent uh PPM parts per

1027
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,739
million of arsenic

1028
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,940
and now so that's a great concern

1029
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,239
especially when we're talking about

1030
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:21,358
commercial uh production of food or

1031
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,219
medicine especially in you know

1032
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:26,159
medicinal herbs

1033
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:27,719
um we we we're testing we we get you

1034
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,858
know we have to test these products and

1035
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,779
that can be a huge problem for

1036
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:33,358
commercial cultivation

1037
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,519
so and then if you look at the actual

1038
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:38,400
nutrition of kelp if you're looking at

1039
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,960
the NPK it's usually less than one

1040
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,119
percent across the board we might have

1041
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,240
one percent nitrogen you might have half

1042
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,820
of a percent or 0.25 phosphorus and

1043
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,098
maybe half a percent potassium

1044
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,260
the amount of kelp that you would need

1045
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,800
to add into a system to bring that

1046
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:59,760
system to nutritional sufficiency

1047
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,579
would be exponentially more detrimental

1048
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,200
because of the high heavy metals the

1049
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:06,720
high sodium and the high chloride

1050
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,159
content because all kelp has high sodium

1051
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,139
chloride

1052
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,598
sodium and chloride because it's an

1053
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:14,639
ocean input and all ocean inputs well

1054
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,338
there's oyster shell crustacean meal

1055
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:22,739
fish bone meal all those things have

1056
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:24,599
higher uh sodium associated with them

1057
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:26,459
and so when you're adding a bunch of

1058
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,740
kelp if you're trying to add it in there

1059
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,199
to bring these systems oh I need to my

1060
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,479
NPK levels up it's not an adequate

1061
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,799
source of those to bring it up and then

1062
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,539
the amount that you would have to bring

1063
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
in you would detrim you would it be

1064
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:39,539
detrimental to that system that's one of

1065
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,858
the things that we're talking about just

1066
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:43,199
because something's organic doesn't

1067
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,578
necessarily mean safe or doesn't

1068
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,480
necessarily mean that it's going to have

1069
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,400
a positive benefit the cons for kelp for

1070
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,920
me and the people that I work with and

1071
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,900
consult with the cons outweigh the pros

1072
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,780
is what I'm saying so there's more

1073
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,720
native impact associated with using kelp

1074
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,420
now the thing that most people will say

1075
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,059
oh I want to use kelp for the the

1076
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:10,619
phytohormones the things like the The

1077
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:14,400
Oxen which is endocetic acid or the

1078
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:16,260
cytokinin or the gibberellic acid or the

1079
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,358
trace mineral elements

1080
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,640
well you can find most of those Trace

1081
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:22,318
mineral elements in most of the organic

1082
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,078
meals like I was talking about before

1083
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,059
blood meal bone meal feather meal they

1084
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,800
all contain Trace mineral elements your

1085
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,900
compost contain traceant mineral

1086
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,720
elements and then we also have and if

1087
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,358
you're looking strictly for like

1088
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:40,500
um a phytohormone input the the benefit

1089
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:42,719
from plant hormones I use kiaja I use

1090
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,000
cold pressed kiaja not the dehydrated

1091
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,219
but the cold pressed and that's because

1092
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,139
the kiaja doesn't have any of the

1093
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:52,739
negative associations with the heavy

1094
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:54,960
metals the sodium the chloride

1095
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,179
but it does contain all the bioactive

1096
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,460
compounds the organic saponins it

1097
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:03,480
contains all of the cytokine and

1098
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,280
subrulins and and into acetic acid

1099
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,260
as well as a bunch of other things like

1100
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,359
amino acids

1101
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,280
so there are you take different

1102
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,900
approaches and I know which approaches

1103
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,420
work best for the practical application

1104
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,800
of these things now the science most of

1105
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,539
the science will say oh kelp works

1106
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,700
wonders kelp works wonders but most of

1107
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,318
these things are done on just regular

1108
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,519
food crops and none of those food crops

1109
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,159
are being tested

1110
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,838
you know what's what is the the end

1111
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,639
result you know what are the metals

1112
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,639
levels content what is the actual

1113
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:35,039
mineral nutritional value of these so we

1114
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,559
can get bio-stimulating effects from a

1115
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,059
lot of different things including

1116
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,380
microorganisms and so I take just a

1117
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,358
different approach when it comes to kelp

1118
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,858
and that's my reasoning behind that

1119
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,019
understood yeah I was going to ask you

1120
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:47,818
about the cytokinins the hormones toxins

1121
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:50,280
because you hear about people using kelp

1122
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,619
specifically for those reasons so I'm

1123
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,200
glad you got into uh into that one our

1124
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,960
cold pressed kiaja is actually sourced

1125
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,919
from regenerative Farms down in Chile

1126
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,159
and it is now if you were to look at the

1127
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,318
comparison of like the other products

1128
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,118
that are the dehydrated products that

1129
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:12,358
they have a higher

1130
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,720
um content of saponins because there's

1131
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,420
everything else has been extracted out

1132
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:21,659
with our product we have 8.6 percent

1133
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,639
saponins which is very high but it's

1134
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:26,338
also all of the other bioactive

1135
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:29,159
compounds and the diversity of those

1136
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:31,139
saponins so you might only get maybe

1137
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:33,719
um like 70 or something like that with a

1138
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,338
dehydrated product and then with a cold

1139
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:39,598
press product you'll get something like

1140
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:41,338
114 115. saponins huh that's interesting

1141
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,338
up next let's talk about potassium

1142
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:47,818
sulfate yeah so potassium is a

1143
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:50,519
interesting element in the fact that

1144
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:53,159
the plants need it in abundance it is a

1145
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:56,519
macronutrient it is a it's responsible

1146
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:59,639
for the opening and closing of the guard

1147
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:02,519
cells it is responsible for sodium ion

1148
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:05,940
pumps for you know diff uh to make

1149
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:07,800
diffusion work across cellular membranes

1150
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,019
um it's it helps with water transport

1151
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,359
because it it you know those guard cells

1152
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:14,940
on the stomata they open it up and allow

1153
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,799
for transportation of nutrients and

1154
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,920
water throughout that system potassium

1155
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,480
is responsible for for that system

1156
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,000
it's got a bunch of different things

1157
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,900
that it does however

1158
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,599
these think potassium comes from

1159
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,599
uh mineral mineral appetites it usually

1160
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:39,059
comes from minerals right and

1161
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:41,220
it is not typically in abundance in you

1162
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:43,559
know uh conventional agriculture soil

1163
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,858
outdoor soils most of the land that we

1164
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,599
see uh isn't really super fertile like

1165
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:51,598
you you would have to remediate it

1166
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,160
before you could uh grow crops or you

1167
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,039
have to use fertigation techniques and

1168
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,739
crop covers and add carbon whatever so

1169
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,599
when it comes to potassium sulfate it is

1170
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:05,639
a mineral sulfate it's a naturally

1171
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:09,420
occurring mineral that allows us to get

1172
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:13,078
that much needed element

1173
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:16,800
really quickly when we need it now

1174
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:19,079
there are a couple of different things

1175
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,480
that I use for potassium now potassium

1176
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,160
comes in in a couple of different ways

1177
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,318
typically in soil

1178
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,539
so composts

1179
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,579
it comes in composts and not in huge

1180
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:31,139
quantities where usually maybe two three

1181
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,760
percent potassium when we're talking

1182
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,618
about compost and those are all slow

1183
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,280
release now

1184
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:40,440
we potassium I see uses is is probably

1185
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,180
the number two element

1186
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,460
um especially in hot and heavy fruiting

1187
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:46,318
and medicinal plants have recruiting for

1188
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,300
vegetable varieties I mean we need a lot

1189
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,059
of it it needs a lot of potassium a lot

1190
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,619
of these plants do

1191
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:54,779
so we can get it from potassium sulfate

1192
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,700
another another one is potassium silicas

1193
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,560
is what I like is another thing that I

1194
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:00,719
use which is

1195
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,679
um the trade name agsil 16 it's

1196
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,239
essentially uh potash and sand heated up

1197
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,118
really hot together it's mixed together

1198
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,759
and it's a water-soluble form of both

1199
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,720
potassium and

1200
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:18,960
silica in monosilic acid in that form so

1201
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,239
it is available form in a very it's the

1202
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,139
least expensive form of silica so if

1203
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:28,078
you're using a silica Amendment

1204
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:32,460
this is by far the most cost effective

1205
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:35,880
way to get silica in it has uh one it's

1206
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,338
got 32 percent potassium by volume so

1207
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,160
you can use small amounts to get

1208
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:44,279
the potassium that you need and it is

1209
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:46,259
water soluble so you can mix it into a

1210
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,319
fertigation tank and water it in you can

1211
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,140
also foiler apply axial 16 potassium

1212
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:54,420
silica and it works really really well

1213
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,858
because it it changes the pH of the

1214
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,380
water makes it really high so if you're

1215
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:01,679
using it as a foiler application it'll

1216
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:04,380
change that it'll temporarily change the

1217
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,358
um the phylosphere of the plant which a

1218
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,579
lot of pathogens don't like that so it

1219
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:11,039
can be used as a fungicide in that

1220
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,200
respect well also adding the potassium

1221
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,838
and the silica which is uh available to

1222
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,318
the plant as a spray as well

1223
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:21,659
the potassium sulfate

1224
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:23,460
it depending on how much it's processed

1225
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,739
and what I mean by processing is they'll

1226
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,199
they'll micronize it they'll grind it up

1227
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,000
so you can get it in chunks and the

1228
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,059
benefit of having chunks is that you can

1229
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,159
get it as a top dress and just kind of

1230
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:37,259
leave it in there as your top dress and

1231
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,539
as you water in it'll slowly release

1232
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,640
over time when you have higher granulars

1233
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:44,219
also if it's a granular form of

1234
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:46,500
potassium sulfate and you're using that

1235
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:48,239
in like a soil mix the benefit is that

1236
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,119
it'll be a slow release but it'll also

1237
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,679
add pore space and so that'll help with

1238
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,140
you know water penetration throughout

1239
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,000
that soil system if it's a granular it

1240
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:00,179
also comes in fully water so water

1241
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,900
soluble uh form so that way you can add

1242
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:05,818
it to a reservoir or you can water it in

1243
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,519
and again because it is a mineral

1244
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:11,880
sulfate it's going to be metabolically

1245
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:15,179
available so you can use this to quickly

1246
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,700
adjust levels like so if I were to get a

1247
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:21,598
soil test back and I saw that somebody's

1248
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:24,598
potassium was low my go-to is usually

1249
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:28,400
going to be potassium sulfate or axial

1250
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:31,680
16. there are other things that contain

1251
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,838
potassium like green sand right I've

1252
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,399
seen people try to use green sand as a

1253
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,019
potassium Amendment but the problem is

1254
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,300
this

1255
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:42,719
the release of potassium for green sand

1256
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,900
is so slow we're talking about

1257
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:48,299
you know several months to years

1258
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:52,019
for it to become available so while it

1259
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,359
does add some component of aeration

1260
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:57,300
and a very very small component of

1261
00:50:54,358 --> 00:51:00,539
potassium it's one of those things that

1262
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,640
is is almost just like an extra that you

1263
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:04,079
could have in there if you wanted to and

1264
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,900
it's not going to hurt it's not going to

1265
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,880
really affect anything

1266
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,119
but I can't but it's not something that

1267
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,579
I could you know recommend as a you know

1268
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,019
as an as an agronomist and say hey this

1269
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:18,960
is what you should be using to try to

1270
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:21,780
get your system back into sufficiency

1271
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,880
because it just doesn't add the amount

1272
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,460
that's going to be needed to bring it up

1273
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,740
in a adequate amount of time

1274
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,139
another another a mineral amendment that

1275
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:34,078
we can talk to talk about is solpomag

1276
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:35,338
also known as kmag also known as

1277
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,720
langbonite

1278
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:41,759
now it usually has around 22 percent

1279
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:44,879
potassium right but what they're what

1280
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,400
what you're not typically looking at is

1281
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,680
on the back of it it also contains

1282
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,019
sulfur and magnesium and the problem

1283
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:57,539
with langbonite is that the magnesium

1284
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:59,159
and that sulfur are way more soluble

1285
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:01,380
in this when they're in the system

1286
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:04,799
either as a top dress or if it's been

1287
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,200
you know if you've you know tried to mix

1288
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,599
it with water let it dissolve the

1289
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,399
magnesium in there if you're trying to

1290
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,019
address just potassium you have to

1291
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,300
remember potassium and magnesium are

1292
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:17,639
antagonistic so if you're deficient in

1293
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,680
potassium you go add sulpomag or

1294
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:22,739
langbonite thinking hey this has got 22

1295
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,259
percent potassium it's all gravy you

1296
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:28,799
just neglected the fact that you added

1297
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,500
in nine percent magnesium that is pretty

1298
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,079
much 100 soluble so you have this

1299
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,239
partially soluble 22 percent that's

1300
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,300
going to be slow released over the next

1301
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,939
couple of months versus this magnesium

1302
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,480
that you just added in jacking up your

1303
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,800
magnesium levels creating more

1304
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,019
antagonisms between the magnesium and

1305
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,940
the potassium so you could actually be

1306
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:52,980
thinking you're putting in a potassium

1307
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,220
amendment when what what you're doing is

1308
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:58,019
actually uh making its less available

1309
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:59,699
for the potassium that's already in

1310
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:01,380
there because you just jacked up the

1311
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:03,299
magnesium and you didn't need magnesium

1312
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,980
that's crazy yeah there's a lot of

1313
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,599
Growers that reach out to me that

1314
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:09,059
they're Tinkers they like to add things

1315
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,039
in as they see fit and they're throwing

1316
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,660
off the balance the overall balance and

1317
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,699
they're really getting into hot water

1318
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:16,318
there because sometimes it's hard to get

1319
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:18,598
Back in Balance in that case right do

1320
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,699
you have any tips for for that yeah so

1321
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,579
what what I'm typically looking at the

1322
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:25,818
the there are some major things and the

1323
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:28,920
the three major things are going to be

1324
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:32,159
sodium bicarbonate and chloride so

1325
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:35,880
bicarbonate will antagonize

1326
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:40,679
all of your cations calcium magnesium

1327
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:43,559
iron uh just everything you know and so

1328
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,899
it makes it so that way the plant has to

1329
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,660
work way harder to get what it needs so

1330
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,700
even if you have sufficiency and

1331
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:52,679
everything is balanced in there if

1332
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:55,259
you've got really high bicarbonate

1333
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:57,179
levels it's going to drive down the

1334
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,500
ability for the plant to uptake those

1335
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,598
nutrients

1336
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,300
the same thing can be said with sodium

1337
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,300
when sodium levels get higher and higher

1338
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,579
and higher it causes osmotic stress on

1339
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,440
the plant the plant actually and then

1340
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:13,859
and then if you have events where you're

1341
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,500
drying out your soil well then your ECE

1342
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:19,440
spikes and your and you have all of this

1343
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,858
oxidation occurring of all your mineral

1344
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,260
elements it's it it's not conducive to

1345
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:28,318
plant Health right it causes a lot of

1346
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:32,280
osmotic stress it causes issues with

1347
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:34,920
with all the other nutrient interactions

1348
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,800
and then chloride chloride chloride is

1349
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,358
an anion and high chloride will also

1350
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,760
negatively affect

1351
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,880
those types of elements that are anions

1352
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:49,020
phosphate nitrate

1353
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,519
um molybdenum so there's sulfur

1354
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,079
also one of the things that you have to

1355
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,119
look at is sulfur sulfur can cause

1356
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,920
osmotic stress as well and so if your

1357
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,539
sulfur levels are too high and they can

1358
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,960
especially if you're using a lot of

1359
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,579
mineral sulfates and so I you know I'll

1360
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,280
change up the mineral sulfate sometimes

1361
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:07,619
I won't use gypsum or potassium sulfate

1362
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,800
at all and I'll use calcium silica and

1363
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:12,240
axial 16 because if my sulfur level is

1364
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,800
already high and I go ahead and add

1365
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:15,838
those in I have to be mindful that I'm

1366
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,200
also adding a certain amount of sulfur

1367
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:21,960
into that sulfur is an anion it's used

1368
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:24,299
to help with charge balance it's also

1369
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,338
used for protein production it's used

1370
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,440
for oil production it's used for a lot

1371
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:30,358
of different things in the plant and you

1372
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,260
need it it's a photosynthetic element as

1373
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:33,239
well

1374
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,640
so

1375
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:40,199
but

1376
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:44,219
when you dry out that sulfur causes EC e

1377
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:47,279
spikes the electronic conductivity of

1378
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:52,318
the soil it spikes up and cause issues

1379
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,420
with osmotic pressure and then also it

1380
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:59,159
can have some negative impacts on other

1381
00:55:54,420 --> 00:56:01,500
anions like phosphorus and uh nitrate

1382
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:04,139
you mentioned sodium and bicarbonate and

1383
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,780
that's uh that's the reason why I can't

1384
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:09,179
use my tap water here where I am is

1385
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,740
because we're looking at about 80 PPM of

1386
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:13,679
sodium and it's real high in

1387
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:15,358
bicarbonates as well pH is high so I'm

1388
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:17,039
not even I can't even use my tap water I

1389
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,199
have to filter it I've been using

1390
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,699
reverse osmosis but that's another area

1391
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,980
where I think a lot of people kind of

1392
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,838
neglect looking at is they don't

1393
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,280
actually have a one they don't get a

1394
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:28,019
water test so they don't even know what

1395
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,700
they're they're using to begin and then

1396
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:31,380
they're adding in these amendments along

1397
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:33,539
with their water and it's jacking

1398
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,420
everything up yeah and so what happens

1399
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:38,159
too is it's not necessarily going to be

1400
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,780
an issue the first round the second

1401
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,480
round the third round but what happens

1402
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,099
is a lot of times these problems are

1403
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,139
compounded over time and so you bring

1404
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,700
sodium a little bit a little bit a

1405
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,259
little bit a little bit until it adds up

1406
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,818
to a point where someone's like dude I

1407
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,559
don't know what's going on I can't

1408
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:55,318
diagnose the issue I haven't done

1409
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,599
anything different my regimen's the same

1410
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:59,039
what's going on and it's and that the

1411
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,119
first thing I do when I go to a consult

1412
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,318
say hey you guys need to make sure

1413
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,960
you're testing your water I don't care

1414
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:06,058
if you're using Ro City water well water

1415
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,679
it all has to be tested and we'll test

1416
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:09,180
if you're on a well we'll test your well

1417
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,118
water we'll test your RO water we're

1418
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:14,279
gonna see if we even need Ro right we're

1419
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,599
going to see if if we just need specific

1420
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,460
filters because we're not trying to

1421
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,019
waste money either you know we're not

1422
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,760
trying to waste water we're trying to be

1423
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:25,739
as as environmentally positively

1424
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,599
uh you know we we want to we don't want

1425
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:29,279
to create more issues we want compound

1426
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,200
problems it's the same thing with kelp

1427
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,660
you know oh what's happening I'm

1428
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,399
starting to fail for arsenic well it's

1429
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:38,759
come to a point where that arsenic

1430
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,440
finally built up in into the soil

1431
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,420
because you kept bringing it in with

1432
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,099
certain products you know you can you

1433
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,420
can mediate that by just knowing you

1434
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,180
know but the thing is home Growers

1435
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:51,180
aren't they they're they don't test

1436
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:52,799
you know they're not testing and uh

1437
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,679
commercial facilities a lot of times

1438
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,180
don't test it's a very it's it's very

1439
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,000
seldom

1440
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:02,578
that people are doing what I'm doing in

1441
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,760
the industry that I work in when it's

1442
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,800
pretty standard practice across all the

1443
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,960
rest of the agriculture industry you

1444
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,480
know whether you're growing corn or soy

1445
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,699
or ornamental flowers or tomatoes

1446
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,139
there's Agronomy and data involved where

1447
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,000
we want to know how much of what we need

1448
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:19,980
to use so we don't over apply and so we

1449
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,719
keep nutritional sufficiency and balance

1450
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,460
heavy metals is another area where we

1451
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:24,779
could do an entire episode on if we

1452
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,480
wanted to I've been learning so much

1453
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,220
about heavy metals recently and um it's

1454
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,980
and they're called scary they're complex

1455
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:33,659
they're complex too the way that they

1456
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,240
work but we'll save that for another

1457
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:38,279
episode we do have time for a few more

1458
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:39,419
of these amendments to go over I know

1459
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,680
you got the list in front of you is

1460
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,180
there ones you want to kind of pick out

1461
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:45,298
that you'd like to talk about here yeah

1462
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:47,338
we can kind of uh we can kind of put all

1463
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:48,900
of the micronutrient sulfates all

1464
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:51,480
together in one which would be iron

1465
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,780
sulfate copper sulfate zinc sulfate

1466
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,179
manganese sulfate and then sodium borate

1467
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:00,740
okay these are these are all natural

1468
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:05,338
natural salts and they're using

1469
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:08,159
extremely extremely small quantities and

1470
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:12,779
what I mean extremely small I'm usually

1471
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:15,598
talking about one-third to a half

1472
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,660
and you know the the most that you would

1473
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:21,059
do was maybe like three teaspoons

1474
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:24,118
per yard of soil so we're talking about

1475
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:25,980
for every you know 650 pounds of soil

1476
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,599
you have we're talking about you know

1477
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,059
maybe half a teaspoon you know for

1478
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,700
something like sodium borate to bring

1479
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:36,079
that to sufficiency for several runs you

1480
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:39,539
could put in point you know

1481
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:42,420
0.33 of a teaspoon or one third of a

1482
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,980
teaspoon into one yard of soil

1483
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,960
and know that you're going to have

1484
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,659
enough Boron and that you're not even

1485
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,960
have to address Boron for that for the

1486
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:54,539
remainder of of your your your grow

1487
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,720
this is kind of the same thing with with

1488
00:59:54,539 --> 01:00:01,318
zinc and copper and and manganese the

1489
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:04,078
amounts that you use are so low that

1490
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:06,239
it's actually hard to use them as a top

1491
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,920
dress right so typically what we're

1492
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,118
doing with these micronutrient sulfates

1493
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,760
is

1494
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,798
were Distributing them evenly over the

1495
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,559
soil surface using either a spray

1496
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:19,318
application or by watering it in

1497
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,000
so let's say I have a yard of soil and I

1498
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:22,858
know hey I'm going to be using a five

1499
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,480
gallon I'm going to use five gallons for

1500
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:26,759
this yard of soil so I'm going to mix my

1501
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,500
nutrient sulfates into this yard of soil

1502
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,119
with my humic fulvic acid and I'm going

1503
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,159
to water this in so I have an even

1504
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,559
distribution of all of these

1505
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,239
micronutrient sulfates

1506
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,980
um but when we're talking about like if

1507
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:43,379
you started off with zero micronutrients

1508
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,960
copper uh iron you're gonna have a

1509
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:49,079
little bit more you could put in about a

1510
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,079
cup and a half to two cups per yard of

1511
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:56,339
soil but when we're talking about

1512
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:59,519
uh let's say zinc you'll you could do

1513
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:02,279
two and a half teaspoons for an entire

1514
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,960
yard of soil that has nothing been added

1515
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,400
to it as far as micronutrient and you

1516
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,318
are going to be sufficient and that will

1517
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,160
give you enough sufficiency

1518
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:12,960
to go for several runs as long as the

1519
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:14,519
biomass that you're pulling off like

1520
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,980
your Leaf material and stuff is getting

1521
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,960
recycled back into your system

1522
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,420
now if you're taking all of your biomass

1523
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,699
out of your soil system and not letting

1524
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:27,780
that cycle back naturally you're gonna

1525
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:30,719
have to add more sooner with copper you

1526
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:33,359
can do the same three and a half

1527
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,798
teaspoons for an entire yard of soil

1528
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:36,480
will bring you up to nutritional

1529
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,139
sufficiency for

1530
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,659
a while for a long several Cycles

1531
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:43,699
manganese sulfate you can do two and a

1532
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:46,500
half

1533
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:49,679
teaspoons and bring that up to

1534
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,739
sufficiency sodium borate is half of a

1535
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:55,318
teaspoon

1536
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:58,679
borax just regular borax would be twice

1537
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,000
that amount or one one teaspoon

1538
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,818
and then you don't have to do it anymore

1539
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,280
and you could even if you were to take

1540
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:08,579
those and start off with nothing and

1541
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,519
stretch those out over a six month

1542
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:14,519
period and be like I'm gonna add one

1543
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:18,000
milliliter of this one you know

1544
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:21,380
it's like those ratios right there are

1545
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,059
solid and we'll get you know get you to

1546
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,619
nutritional sufficiency so a little goes

1547
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:28,619
a long way with those micronutrient

1548
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:30,900
sulfates yes and unless you're talking

1549
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,460
about the the macronutrients or

1550
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,160
secondary nutrient sulfates like

1551
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,659
potassium calcium and magnesium right

1552
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:38,818
because calcium sulfate magnesium

1553
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:40,858
sulfate potassium sulfate

1554
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:44,400
you usually use a little bit more those

1555
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:47,460
are in the cups per yard like I might do

1556
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,280
uh you know half of a cup of magnesium

1557
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,079
sulfate if I was deficient you know I I

1558
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,298
it depends you know it depends on the

1559
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,400
target the data but I'm always just

1560
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:57,719
looking at the data and saying hey this

1561
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,818
is how much is missing this is how much

1562
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:01,739
needs to be added got it I think we have

1563
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:04,079
time to squeeze in azomite you want to

1564
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:07,019
talk about that a little better yep so

1565
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,420
azomite is one of the Amendments that I

1566
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:11,579
don't currently use anymore uh I have

1567
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:16,019
found that it doesn't contain enough of

1568
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:18,298
anything to realistically be of any use

1569
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:20,880
that's what I found about it it says it

1570
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:22,880
has a to z micronutrients and minerals

1571
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,680
but when we're looking at a sufficiency

1572
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,200
perspective the amount of azomite that

1573
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,298
you would have to bring into a system to

1574
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:34,318
actually have

1575
01:03:30,298 --> 01:03:36,900
the right amount of calcium or manganese

1576
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,159
or zinc or that other stuff it's just

1577
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,220
not there

1578
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,598
it just doesn't exist so but there are

1579
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:44,759
things that are associated with that

1580
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:48,660
have been associated with azomite such

1581
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:51,059
as heavy metals and aluminum

1582
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:53,699
that could have detrimental impact on

1583
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:55,920
the soil so this is one of those things

1584
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:59,159
where for me

1585
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:03,539
the cons outweigh the pros so I don't

1586
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:05,639
see a big benefit if I wanted to add in

1587
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:07,558
a type of rock mineral

1588
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:09,539
I'm looking at it from us what

1589
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:11,099
perspective why am I bringing in this

1590
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:12,119
Rock mineral do I need to increase my

1591
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:15,359
ECE

1592
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:18,119
do I need to bring in calcium do I need

1593
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:20,219
to bring in phosphorus

1594
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:21,660
um all my micronutrients are covered

1595
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:24,298
because I have micronutrient sulfates

1596
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:26,338
and I have also meals organic meals that

1597
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,798
contain those things so

1598
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:30,838
it's more of just like a luxury thing if

1599
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:34,019
you want to add it in you can I don't

1600
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:36,058
recommend pump like relying on it for

1601
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:38,579
anything in specific because it's not

1602
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,640
going to do one specific thing it's just

1603
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:43,260
kind of a luxury item to have that you

1604
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:46,139
could use

1605
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,880
and I always go with the less is more

1606
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:49,500
approach right if it's not something

1607
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,780
that I don't if I don't have to spend

1608
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,880
extra money on it if it's not necessary

1609
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:57,059
I'm not going to especially not at scale

1610
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,338
because all of those additional costs

1611
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:01,740
they all add up and as a small business

1612
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:03,599
and as a farmer all of those additional

1613
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:05,699
costs are something that we could have

1614
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,940
put back into our pocket at the end of

1615
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:10,919
the day and use for you know to take the

1616
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:16,260
family on vacation you know get some

1617
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:18,659
much needed R and R or you know to

1618
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,579
get the tractor repaired or get the

1619
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:21,480
tools that we need to to be successful

1620
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:23,220
so

1621
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,400
I'm always looking at this from really

1622
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:28,259
cost uh analytical perspective and

1623
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,180
that's actually the reason why I got

1624
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,059
into Organics because I did Hydroponics

1625
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:34,798
for 11 years and then I switched to soil

1626
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:37,740
and I was using chemical synthetic

1627
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,719
fertigation salts and it wasn't until I

1628
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:42,598
needed to find a better uh business

1629
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:44,519
model how I could reduce my costs that I

1630
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,039
really started to look at all of the

1631
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,960
inputs and that's the biggest thing as a

1632
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,460
cultivator there's so many products on

1633
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,960
the market and one of the classes that

1634
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,539
we're going to be doing and we'll have

1635
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,519
that live on page on our patreon is

1636
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,440
going to be I'm going to have the people

1637
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:00,000
that come into the class bring stuff in

1638
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,440
from their home that they're using and

1639
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,599
we're going to talk about what is in

1640
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,338
there you know if you have a bottle a

1641
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,079
bottled nutrient let's say Advanced

1642
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:10,440
Nutrients right or something like that

1643
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:12,119
that's uh 96 percent water and it has a

1644
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,920
little bit of dymonium phosphates a

1645
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,660
magnesium sulfate and potassium sulfate

1646
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,119
in it well you can buy all those things

1647
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:19,379
in bulk and cut and save yourself on

1648
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:21,180
shipping a bunch of water and getting

1649
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,980
ripped off

1650
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:24,480
you know it's you're being overcharged

1651
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,000
and then you're being taxed for shipping

1652
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,719
and so it's it's it's really important

1653
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,420
for any person who's cultivating at home

1654
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:35,818
to understand what the product is that

1655
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,619
they're using and if they're using X

1656
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:39,538
product that has this this and this and

1657
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,280
this and it know individually what these

1658
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:43,319
components are used for and what what

1659
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,280
benefits they have and and then figure

1660
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:46,798
out hey

1661
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,780
can I figure out how to apply this

1662
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,239
single element itself like if something

1663
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,220
has bone meal and crab meal and epsom

1664
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,779
salt and gypsum and humic and fulfic

1665
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:56,879
acids and all this other stuff and

1666
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,280
they're jacked up the price way high

1667
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,380
because they blended it when you know

1668
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,260
you have to look at that you have to be

1669
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,640
able to distinguish what is in the

1670
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,079
products that you're using and figure

1671
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,838
out

1672
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:11,160
if you could do it more cost effective

1673
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:13,739
or

1674
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:15,659
if you're being you know charged extra

1675
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:17,459
money just because there's a fancy logo

1676
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:19,920
on it a lot of people fall into the Trap

1677
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,179
of buying more than what they need and

1678
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,700
really yeah they're spending more money

1679
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:25,199
than they need to and they could be

1680
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:27,419
spending their money elsewhere and it's

1681
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:30,358
also one of the reasons why I do package

1682
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,639
up these amendments individually for

1683
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:34,558
people and there is a surplus on that

1684
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,798
because it costs labor and packaging and

1685
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,900
all that other stuff but we also Supply

1686
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:42,179
bulk and 50 pounds so that way if you're

1687
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,338
a farm or if you're if you need to get

1688
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:46,199
these things in larger quantities you

1689
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:48,480
don't you're not spending the money the

1690
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:49,858
extra money to have it packaged and the

1691
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,960
labor associated with that so you can

1692
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:53,940
buy it all at the wholesale price which

1693
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,980
is way more cost affordable I mean when

1694
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,318
you go and buy a 50 pound bag of Epsom

1695
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:00,838
salt for 25 bucks

1696
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,940
I mean bam that's money you know you can

1697
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:07,199
buy a 50 pound bag of gypsum for like 17

1698
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:09,059
18 bucks in most cases you know so if

1699
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,399
you have a provider someone that's local

1700
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,900
to you that has all those things it's

1701
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,220
just much more cost effective and it's

1702
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,500
much more sensible from a business

1703
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,479
perspective that makes sense so let's uh

1704
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,279
let's wrap things up now who tell us how

1705
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,379

1706

about pricing and all that other stuff

1726
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:21,179
and then our patreon

1727
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,279
um because of the censorship on social

1728
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:25,259
media and we're seeing that right now in

1729
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,080
the news Congressional hearings all that

1730
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:31,500
other stuff it's been uh it's been

1731
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:34,859
difficult to really reach a lot of the

1732
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,779
people that that are following um so we

1733
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:39,900
are off platforming you know we're

1734
