00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,199

uh I just kept it because I'm like I

97
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,359
need something to stand out but anyway I

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,280
am a I'm from Georgia I was raised in

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,920
Georgia I'm a military vet after I got

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,479
out of the army I basically stayed where

101
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:53,078
I was at rather than going back home and

102
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,438
then just by happen stance I just got in

103
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,239
my head I want to be a content creator I

104
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,199
used to watch a guy custom grow 420 I

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,640
don't know if you remember him I haven't

106
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,759
watched him in in a long time I was like

107
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:08,318
oh customer grow used YouTube YouTube

108
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:12,199
YouTube I used to love that guy but but

109
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:15,479
I started being a content creator 420

110
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,039
2016 and then I started actually growing

111
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,439
October

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,879
2020 so I've been growing almost four

113
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,680
years next month will be four years that

114
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,040
I've been growing and as far as the

115
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,199
organic side I'm really leaning towards

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
it number one it's probably easier lot a

117
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,960
lot easier for people to do because you

118
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,279
don't have to do the nutrients every

119
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,079
time that's actually how I found you you

120
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,198
have a video where you were doing

121
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,879
showing Blue Planet nutrients and you

122
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,840
were showing you know what order you

123
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,759
should put it in that's how I actually

124
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,000
found out about you whenever I started

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,240
growing so you helped me out whenever I

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,600
first started you was using you was

127
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,360
using uh black strap molasses said I'm

128
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,879
using black strap molasses so I really

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,439
appreciate that when I was starting and

130
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,680
then your book on Amazon right yeah like

131
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,000
so you really helped me when I started

132
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,560
but I I really leaned toward it's

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,800
organic because from Mr Kut grow he

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,000
calls it the lazy man way of growing I

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
just think it's really efficient the

136
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,279
organic way because you only have to do

137
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,478
the dry Ms every three or four weeks as

138
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,478
opposed if you're doing synthetic then

139
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:19,399
you know every time you feed well some

140
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,839
people do feed water feed water whenever

141
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,679
I'm doing synthetic I'm usually doing

142
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,478
feed every time unless the plant tells

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,280
me otherwise but every time you do it

144
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,439
then you have to do the nutrients and pH

145
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,038
and all the rest of it so organic kind

146
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,038
of lean towards me and plus I'm an

147
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,879
autopot grower I seen your interview

148
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,159
with autopot amus I'm an autopot grower

149
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,759
as well and so for what I do it just

150
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,479
really just leans towards a better grow

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,520
and easier for me to deal with a whole

152
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,279
bunch of plants got it so your overall

153
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,959
grow style you say now you're more

154
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,198
organic you were synthetic before are

155
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,519
you growing indoors or outdoors and also

156
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,038
are you in soil or cocoa or hydroponic

157
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,159
system I'm an indoor grower I've never

158
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,519
grown outdoor yet I will do it I love

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,280
mindo dope they have those big plants

160
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm like y I want to do that too but I

161
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,918
haven't got that yet so all of mine are

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,079
indoor now I love cocoa and perlite I

163
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,120
actually love the the mother earth 7030

164
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,439
bag cocoa perlite that's my favorite one

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
to use but I have been growing with uh

166
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,680
soil as well like the ones that I just

167
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
did recently they were all with soil I

168
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,840
did that so that people can see that

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
with auto Poots some people think that

170
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,959
you can only do Cocoa with autopots but

171
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
you can also do soil as well as well so

172
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,638
I wanted to show that and plus I wanted

173
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,240
to show the different setups that

174
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,840
autopot has that they even gave my own

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,400
setup the Basse drop keys autopot system

176
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,959
which I appreciate autopot for shout out

177
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,679
to them uh but I wanted to show that you

178
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,159
could with autopots you can still do

179
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,680
soil but I I prefer Coco and perlite the

180
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,160
mother earth Coco and perlite okay and

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
so you're fully in the autopot system

182
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,520
you're not in like individual containers

183
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,638
what size I think autopots has a couple

184
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,799
different size containers that are in

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
their system what size do you use right

186
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,879
so my the normal one is the 3.9 gallon

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,360
pots and if they get the bass drop Key

188
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,080
System it's going to be 3.9 gallon pots

189
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,000
but just recently I've been using the

190
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,680
double XL system they come in a 9 gallon

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,038
and a 13 gallon pot I just did the 9

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,639
gallon ones and then with the 2XL system

193
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,199
they have the 6.6 gallon plastic pots

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,879
and I use those as well because I I had

195
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,240
a 5x5 tent two five two 5x5 t0 and I put

196
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,199
two of those in each of them so that's

197
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,240
why I want to use the 6.6 gallons as

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
opposed to the 3.9 gallon that I would

199
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,400
normally use because I'm only doing a

200
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,439
limited amount of plants but they have 9

201
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,638
gallon 13 gallon 6.6 gallon and then the

202
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,158
regular one is 3.9 gallon got it yeah I

203
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,319
think I have the 3.9 gallon ones uh I've

204
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,759
got them jeez it had to have been four

205
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,439
or five years ago now and uh great

206
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,158
system really really good system we've

207
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,918
talked in podcast episodes in the past

208
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:59,560
kind of about the system and how it

209
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,719
works and stuff like that so we won't

210
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,280
really get into any of that but I do

211
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,440
want to know really your water only

212
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,119
style and you mentioned use soil and

213
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,478
that's what you've been doing for this

214
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,959
is there a particular bagged soil that

215
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,240
you use or is it a custom mix that you

216
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,959
create like what's in your mix to begin

217
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,120
that's great uh super simple Fox Farm

218
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,799
ocean Forest I've used it so many times

219
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,399
now that I know that you can get at

220
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,000
least 30 to 35 days without having to

221
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,719
put any more nutrients into it Fox Farm

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,440
ocean for is the base for it I have used

223
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,918
uh builda soil before too I had a good

224
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,399
grow with that one but the most I I've

225
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,038
used this fox farm ocean forest and

226
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,879
that's the base of the soil whenever I

227
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
use soil and then after that it's

228
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,120
amendments every three to four weeks Fox

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,240
Farm I feel like it's really a bad rep

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,039
you know you got a lot of people that uh

231
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,480
have mentioned oh they're too strong for

232
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,958
seedlings and they're going to burn your

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
seedlings what's your what's your take

234
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,439
on that all the all the time it's crazy

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,079
it's crazy I just read a comment like 20

236
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,839
minutes before we started somebody said

237
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,278
that you didn't burn up your seeding

238
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,560
with the fox form guys you can you can

239
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,439
check it out right on my channel the

240
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,078
seedings go right into it I'm not doing

241
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,320
anything special I used to do the uh

242
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,759
napkin method germination style you know

243
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,800
with the bag and everything but just

244
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,480
putting it right into the

245
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,120
soil that there's no problems so I don't

246
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
know where it ain't it too hot I haven't

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,039
had an issue with it one time yet yeah

248
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,759
I'm not sure where that came from I I

249
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,838
also use Fox F motion for a soy I've

250
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,078
used it for 14 years now and uh I might

251
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,920
have seen that on one of your videos I'm

252
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:34,599
trying to tell you when I first started

253
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,639
it was a big resource I still watch your

254
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,720
videos now obviously but when I first

255
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,799
when you first start that's when you

256
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,000
need a majority of your help oh for sure

257
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,519
yeah yeah yeah and I have the same

258
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,839
experience with you where I I don't

259
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,240
really see that burnt seedlings

260
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,920
happening I don't think I've ever I've

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,200
had like one plant struggle in that soil

262
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,958
and that was a sour diesel which is

263
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,079
notorious for being finicky when it

264
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:01,838
comes to the growth nutrient uptake and

265
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,879
stuff that so like yeah I I think I'm

266
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
going to do a whole video on does Fox

267
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,759
Farm ocean FL soil burn seedlings or not

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
and just show people my result I've

269
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,679
never had one issue with it the one time

270
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,560
that I did though it wasn't it was my

271
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,719
fault because I put more amendments in

272
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,479
it from the beginning and that's when I

273
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,759
find you don't need any more amendments

274
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,800
it's already has nutrients end it

275
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,679
already so that's the one time it was my

276
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:29,359
fault so people make mistakes and then

277
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,679
try to blame the breeder the company the

278
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,399
soil come everybody but themselves no I

279
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
messed up my bad everything's cool you

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
start out with Fox Farm ocean for soil

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,078
and not adding any additional amendments

282
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,639
so at what point do you add in

283
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:43,958
amendments because EV eventually that's

284
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,240
going to deplete right did you say the

285
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,078
30 40-day Mark right um from me using it

286
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,879
just you know just by experience because

287
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,039
I've only been growing next month is

288
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,879
going to be four years that I've been

289
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,919
growing but I already have over 50

290
00:10:53,879 --> 00:11:00,919
Harvest under my belt if I was doing 10

291
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:03,078
12 15 at a time that's on my channel the

292
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,599
seed to harvest videos which people

293
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,000
usually know me by as far as that

294
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,159
channel there's already like 38 seed to

295
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,720
harvest videos on there and plus I'm I

296
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,919
obviously I haven't recorded every grow

297
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,240
that I've done so in four years I've

298
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:21,799
done over 50 grows and the way that I do

299
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,000
it is straight out of the bag Fox Farm

300
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,240
ocean Forest this is when I'm using soil

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,320
and then on the

302
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,919
calendar I just on day 28 we're doing

303
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,879
dry amendments and for me I'm using down

304
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,599
toe dry amendments I know a lot of

305
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,240
people like Gia green Mr I never heard

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,639
of gu green until Mr cut grow and then

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,879
when I wanted to get Gia green it wasn't

308
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,759
available in the US it is now but I use

309
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:50,159
down

310
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:53,919
toe and worm worm castings 444 484 dur

311
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,639
Bloom super simple s and I was in the

312
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,000
Army and we have a a method in the Army

313
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,240
called kiss it's it's really keep it

314
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,639
simple stupid but you know people all PC

315
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,039
you can't say stupid now so it's keep it

316
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,440
simple

317
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,199
Soldier and the the point of that is the

318
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,200
minimum that you can do to get the job

319
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,639
done and get a great result we're trying

320
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,959
to be as efficient as possible so burm

321
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,440
castings allpurpose vegetable garden

322
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,679
that'll be just fine and then once you

323
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,639
get to uh flower add the 484 in there

324
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,278
and that's it super and water that's it

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,320
we have a lot of people here that tune

326
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:36,480
in and they take notes and they want to

327
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,480
emulate what some of the guests do can

328
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,399
you give us specifics on how much down

329
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,720
to earth 444 you're giving the plant in

330
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,360
worm castings on the first feeding

331
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,639
versus the second feeding and so on and

332
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,240
so forth yes it really depends on which

333
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,198
pot I'm using because either I'm using

334
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,839
the 3.9 or the 6.6 usually but just

335
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,159
recently I said I did those nine gallon

336
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,639
pots so that's my first time using like

337
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,039
the big n gallons

338
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:06,320
but I'm it's really simple I'm not even

339
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,679
changing it one cup worm castings one

340
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,199
cup of vegetable

341
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,638
garden that's it if it's if it's a 3.9

342
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,759
gallon I'll do half a cup if it's 6.6 a

343
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,519
full cup if it's the nine or above I was

344
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,399
doing a little bit over cup out a cup

345
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,360
and a quarter something like that and

346
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,600
that's it I didn't change it every I do

347
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,320
it every four weeks unless sometimes you

348
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,879
know that you you could the yellow one

349
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
starts coming in the plants and so you

350
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,838
can obviously see that they're going to

351
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,879
need some food before it's time so

352
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,399
sometimes I might do a week early but I

353
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,399
try to do every four weeks but sometimes

354
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,519
it's every 3 weeks one cup and I don't

355
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,320
even change it throughout the the next

356
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,720
time that I it's usually only going to

357
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,680
be two times know you because the first

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,120
30 days you're good to go the next uh 28

359
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,479
days you're going to be getting ready

360
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,000
for flour and then you're going to do it

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
one time in the flower cuz it's usually

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
8 weeks 9 weeks 10 weeks somewhere

363
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,360
somewhere in that area so you only do it

364
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,560
one time in flower as well and I do the

365
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,079
same thing one cup half a cup if it's

366
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:16,000
3.9 one cup if it's 6.6 one and a

367
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:19,319
quarter if it's a bigger pot the net

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,198
super simple okay so the 444 you're only

369
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,959
using when the plants are in veg and

370
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,278
then when you go to flower you're swe

371
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:29,559
you're taking out the 44 four 484 no I'm

372
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,240
sorry I use that too so it's worm

373
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:36,758
castings one cup

374
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:40,480
484 444 vegetable garden and then I add

375
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,959
484 whenever it's in flower flower only

376
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,360
right just flower only is when I used to

377
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:49,119
484 okay is that the top dressing right

378
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,199
before flower right so I do uh because

379
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,919
I'm I'm not going to say usually but

380
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,198
lately I've been doing two months of veg

381
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,519
so the first 30 days they got covered by

382
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,439
what's in the bag then I do the dry M

383
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,799
then they go another other month then I

384
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,880
do the dry M whenever I do the dry M

385
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,758
this time whenever I flip them in the

386
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:10,759
flow that's when I add the 484 and then

387
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:13,278
they get one more time in flour the same

388
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,560
thing 484 and then that's it because you

389
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,519
know usually it's eight weeks nine weeks

390
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,838
10 weeks until you harvest sometimes I

391
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,278
mean I had some Auto flowers that went

392
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,360
11 or 12 weeks that was crazy though

393
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,240
yeah those long flow ones you can really

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,759
get into hot water especially if you

395
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,519
think you're growing like an eight weer

396
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,720
or nine weer and all of a sudden you get

397
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,879
to like week 6 7 and you're like this

398
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,399
isn't starting to ripen and then all of

399
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,480
a sudden you're at week 10 11 12 and

400
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,440
it's like oh I should have done another

401
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,159
feeding it was so crazy my biggest

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,880
Harvest so far out of all those harvests

403
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,198
I told you about was actually a

404
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:52,720
Autoflower fast

405
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:55,198
buds uh West Coast OG from Fast buds was

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,440
my biggest Harvest ever and I was like

407
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,479
it's Autoflower and that's the first

408
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,079
time I ever experienced Bud rot I never

409
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
had bud big enough to have to worry

410
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,758
about it till them I had the big I was

411
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,638
like goodness these autof flowers are

412
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,278
strong they're not like the old

413
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,959
autoflowers people were talking trash

414
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,480
about them you know oh yeah back in the

415
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,559
day it was totally different when didn't

416
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,680
yield as much as photos could you know

417
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,479
nowadays that's a whole different story

418
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,599
so autoflowers are amazing now some of

419
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,759
them are really amazing I'm I think I'm

420
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,759
going to do autoflowers for my next

421
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,399
runs because uh a couple companies were

422
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,240
kind enough to send me some some seeds

423
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,879
maesto you talked about misto on here

424
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,360
before and uh fast bud I got some seeds

425
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,600
from Fast Bud shout out to them so I'm

426
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,000
think I'm going to do some Auto flowers

427
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,000
next runs awesome and so that feeding

428
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,198
regimen that you mentioned do you ever

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,559
have plants that just don't like it and

430
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,639
you see deficiencies or is every plant

431
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,758
that you give that regimen to healthy

432
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,600
throughout the whole grow no no people

433
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,720
watch my content then they know I show

434
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
the good the bad if it if it happens I

435
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,160
show it so just because it's a bad

436
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,720
growth you're going to see it so no that

437
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,838
I wish that was great oh man I almost

438
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,240
went off on the tangent but we're going

439
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,078
to keep it

440
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,318
great no on my um on some of the plants

441
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,918
some of these plants are stubborn and

442
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,359
then can't treat every plant the same so

443
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,240
some of them need some extra Love

444
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,678
sometimes and then it's frustrating

445
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,318
because you're doing everything that you

446
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,880
think that you can do but it's not

447
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,480
enough and I know some of the times you

448
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,799
talk about uh VPD and EC and that type

449
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,079
of stuff I don't ever check that until

450
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,480
there's a problem so you know why

451
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,199
everything's healthy whatever the the

452
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,079
grow going fine I don't worry about BPD

453
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,160
or EC or anything as soon as there

454
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,639
starts being problems then I start

455
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,120
really trying to go into what's going on

456
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,440
other than that it's really just pH that

457
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,038
I worry about and that's about it

458
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,640
whenever I do have problems for the most

459
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,679
part I've been lucky because it's been

460
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,679
like a lack of calcium you know or

461
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,360
something like that and so now they do

462
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,679
have organic cow mag I have used that

463
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,918
before on my organic grow TPS they make

464
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,960
some great organic cow mag so I use that

465
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,880
and for the most part that's usually

466
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,159
what it is because whenever you use dry

467
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,240
amendments for you guys that don't know

468
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,760
dry amendments are not like synthetics

469
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,319
when you put synthetic in your water the

470
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,960
plant can uptake it right then and there

471
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,839
with dry amendments they have to break

472
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,919
down first it's not readily available so

473
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,879
sometimes especially if you catch a

474
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,240
deficiency late you put your dry Mim you

475
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,120
did that and you're watering from the

476
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,960
top you remember I'm using autopots you

477
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,199
know it's a bottom wicking system but

478
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,519
whenever you do dry mims in it you need

479
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,319
to water from the top to help the

480
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,759
nutrients break down so while you're

481
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,439
doing that the three or four days it can

482
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,319
get kind of worse and so sometimes I'll

483
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,120
go ahead and just use that organic cow

484
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:50,079
mag and it it is readily available to

485
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,319
the plants and it can uptake it a lot

486
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,720
faster so that's really how would help

487
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,839
me a lot is that organic calet is that a

488
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,440
powdered form or liquid and do you know

489
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,519
the application rate for it yeah it's uh

490
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,960
it's made by TPS and it it's a liquid

491
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,440
and so you can do it just like if you

492
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,720
were doing your synthetic nutrients for

493
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,759
me using autop Poots you know we have a

494
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,640
reservoir and so you can just put it

495
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,359
right in in your Reservoir that's why

496
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
it's readily up that's why the plants

497
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,439
can uptake it so fast if it was like a

498
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,120
drop powder or dry Amendment you know it

499
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,240
take a couple days okay so it's soluble

500
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,798
bioavailable so the plant can upake it

501
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,919
right away got it exactly so some of the

502
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,759
plants will take that feeding regimen

503
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,320
like you mentioned Others May struggle

504
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,279
and you know you'll utilize Cal Mag how

505
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,158
about compost teas that's another thing

506
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,119
that people use when they're growing

507
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,799
organically if they kind of want to have

508
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,798
a little boost to the microbial

509
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,480
population for example and help with the

510
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,798
amendment breakdown do you utilize

511
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,120
compost teas it all yes for sure I

512
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,079
actually got that idea from Mr Kut grow

513
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,959
I think anybody that's know do what we

514
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,240
do know watched him he hasn't put out a

515
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,279
video in a while shout out to him I hope

516
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,919
he's coming back but um um

517
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,720
compost te's are super simple to do I

518
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,400
just use a air pump and I'm using all

519
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,519
for my entire grow I'm using reverse

520
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,960
osmosis water I don't know if that makes

521
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,000
a difference to a lot of you guys but I

522
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,960
don't use the tat water anymore I

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,440
haven't done that in a long time the

524
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,120
reason why is because with with tat

525
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,038
water there's other things in it besides

526
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,519
water I rather have reverse osmosis

527
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,759
water that's already filtered and that

528
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,480
way if you want to you're doing

529
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,359
synthetic then you can add whatever you

530
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
want to add to it but for me I'm not

531
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,558
adding anything to it we just want the

532
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,280
water itself but anyway I'm going off on

533
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,839
the tangent what was the question again

534
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,798
it was about compost teas if you can

535
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,240
kind of break down how you how you do

536
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:46,119
them compost teas the the the simple

537
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,599
recipe is worm castings and then you

538
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,319
also need some type of sugar and I told

539
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,439
you you use black strap molasses I use

540
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,599
black strap molasses so that's my sugar

541
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,320
that I use for the compost tea and then

542
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,678
I have used a little bone meal in there

543
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,798
before before but or alpha alpha I've

544
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,240
used before as well but usually the

545
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,240
compost te and the uh black strap

546
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,640
molasses you can get away with just that

547
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,960
by itself if you're in you can make

548
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,559
compost te's for veg you can make

549
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,200
compost te's for flour depending on

550
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,918
where you are in the grow you can use

551
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,840
that same 444 484 down to earth G green

552
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,600
whatever dry Mims you guys are using you

553
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,158
can use those same dry Mims and worm

554
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,639
castings to make your compost tea just

555
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,640
need a bucket air pump super simple are

556
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,840
you doing like a five gallon bucket

557
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,400
exactly five gallon bucket and what's so

558
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,839
great about compost teas is you can

559
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,440
really spread it out you can put them in

560
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,158
other buckets and then thin them out and

561
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,919
use them because they're super strong

562
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,120
you can water it down so if you're doing

563
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,880
a lot of plants like I used to do I had

564
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,399
15 16 tents in in one

565
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,440
house obviously you can't do but so many

566
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,159
five gallon buckets so you can actually

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,038
thin it out and you can a little bit

568
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,039
goes a long way compost teas is it you

569
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,519
usually do what you fill up the 5 gallon

570
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:01,480
bucket like almost all the way about

571
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,599
four gallons worth and then put what is

572
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,440
it one cup of worm castings is that you

573
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,359
right so okay so the process that I do

574
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
is I fill up the five gallon bucket you

575
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,839
want to leave a little space on the top

576
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,440
because whenever the air pump starts

577
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,158
going it's going to start bubbling so I

578
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,919
leave a little bit of space and then

579
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
they have these little it's basically

580
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,120
like a strainer bag and that's when I

581
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,120
pour the worm castings in it's usually

582
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,158
one cup of worm castings if I'm doing it

583
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,439
for veg then it's going to be one cup of

584
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:32,320
the the 444 and then as far far as the

585
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,080
black strap molasses

586
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,960
maybe uh four or five you can get away

587
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:38,879
with four or five tablespoons but

588
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,278
honestly guys I'm putting like A4 Cup in

589
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,760
there just just pour it in there and

590
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,558
stop and after you do that you put your

591
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,240
your air pump in there I use a air pump

592
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,079
with four lines but one line is just

593
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,400
fine turn it on high and then I just

594
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,439
cover it with a towel because you know

595
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,038
it's going to be bubbling from the air

596
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,200
one thing that you guys are going to see

597
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,400
is that you're going to see a lot of

598
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
foam

599
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,519
on the top of it that's totally normal

600
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
and that's actually what you want that's

601
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,879
how you know everything's breaking down

602
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,240
as it should and So after 24 hours

603
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
you're good to go and you can feed it to

604
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
your plants awesome now how about

605
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,158
microbial inoculant some people will buy

606
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,679
those and use them or they'll do like

607
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,640
the IMO process and actually get their

608
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,120
own microbes out of the backyard right

609
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,480
do you use microbial inoculant at all

610
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:28,639
not one bit I tell you I am super

611
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,440
efficient some might call it laser

612
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
call it super efficient it's because the

613
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,400
reason I I do the things that I do is

614
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,960
because like I was telling you whenever

615
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,960
I first started growing I started I'm

616
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,960
right now I'm in New Mexico on the Texas

617
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,600
New Mexico and Mexico border I moved to

618
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,400
LA during the pandemic and that's when I

619
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,918
start I moved to LA April 1st 2020 and I

620
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,080
started growing October

621
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,960
2020 I had six tents in a studio

622
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,519
apartment well one-bedroom apartment

623
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,159
smaller than the studio and so the

624
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,798
whenever I started growing I'm doing

625
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,559
everything myself filming everything

626
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,119
myself and I got so many grows going

627
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,879
that I can't spend a lot of time with

628
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,038
each individual because when you when

629
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,679
you're struggling to make end meet and

630
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:18,278
then you find out that hey these

631
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,200
companies will pay you to to do this the

632
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:23,000
more grows you do the more money you get

633
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,798
and then also I'm trying to fast forward

634
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,398
my education Chris when I started this

635
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,519
still now I I don't I didn't have any

636
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:31,759
anybody in the

637
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,200
industry no don't know anybody that's

638
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,440
growing I just decided that I wanted to

639
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,399
do it and I just started doing it and so

640
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,960
there's nothing that can be

641
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,639
experien and so I have friends and

642
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,000
whatnot that's been growing 20 years 15

643
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,679
years can't be experience so what did I

644
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,720
do to fast forward my experience instead

645
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,120
of doing one grow I'll do six grows

646
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,159
that's how I've been able to fast

647
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:55,798
forward my experience because I have

648
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,919
friends that they grow outside like

649
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,960
traditional not light depths traditional

650
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,440
one heart harest a year grows they've

651
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,840
been growing 20 years so they've had 20

652
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,519
Harvest I've been growing four years

653
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:09,199
I've had over 50 Harvest because I'm

654
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,480
able to fast forward my education you

655
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,159
know what I'm saying so because of that

656
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,319
I'm trying to be as efficient as

657
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,960
possible that's how I found autopots

658
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,200
because I'm doing everything myself and

659
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,798
think about it you got 15 tents in a

660
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,679
house and you're hand watering

661
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,798
everything some some things need to be

662
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,320
watered once a day twice a day sometimes

663
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,359
depending on how you're doing it then

664
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,519
then I'm using cocoa you know about the

665
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,959
runoff and all that got to have a shop

666
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,158
vac we're doing too much so I'm trying

667
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,038
to be as efficient as possible so I

668
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,278
microbes I never used them got it and a

669
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,319
lot of these microbes are actually going

670
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,038
to come in on your amendments and worm

671
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,079
castings and all that stuff so exactly

672
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:53,158
other than that and CO2 I I don't use

673
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,798
CO2 or anything like that as well okay

674
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,360
all right no CO2 for you now you

675
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,038
mentioned you use R water I use AR water

676
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,678
as well do you have one of under the

677
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,759
sink units or what there is under the

678
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,919
syn unit but I have uh I usually do it

679
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,798
to the one that's outside you know it

680
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,520
plugs into the one outside I got spent

681
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,679
like a 100 bucks from Amazon the best

682
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,639
money I

683
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,919
spent because if you guys don't know

684
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,960
whenever you're trying to I started on

685
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,480
synthetic Nutri nutrients Blue Planet

686
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,759
nutrients I got that from you and you

687
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,640
know when whenever you're trying to put

688
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,278
your amendments your amendments your

689
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,278
nutrients inside some tat water or

690
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,359
whatever the case is your EC is going to

691
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,359
be too high because there's already

692
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,319
stuff in there so you need to strip it

693
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,839
down to zero so you have a good base and

694
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,000
then you can build from there put what

695
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,839
you want in there so that's why I

696
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,599
started using first osmosis water and I

697
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,199
just continue doing it in all the grows

698
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,199
yeah and out of that water you know if

699
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,080
it has a high PPM for example if you're

700
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
using tap water you don't know what's in

701
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,839
there unless you get a water test right

702
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,558
or look at the water report that comes

703
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,480
from your local water Municipal and uh

704
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:00,839
one thing I found found I can't use my

705
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,519
tap water I have

706
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:08,199
485 PPM very high in sodium bicarbonates

707
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,759
it really makes a pH very high and it's

708
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,798
just not really suitable for growing my

709
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,240
plants so I have to use an Aro system as

710
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,960
well under the zc one and uh yeah it

711
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,798
works out great so I totally totally get

712
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,000
what you mean by that now how do you go

713
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,000
about your watering you mentioned that

714
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,278
it's obviously it's an autopot system so

715
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,519
it's going to Wick up from the bottom

716
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,398
but you also mentioned that sometimes

717
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,519
you do a top watering in order to try to

718
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,439
keep those amendments moist can you walk

719
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,839
us through like when you would go about

720
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,960
doing that how much water and so on and

721
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,480
so forth right so the only time that I

722
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,880
do top watering is during the dry

723
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,440
amendments so whenever we're going to be

724
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,360
amending our dry mment the next three or

725
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,919
4 days I'm going to come in and I'm just

726
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,599
going to take I have a little water and

727
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,080
can I use as far as the reservoir for

728
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,558
the autop pots I use the 11 gallon

729
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,879
Reservoir and so I have a little

730
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,359
watering can that fits in there and it's

731
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,240
probably about four cups five cups of

732
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,000
water not that much because even though

733
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
the autopot system it Wicks from the

734
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,919
bottom and has a base you can overflood

735
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,240
the base if you put too much in there so

736
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,159
you just whenever I'm doing the dry Mims

737
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,720
the next three or four days I'm watering

738
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,399
from the top other than that it's

739
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,159
wicking from the bottom okay pretty

740
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,759
straightforward and you said you do

741
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,000
monitor the pH now you monitoring the pH

742
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,599
that you put in your reservoir for

743
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,119
example what do you typically aim for

744
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,519
that's uh if I'm in uh depends if I'm

745
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,599
doing cocoa or soil usually when I'm

746
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,200
doing soil the pH is higher than Coco

747
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,079
Coco you can go 5.5

748
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,480
6.5 if I'm doing soil then I'm really in

749
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:45,519
that maybe six to seven range as long as

750
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,159
it's in the middle I don't I never try

751
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,038
to get it very special like right on 6.5

752
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,760
I want it to be a range because to me I

753
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,599
feel like what we're trying to do inside

754
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,879
is basically replicate what's happening

755
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,879
outside and so outside they never get

756
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,159
just a constant 6.6 whatever so I just

757
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,799
make sure I have it in between 6.7 or

758
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,159
5.5 to 6 really I just if if it's around

759
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:10,759
six no matter if it's cocoa or soil

760
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,720
we're pretty much good to go somewhere

761
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,879
in that six area okay you mentioned soil

762
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,360
and cocoa and cck if I'm wrong but the

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,360
soil would be for the water only style

764
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,719
that you're doing right the cocoa is for

765
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,599
the synthetic nutrients is that right

766
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,839
right that's exactly right but I also I

767
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:29,199
have done organic and cocoa as well and

768
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:31,079
you just treat it the same way for the

769
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,919
mother earth cocoa and perite I start

770
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:35,240
with the 730 bag and then you just do

771
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:40,200
your own dry Amendment so you same thing

772
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:42,880
wor castings 44 444 the same exact dry

773
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,159
Ms that you do do the same thing except

774
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,559
whenever you start off you're going to

775
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,840
put your dry Ms in there because you

776
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:48,960
don't have those first 30 days of

777
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,798
nutrients that's already in the fox farm

778
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,440
bag already obviously you don't have

779
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,079
that with Coco so you have to give them

780
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,480
some nutrients but I've done it both

781
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,119
ways as well understood and then when

782
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,679
you are using cocoa only with the water

783
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,759
only method and you're doing those

784
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,038
initial amendments are you letting that

785
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,839
cocoa sit for a while before you plant

786
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,398
something into it or are you planting

787
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,079
into it right away I actually see a lot

788
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,439
of videos from expert Growers and they

789
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,278
do that and let it

790
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,360
sit I'm a

791
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:22,880
rookie and so I mix it and put it in the

792
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:25,398
bucket and we're off and running

793
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,039
so I've never let it sit I don't have

794
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:29,918
the time or the room to let it sit I

795
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,200
mean you know I'm a real hom grower so

796
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,960
we're doing this in apartments now I

797
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,600
have now I have a house thanks to

798
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,360
everybody supporting me thank you on

799
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,719
internet but uh I'm I'm in a studio

800
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,839
apartment one-bedroom apartment then

801
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,798
rented a house now bought a house we

802
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,199
don't have the time resources for that

803
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,440
we mix it all together put it in the

804
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,038
bucket put it in the pot we're off and

805
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,759
running no waiting has there ever been

806
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,158
problems doing that with specifically

807
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,398
the Coco route and amendments planting

808
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,880
right into it I hear people say like

809
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,359
just like the the whole seedling Fox

810
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,720
Farm is too hot on the internet I can

811
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,678
find plenty of videos and articles

812
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,519
saying that but I've never had an an

813
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,200
issue with it lot of misinformation on

814
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,960
the internet that's for sure you can't

815
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,840
believe everything that you I was doing

816
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
because you at some point you don't know

817
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,959
what's real science what's Bro Science

818
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,840
when I first started growing I was doing

819
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,960
the two days of darkness before I did

820
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:29,480
the Harvest I don't do that anymore but

821
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,000
I saw Mr kuks do it I saw some other

822
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,200
people do it I like oh this is what

823
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,558
we're supposed to do then it's like this

824
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,360
is Bro Science and I was like does it

825
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,278
make a difference then I started doing

826
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,119
it without it and I'm like I don't see a

827
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,278
I don't see a big difference here so I

828
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,678
didn't not just stop doing it so I don't

829
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:45,599
it might actually do something I don't

830
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,320
know I just don't do it anymore yeah I

831
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,678
mean at first it was that it's going to

832
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,480
help with ripening of tricomes and

833
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:56,639
tricomes are formed at night a last

834
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,519
Stitch effort to get more tricomes and

835
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,519
that was I want to say kind of bunked

836
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,319
but I actually asked Dr Bruce bugby that

837
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,558
and he says Tricom are form during the

838
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,000
day not at night so that kind of makes

839
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,398
that null and void but then there's

840
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,919
other folks that reply and say well it's

841
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,719
actually the breakdown of the starches

842
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,360
and sugars that's the reason you know

843
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,000
what I mean so people are throwing out

844
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,240
additional potential B benefits and I

845
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,919
don't think we've really there's been

846
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,359
enough studies out there to really prove

847
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,278
one way or another so yeah I mean I'm

848
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,678
not sure I just know that I'm like I

849
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,679
don't think just for me with my own

850
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,639
plants I don't see a difference but you

851
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,159
know All Growers have their own

852
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:33,038
superstitions and things ways that they

853
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,200
like to do it so I like to say if you

854
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,720
think it makes a difference and your

855
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,960
plants are fire keep doing it Different

856
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,679
Strokes for different folks that's it

857
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,639
it's not broke don't fix it me myself

858
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm move on to the next thing y okay so

859
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:49,439
that's pH EC and PPM now you mentioned

860
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,720
you only check that when there is a

861
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,240
problem what are you looking for when

862
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,480
you check it when there's a problem how

863
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,120
do you know there's a problem on one of

864
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,639
the girls that I did Gorilla Glue if you

865
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,359
guys look it was the the I found my

866
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:06,278
second favorite strain of all time is

867
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,638
Gorilla Glue friend of mine gave me some

868
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:10,960
beautiful Gorilla Glue and I found two

869
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,038
seeds in there so I had an epiphany I

870
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,639
said hey I'm a grower now I wonder if I

871
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:20,599
can grow from this bag seed so I

872
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:23,719
actually planted it grew it out cloned

873
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:26,558
it and I fill up a whole 4x4 tent with

874
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,440
this Gorilla Glue one of those plants

875
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:32,038
actually I never experien it before it

876
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,320
got nutrient lock out I never even I

877
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:35,440
heard people say it I even heard you say

878
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,759
in one of the videos if you don't do

879
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
this the right way you can get nutrient

880
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:40,919
lock out I'm like that's interesting I

881
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,119
wonder what that is and this

882
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,679
plant it just stopped uptake it wouldn't

883
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,439
uptake anything so I thought it maybe it

884
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,600
needed a flush I took it out flushed it

885
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,960
all out put it back in nothing helped it

886
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,839
ended up whenever something like that

887
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,519
happens and it's just something just out

888
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,599
of the ordinary like I said I've done 50

889
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,720
harvests at this point I don't know how

890
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,959
many plants I've done a lot of plants

891
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,600
but you see a lot of of plants and you

892
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,639
know from doing it a lot of times the

893
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,358
cycle that they should be taking PL is

894
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:10,719
in week four it should look like this

895
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,319
and you start noticing or one of the

896
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,319
plants starts lagging behind the other

897
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,399
plants if you just notice something out

898
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,720
of the ordinary that's when I start

899
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:20,279
checking

900
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,598
EC checking my VPD which I thanks to AC

901
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,599
Infinity it's real easy to check your

902
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,440
VPD now but before I needed a meter I'm

903
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,000
I can't get a meter or whatever you know

904
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,280
what I mean mean shout out a Infinity

905
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,519
they make it real easy now it's just

906
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,720
right there but that's when you start

907
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,878
checking the my VPD EC ppms everything

908
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,638
just trying to figure out is anything

909
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,679
out of the ordinary you start U flushing

910
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,039
the plant checking the runoff we

911
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,559
checking the ppms in the runoff as

912
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,000
opposed to what you put in there

913
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,799
everything that I seen from your videos

914
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,159
you showed me how to do

915
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,839
that and so I'm like I'm a an I want to

916
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,480
be an expert grower at some point but

917
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,440
right now I feel like I'm still

918
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,440
experimenting trying to find what's

919
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,039
great for me and this organic with the

920
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,519
autopots has really been working for me

921
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,000
so I I want to keep going down this

922
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,880
route but honestly when things starts

923
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,358
going wrong I'm just researching like

924
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,200
everybody else thinking about things

925
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,000
that's happened in the past you know

926
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,199
sometimes things repeat themselves if

927
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,880
you just notice anything out of the

928
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,319
ordinary that's when I start talking

929
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,559
checking all the data points that I can

930
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,280
think to check something's out of whack

931
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,000
and we got to fix it so you just do the

932
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
best that you can basically all of us

933
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
are learning every single one of us are

934
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,838
still learning even if you've been

935
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,119
growing for 30 40 years new information

936
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,920
is coming out you can still learn about

937
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,480
things and so crazy so crazy I never be

938
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,838
an expert I I I thrive to be I stri

939
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,039
thrive strive to be one one day that's

940
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,719
one thing that makes it fun though is

941
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,759
being able to just learn you know

942
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,519
there's so much to learn it's an endless

943
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,720
amount of things you can learn and have

944
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,440
experiment with really you don't learn a

945
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:58,799
lot when everything's going great every

946
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,679
time also I want I just want to say this

947
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,480
I don't

948
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:06,239
trust you know Channel channels in our

949
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,559
nich growing if I watch all your videos

950
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,919
and every video has been 100% great I

951
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:15,159
don't trust you like you've never had

952
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,760
powdery mil do never had Bud rot never

953
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,039
had pest before spider M never had

954
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,839
nothing everything's been great the

955
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,358
whole

956
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,400
time

957
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:28,400
really I don't trust you so I want to

958
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,880
see some something went wrong at Point

959
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,880
some of these channels everything's been

960
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,960
great I said okay I don't watch you

961
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,400
anymore it can be pretty clear that some

962
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,559
people are hiding their problems you

963
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,039
know content creators and I I'm just

964
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:43,279
like you where I show my problems and

965
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:45,279
yes it it kind of sucks because people

966
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,920
just hate on you because you have

967
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,200
problems oh you're a terrible grower

968
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,159
you're coming across this and I'm just

969
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,879
think I'm like no everybody's has

970
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,000
problems like you can't go your entire

971
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,240
career and not have any problems sure

972
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
you could be a newbie in your first

973
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,639
second year and have healthy plants the

974
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,760
whole way but eventually you're going to

975
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,799
come across some sort of pest eventually

976
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
you're going to come across a deficiency

977
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,079
eventually you're going to come across

978
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,519
some sort of problem in the grow space

979
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,519
and I don't think you should really if

980
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,000
you're a content creator I don't think

981
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,838
you should hide that from people you

982
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,318
know what I mean like show because

983
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,400
that's a learning experience that other

984
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:21,199
people can learn from so my first year

985
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,119
as a content creator I did this the

986
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,118
craziest thing I wish I wouldn't have

987
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,519
did so I'm doing these different videos

988
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,720
whatever and when I mess up I would

989
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,199
would just delete it and start over that

990
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,039
was the content the the mess up is the

991
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,799
content and so you don't learn that

992
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,159
until you're like no that's what people

993
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,599
need to see this so whenever whenever

994
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,159
you guys are growing and you mess up you

995
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,240
shouldn't be like oh every time I watch

996
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:47,920
Keys he's perfect no that's not reality

997
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,519
I mess up you mess up everybody's going

998
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,800
to mess up just part of it you learn

999
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,280
from it try to do better the next time

1000
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,880
exactly couldn't have said it better

1001
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,720
myself let's get into environment a

1002
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,000
little bit now you already mentioned you

1003
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,399
don't supplement CO2 you mentioned you

1004
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,760
really don't look too deep into VPD

1005
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,720
although it's on the controller now for

1006
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,359
AC Infinity so you do kind of keep your

1007
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,759
eye on it a little bit right but how

1008
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,519
about the temperature and relative

1009
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,119
humidity what do you typically aim for

1010
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:16,039
for the different stages of growth right

1011
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,519
so as you know uh as you go further

1012
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,079
along in the grow your Rh is going to be

1013
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,079
coming down hopefully your Rh is going

1014
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,039
to be coming down because if you got a

1015
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,400
harh a high RH and you're at the end of

1016
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,000
FL

1017
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
then you really really taking a chance

1018
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,800
on bud rot when I found out that the

1019
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,519
hard way when I had the 16 15 15 tents

1020
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,760
in the house all in flower at the same

1021
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,519
time it's so much humidity inside the

1022
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
house the walls are

1023
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,800
sweating and so that's when I had that

1024
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,598
problem with the bud Rod that I was

1025
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,839
telling you about those big buds with

1026
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,838
too much humidity so but answer your

1027
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,440
question whenever for you guys to

1028
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:55,480
starting off growing your seedlings they

1029
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,559
love high

1030
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,400
humidity as you go further along going

1031
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,358
to grow when you get to the end of flow

1032
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,000
sometimes you're going to be probably

1033
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,799
around 50 or 40 as far as your Rh now

1034
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,119
your temperature my temperature because

1035
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,839
I'm using my central air conditioner to

1036
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,920
help me regulate inside bedrooms that

1037
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm growing in and so usually I'm

1038
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,240
keeping it around 70 but when we get in

1039
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,480
the flower I am bringing it down to

1040
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,519
around

1041
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,880
65 in that in that area so 65 to 70 is

1042
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,519
usually where I'm at the entire grow I

1043
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,880
know some people like that 81 little

1044
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,519
little bit hotter temperature

1045
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,200
for me I'm really in that 65 the at the

1046
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,159
highest that they'll ever be is like

1047
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,799
74 that's about it as far as temperature

1048
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,118
and the humidity like I said it's going

1049
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,680
to start off high as a

1050
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:47,200
seing and I mean you can go from 99% as

1051
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:49,719
a seing to 40 45% whenever you're ready

1052
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,159
to harvest them okay and then what do

1053
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:54,318
you use for grow lights and do you aim

1054
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,838
for a specific amount of par during the

1055
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:58,358
different stages of growth or what never

1056
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:01,039
check par in my

1057
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,759
life never I'm trying to tell you don't

1058
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,199
have a I know obviously I know what par

1059
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,359
is I know it's par meters obviously I

1060
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:12,358
know about par but I've never checked

1061
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:13,719
par in my life I am I've been very lucky

1062
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:16,358
as for because you ask me about grow

1063
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,838
lights every grow that I've done that

1064
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,920
you guys can can look at every one of

1065
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,078
them has been sponsored so my first my

1066
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,720
very first grows thanks to he was

1067
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,000
actually there at the um Ace Infinity

1068
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,318
sesh

1069
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,599
Troy thanks to my buddy Troy he's great

1070
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:37,239
great guy he got me my first uh growing

1071
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,559
sponsors Mars Hydro they actually

1072
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:40,799
sponsored my first two grows just

1073
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,358
because

1074
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,599
Troy I told you I started as a content

1075
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:49,838
creator 420 2016 I didn't start growing

1076
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:52,960
to 2020 but in those four years I got

1077
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,318
pretty big as the do you dab guy I had a

1078
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,559
group on Facebook with like over 75,000

1079
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,880
people in it and I had a big Community

1080
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:04,318
called do you da and so because of that

1081
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,400
Troy told Mars Hydro hey he hasn't grown

1082
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,279
anything yet but you should sponsor him

1083
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,720
because he's going to be big and just

1084
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,119
off of Troy's word they actually did

1085
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,480
sponsor me my first two grows and then

1086
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,079
after that that's when Ace Infinity

1087
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:22,240
found me but anyway so as far as the

1088
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:23,920
lights Mars Hydro spider farmer but Ace

1089
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,279
Infinity is near and dear to my heart

1090
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,838
because that's the first throwing

1091
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,119
sponsor that I got by myself I had only

1092
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,920
been growing six months and ASN I did a

1093
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,880
um I watched Mr knut's Grow video and he

1094
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,960
did a a video on the T4 inline fan and

1095
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,559
it was just what I was looking for

1096
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,159
because I was thinking if I could have a

1097
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,920
fan that would turn on and off by itself

1098
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,759
like with parameters that would be great

1099
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,119
and I watch this video and I'm like I

1100
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,240
just thought of that somebody made what

1101
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,599
I thought

1102
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:56,118
of so I use Mr Kut

1103
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,920
code got it off of Amazon and made a

1104
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,920
video with it that wasn't sponsored

1105
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,559
obviously but it's so crazy the day that

1106
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,000
that video hit

1107
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:09,000
100,000 views I got an email from Ace

1108
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,358
Infinity saying hey we seen your video

1109
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,800
we think you got a lot of potential

1110
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:15,838
would you like to be sponsored by us and

1111
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,640
I was hell yes hell yes we've been good

1112
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:22,239
ever since past three years three and a

1113
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,838
half years so but Ace Infinity is my

1114
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,318
favorite like company but I do work with

1115
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:29,078

manufacturer I'm sponsored by every one

1119
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:39,800
of them because I told you my coming in

1120
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:42,358
I wanted to make this a career so as

1121
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,359
soon as I started as a content creator

1122
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,239
I'm trying to figure out how can I get

1123
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,440
paid to do this and then once I started

1124
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:51,959
growing and people seem to take a liken

1125
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,318
to how I explain things and my voice is

1126
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,599
funny and the way I talk is funny they

1127
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,759
but they people seem to like it then the

1128
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,480
you know the sponsor started hitting

1129
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,440
when I started working with AC Infinity

1130
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,599
that kind of like opened up the

1131
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,519
floodgates for you name them and you can

1132
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,440
use my name on their website and get a

1133
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:10,440
discount yeah I use the AC Infinity

1134
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,318
Lights as well I've got the EVO 3 I've

1135
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,920
got two of those got Evo 6 now and I'll

1136
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:17,079
also got their older well I'm to say

1137
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,760
older lights but their the Halo style

1138
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,960
ones that they call where the the

1139
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,760
opening in the middle I got those twoo

1140
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,199
t22 and T 24s yeah those are they all

1141
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,960
rock they all do really really good job

1142
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:30,598
now since you said you're not measuring

1143
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,480
par how do you determine the light

1144
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,440
distance and the amount to dim the light

1145
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,440
down to that's great the I use the

1146
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,240
manufacturers recommendations you know

1147
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,358
all lights come with the manufacturer

1148
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,959
recommendations and you guys really

1149
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,480
should think about these these companies

1150
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,358
they put a lot of money into R&amp;D

1151
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,079
research and development and they know

1152
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,119
what they're talking about same thing

1153
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:54,240
about I don't know if you were going to

1154
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,240
ask about you know when are we going to

1155
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,919
harvest the plants and that type of deal

1156
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,799
it's the same thing with these breeders

1157
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,280
who are breeding if they're a good

1158
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,839
breeder then they have a recommendation

1159
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,480
on about when you can expect to harvest

1160
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:09,318
so you use that along with looking at

1161
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,920
the tric Combs it's the same thing light

1162
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:15,279
manufacturers if they say 18 in above

1163
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,000
the canopy at 40% then that's what it is

1164
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,760
and then obviously from experience to go

1165
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,358
up a little bit go down a little bit but

1166
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,920
for everybody starting off like

1167
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:26,598
manufacturers recommendation they really

1168
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,838
do put a lot of effort into telling you

1169
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,000
the right information

1170
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,759
and then what do you run for light

1171
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
cycles for veg and flower usually I'm

1172
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,720
I'm 20 and during the uh seeding stage

1173
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,119
I'm 24 hours

1174
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:43,078
on and then once I transplant out of you

1175
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,119
know I'm Red Solo Cup old school with it

1176
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,559
Red Solo Cup until I transplant into

1177
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,160
whatever pot I'm going to transplant

1178
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,720
whenever I transplant them into the veg

1179
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:54,679
pot if you will my veg auto pot then I

1180
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:58,439
when I do 18 and six and then once I hit

1181
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,960
flower 12 and 12 I have done 24 hours

1182
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,760
for the entire veg cycle because you

1183
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,760
know the plants don't need a dark period

1184
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,640
until flower if they're photo period

1185
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,839
plants so I have done that before but I

1186
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,199
just found that that just makes your

1187
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,880
light bill go higher so you might as

1188
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:18,558
well just you and actually I've done 18

1189
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,440
and six from the beginning to but

1190
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,480
usually I'm 24 hours on for the first

1191
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,318
probably like 10 days or so okay that

1192
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,679
makes sense you know one thing I just

1193
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:28,279
want to clarify real quick I think

1194
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:31,199
there's people listening in and they're

1195
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,640
like why is he talking about climate why

1196
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,558
is he talking about lighting I thought

1197
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,039
this was the organic water only method

1198
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,960
why are these things being talked about

1199
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,039
and I just want to clarify that

1200
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,559
variables they're variables that you

1201
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,039
need to factor in when you are

1202
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,319
determining how much nutrition you put

1203
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,159
into the medium right some people think

1204
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,679
it's only about the nutrition how much

1205
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,078
nutrition is going into the medium so

1206
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,519
it's a water only well if you're running

1207
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,119
higher temps than keys if you're running

1208
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:00,480
CO2 and keys isn't running CO2 too well

1209
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,440
then you could have to maybe feed more

1210
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,400
right because your plant is metabolizing

1211
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,079
it's working a little bit harder you

1212
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,400
know so these are things to take into

1213
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,359
consideration and that's why I ask him

1214
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,318
these questions about climate about

1215
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:13,960
lighting and so on and so forth so I

1216
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,599
just wanted to clarify on that one

1217
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,639
that's a that's a great point and also

1218
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,200
you guys take this from somebody who's

1219
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,358
not not been growing that long but I've

1220
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,318
been able to get some people like yo you

1221
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,000
growing High Times magazine type of

1222
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,239
stuff in your bedroom which is crazy I'm

1223
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,280
trying to tell you guys these individual

1224
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:34,598
little points make a big difference you

1225
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,280
think that the the water and the light

1226
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,000
um how far the light is from the canopy

1227
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,359
doesn't make a big difference but as far

1228
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,679
as the quality that you're get you're

1229
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,039
going to get as far as the density of

1230
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,318
your B your your your buds it does make

1231
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,159
a big difference all these little things

1232
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,599
that he's talking about they really add

1233
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,519
up and that's what makes a the

1234
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,599
difference between a okay grower and a

1235
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,599
great grower or a good grower the

1236
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,960
attention to detail that you have so

1237
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,079
even somebody like me that does

1238
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,599
everything very efficient you want to

1239
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,640
make sure that your environment first

1240
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,920
thing is genetics we didn't talk about

1241
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,039
that but it's going to be very hard if

1242
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,559
you don't start with good genetics I

1243
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:12,279
don't care how much of a great grower

1244
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,559
you are bad in equals bad out you know

1245
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,359
you can't start with trash and think

1246
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,519
you're going to get treasure out of it

1247
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,039
so first thing is genetics after that

1248
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,119
that's when it comes to the grower with

1249
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,719
the temperature with humidity with your

1250
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,400
water everything that we're talking

1251
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,159
about for you guys that's doing par and

1252
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,119
EC and PPM whatever it is that you using

1253
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:32,199
to get where you want to get to genetics

1254
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,640
first and then your environment and

1255
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:35,719
that's what's going to give you good

1256
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:38,159
good buds good whatever you're growing

1257
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,000
tomatoes zucchini whatever you're

1258
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,759
growing mushrooms whatever you're

1259
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,480
growing but attention to detail yeah

1260
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,280
exactly yeah there are so many

1261
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,240
misconceptions when it come to Growing

1262
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,119
what would you say are some

1263
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,719
misconceptions about the organic water

1264
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,280
only method that's a great question I

1265
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,639
think one of the the things that I hear

1266
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,280
the most is some people don't want to

1267
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,440
grow grow organic because somehow they

1268
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,359
think that it's harder than synthetic

1269
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,159
that may be for some people for me I

1270
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,199
find it easier because you don't have to

1271
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:10,118
do you know the nutrient ritual that you

1272
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,598
have to do every time that you feed

1273
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:13,240
depending on if you do feed every time

1274
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,000
like we're talking about or feed water

1275
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,358
feed whatever it is but to me it's just

1276
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,400
the easiest way of doing it because

1277
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,639
you're only going to be doing your dry

1278
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Mims every 3 or four weeks other than

1279
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,598
that all you're doing is putting your if

1280
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,119
you're hand watering obviously you're

1281
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,280
hand watering every day but other than

1282
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,240
that if you're using a reservoir you

1283
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,400
just fill up Reservoir once a week or

1284
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:33,399
once every 8 n days depending on you

1285
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,160
know how big your Reservoir is so I

1286
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,039
think probably the biggest misconception

1287
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,799
is that it's harder than synthetic

1288
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,800
another one is some people think for

1289
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:46,680
whatever reason that you don't get great

1290
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,839
tpin unless you use like

1291
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:51,318
synthetic that's not the case at all

1292
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:52,480
with Organic you're going to get great

1293
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:54,838
tarpine

1294
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,159
profile for some people they think that

1295
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,759
you're not going to be getting like a

1296
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,279
lot of Combs I don't know why that is

1297
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,520
some people when I told them I was going

1298
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,319
to grow organic some people like um well

1299
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:10,318
why would you do that you can just use

1300
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:12,199
syn synthetic noes I'm like

1301
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,719
but why do you think that's better I

1302
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,039
don't know why some people think that

1303
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:17,798
growing with synthetically is better or

1304
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:21,000
you're going to get a better result than

1305
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:23,280
growing organically to me it's easier

1306
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,199
it's natural you know what you put into

1307
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,319
it so you know what's coming out of it

1308
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,279
and you get a a great product so I don't

1309
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,318
understand know why some people feel but

1310
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,359
you know this is the internet age and

1311
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:35,318
you heard it on the internet must be

1312
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,719
true and it sounds like he's welcoming

1313
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:42,000
debates in the comment section

1314
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,318
so G to prove him wrong comment below

1315
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,559
organic

1316
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:48,798
sucks where's the Athena oh man that's

1317
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,440
funny okay so a few more questions here

1318
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:53,480
for you beginners right there are a lot

1319
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,159
of folks that are just getting started

1320
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,719
with this method talk to us what advice

1321
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,558
do you have for the beginners that are

1322
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,959
just getting started doing the water

1323
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,079
only organic method I think the the main

1324
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,760
thing

1325
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,920
is just try it just try it one time and

1326
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,559
see if you like it if you're somebody

1327
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,760
who is very busy because there's a lot

1328
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,079
of people that's growing as a hobby you

1329
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,720
know you got work and you got kids and

1330
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,400
you got the your daily life that you got

1331
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:21,639
to worry about I think that organic is

1332
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,358
something that would really work for you

1333
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:24,719
cuz you I'm going to be honest with you

1334
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,039
guys there's a lot of times because I

1335
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,159
have a bunch of different channels and

1336
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,519
and the bigger that you get the more

1337
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,480
opportunities that you get so I'm doing

1338
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:34,519
a lot of different things now and so

1339
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,119
there's sometimes where if you guys

1340
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:37,880
follow my videos then you know that I

1341
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,400
update you every week so if when you

1342
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:44,358
watch my videos you see you know day

1343
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,559
seven veg day 14 veg day 21 veg

1344
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,679
sometimes in between there I don't even

1345
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,359
open up the

1346
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,358
tent I don't even check the plants or

1347
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,159
anything that's what you can do with

1348
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:57,358
Organic because all you're going to be

1349
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:59,480
doing is filling up your Reser with the

1350
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:00,880
water and obviously you know you do have

1351
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,838
to do some defoliation we didn't talk

1352
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,760
about that but we still do our

1353
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:08,119
defoliation I still do

1354
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,720
lollipopping one thing that um I don't

1355
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:13,160
know that we brought up or not I've been

1356
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,879
getting way better results as far as

1357
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:17,519
yield for people woring about yield

1358
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,039
whenever I don't do any training as

1359
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,440
opposed to I got plenty of growths where

1360
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,759
I've put up the trailers we're weaving

1361
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,639
the branches through and everything you

1362
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,240
know you know what the deal is but I'm

1363
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,920
getting a way better yield by just

1364
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:32,279
letting the plants naturally do what it

1365
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,639
does I top them one time and that's it

1366
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,920
so I mean it's really about finding

1367
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:36,239
whatever works for you but I'm trying to

1368
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,480
tell you guys

1369
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:41,959
organic no low stress training just

1370
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,400
lollipop no trellis you know if they

1371
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,039
need to you can use bamboo staks or

1372
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,400
whatever or you can use the trailers to

1373
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,558
hold them up but I'm saying as far as

1374
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,880
training don't do any of that stuff you

1375
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,400
can get a great result just using water

1376
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,838
it's super easy it's like the easiest

1377
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,358
way to grow and for a lot of you guys

1378
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,679
that don't have a Green Thumb you think

1379
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,159
you don't have a green

1380
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:02,759
thumb you should really try this organic

1381
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,920
water only method because it's probably

1382
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,119
going to be the easiest way for you to

1383
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,680
get a successful grou well all right

1384
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,880
there is one more question here that's

1385
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,480
actually a new question I think I'm

1386
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,200
going to start asking people towards the

1387
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,440
end of the episode from here on know

1388
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:16,598
potentially rapid fire what are the top

1389
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,159
three genetics that you've grown top

1390
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,838
three genetics that I've grown when you

1391
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,159
say top three just in my opinion or my

1392
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,440
favor the result that you like you know

1393
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,759
top three that you like for whatever

1394
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,400
reason the the I would have to give not

1395
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,119
in any particular order but the number

1396
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,119
one the first thing that came to my mind

1397
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,798
was the fast buds West Coast OG that's

1398
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,318
because that was my biggest grow as far

1399
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:42,239
as grams and

1400
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:46,199
everything um also I love Square One

1401
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,358
genetics SL robobin Hood seeds THC Titan

1402
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:52,318
wedding cake cross with banana

1403
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:56,519
buttercups Nanz honestly guys pick

1404
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:58,880
anything from from Titan Square One

1405
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,280
Robin Hood seeds I haven't had a bad one

1406
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,798
yet

1407
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,040
and I've grown a lot of his stuff and I

1408
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:07,920
love all of it so any of those anything

1409
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,039
from there and then you know I

1410
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,119
had one of the growths that people know

1411
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:15,519
me for is the utter Madness that I did

1412
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,880
from soulfire Gardens it was the purple

1413
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,239
one and I get a lot of compliments on

1414
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,358
that one so I would probably say

1415
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:27,519
anything from Square One Robin Hood

1416
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:28,558
seeds West Coast OG fast buds so Gardens

1417
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,079
utter

1418
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,240
Madness those probably my favorite ones

1419
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:35,359
that gives the folks some things to look

1420
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,558
out for you know what I mean I know lots

1421
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,440
of people shopping for genetics so yeah

1422
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,040
check out those ones and yeah I can

1423
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,400
vouch for THC Titan as well Square One

1424
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,960
genetics uh he just everything I've

1425
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,079
grown from him has been incredible I had

1426
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,119
him on uh different podcast I was a part

1427
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,519
of back in like 2017 or something I'm

1428
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,920
trying to get him on the garden Talk

1429
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:56,280
podcast he's tough guy to get a hold of

1430
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,760
these days so I may need the audience's

1431
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:02,720
help help here if you can DM him flood

1432
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,200
his uh his comment section or whatever

1433
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,879
and let him know to come on to Garden

1434
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,960
talk he's welcome to come on I'd love to

1435
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,920
have him on because I want talk to him

1436
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,639
about because I think I know I'm biased

1437
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,559
towards me but I really think that if I

1438
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:17,279
could uh create my own strain it would

1439
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:18,839
be something that be very popular I

1440
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,880
appreciate the seeds that you gave me by

1441
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:24,759
the way thank you very much chill out OG

1442
