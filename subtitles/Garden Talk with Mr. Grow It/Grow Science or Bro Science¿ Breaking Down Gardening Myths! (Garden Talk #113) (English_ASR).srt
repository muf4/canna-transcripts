92
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,039
meet you for those of you who we who I

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,319
haven't talked to and certainly I'm

94
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,519
looking forward to hearing from a lot of

95
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,679
people that I've already spoken to um

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm the CEO of rooted Leaf agch we're a

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
carbon based fertilizer manufacturer

98
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,438
that's based in Washington state and um

99
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,199
we've been in business since about 2019

100
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,239
and we've really developed kind of a

101
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,119
unique platform for manufacturing

102
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,158
fertilizers and the idea with what we're

103
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,319
trying to do is treat carbon like a

104
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,798
macronutrient and in the cultivation of

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,359
most crops um food crops and medicinal

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,360
crops it makes a lot of sense to keep

107
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,720
carbon as the number one most important

108
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,599
thing that you as a grower should be

109
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,519
focused on and obviously in the first

110
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,759
episode that we did um I dive into great

111
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,039
detail about that so I would highly

112
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,919
encourage and recommend people go and

113
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,959
check that out if you want a deep dive

114
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,039
into why carbon is the most important

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,079
macronutrient by far yeah we even did an

116
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,679
episode on from the stash quite recently

117
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,920

149
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,280
podcasts in the past and people love it

150
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,759
we're going to be talking about bro

151
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,799
science things that people deem as Bro

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,038
Science and really there's there may or

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
may not be science to back it up but

154
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,000
we're going to go through a whole bunch

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,600
of things here today and uh it's going

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,600
to be fun man I'm excited me too I enjoy

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,280
the sort of the rapid fire approach too

158
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,319
and being able to answer a whole bunch

159
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,439
of seemingly disconnected questions and

160
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,120
by the end of the conversation we'll

161
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,759
actually have a it's like a jigsaw

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,079
puzzle you know the individual pieces

163
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,038
once you start to make sense of it you

164
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,439
kind of see the big picture and that's

165
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:42,560
what I want to try to help people

166
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,240
understand in their Gardens is how do

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,519
you get the most out of anything that

168
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,000
you're growing whether you're growing

169
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,079
roses for competition or you're just

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,560
trying to feed your family and grow some

171
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,399
tomatoes and lettuce in the backyard

172
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,879
hopefully there's going to be some good

173
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,120
content and some of the um myths

174
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,439
misconceptions truths and Hal truths

175
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
that we'll look at today will help

176
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,839
enable enable people people to get

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
better results and achieve a greater

178
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,239
level of success yeah and you have a lot

179
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,198
of knowledge in Biochemistry right so

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
like the chemical processes that happen

181
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,478
in living organisms and to be honest

182
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
with you biochemistry is one of those

183
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,598
things that go over my head and uh I

184
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,399
think it probably goes over a lot of

185
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,240
people has is it's just so so complex

186
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,399
and you do such a great job of grasping

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,360
onto it understanding it and then

188
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,719
relaying it in lay in terms for the

189
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,160
audience so let's start going through

190
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,440
some of these questions and I'm sure

191
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,800
there's going to be a lot of things that

192
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,319
relate to biochemistry that you're going

193
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,560
to be bringing up here so first up grow

194
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,360
light sunrise and sunset feature so it's

195
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,800
often said that hey replicate Nature

196
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,520
Nature has a sunrise they have a sunset

197
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
there's a light spectrum in there that's

198
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,198
different for both of those that's

199
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,759
what's best for the plant so grow lights

200
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,080
now have a sunrise and sunset feature

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,319
now Dr Bruce bugby shout out to him he

202
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,959
actually did a study in regards to the

203
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,520
rate of photosynthesis for a sunrise

204
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,159
sunset versus just turning the lights on

205
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,198
full blast and he had mentioned the

206
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
plants were able to take it full blast

207
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,520
so that's one thing that he kind of

208
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,038
uncovered there in in one study of

209
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,318
course studies need to be repeated in

210
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,478
order for it to be true fact blah blah

211
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,520
blah so on and so forth but sunrise

212
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,839
sunset feature is there any benefit to

213
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,959
this or not I definitely think there is

214
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,799
I think when you're trying to get a

215
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,439
holistic expression of the planet makes

216
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,439
sense to consider that some of the light

217
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,199
energy coming in during those early

218
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,399
morning hours or even in the late

219
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,800
evening um you know it's not primarily

220
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,318
used for photosynth is there are

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,960
wavelengths of light that come in and

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,560
they just kind of help spread a certain

223
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,439
kind of message in the plant so it can

224
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,879
kind of start to express different

225
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,079
things maybe do things like close the

226
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,639
stomata um at night time certainly this

227
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,198
is true um you know typically when

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,439
studies are done on things like this

229
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,960
what they're looking at doing is just

230
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,478
measuring one variable and in this case

231
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,120
it would be let's say Quantum yield or

232
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,199
the the photosynthesis overall in the

233
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,478
plant and when you take just that narrow

234
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,080
slice out of the rest of the plant and

235
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,279
what the rest of the plant is doing um

236
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,639
you know it becomes a little bit more

237
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,559
clear like yeah I mean plants will take

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,158
in the amount of light energy that you

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
give to them and if you just full blast

240
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,199
turn on the lights right away and then

241
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,400
just turn them off at nighttime if

242
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,439
you're only measuring

243
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,318
photosynthesis um you know you'll see

244
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,360
the results skewed from that perspective

245
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,520
but if you're looking at things like

246
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,520
gene expression or even the migration of

247
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,878
the phytochromes from the outermost

248
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,000
layer of the leaf where they are during

249
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,599
the daytime to a little bit closer in

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,598
the nucleus of the cells at night time

251
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,399
there's this physical migration so if

252
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,759
you took a cross-section of a leaf and

253
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,478
looked at it from the side like a

254
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,080
profile shot you'd find that the leaf is

255
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,479
very Dynamic the the um chlorophyll and

256
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,919
most of the pigments that absorb light

257
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,800
energy those are going to be close to

258
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,559
the outer layers of the leaf right and

259
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,079
as you get into the deeper layers of the

260
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,599
leaf more of that light has been

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,639
filtered out and of course on the

262
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,839
underside of the leaf almost all of the

263
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,039
light has been filtered out and the only

264
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,839
thing that's really coming through is a

265
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,958
little bit of green light that's why you

266
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,560
know plants look green effectively from

267
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,599
the underside they also reflect a little

268
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,879
bit of that wavelength of light too but

269
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,680
um you know the the point I'm trying to

270
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,120
make here is that there are

271
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,639
physiological processes that happen that

272
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,360
have been um fine-tuned over the course

273
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,679
of millions if not tens or even hundreds

274
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,159
of millions of years um plants are very

275
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,479
used to the rising and the setting of

276
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,759
the Sun and there's nuanced things that

277
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,200
happen that have to do more with gene

278
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,480
expression and kind of like the big

279
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,079
picture of what a plant is as opposed to

280
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,959
just like hey photosynthesis you know

281
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:27,439
Quantum yield and carbohydrate

282
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,399
production and Calvin cycle these things

283
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,600
are just like tiny components very

284
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,120
important components don't get me wrong

285
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,800
they're kind of like the primary engines

286
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,440
but you have all these accessory things

287
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,838
that um get tagged along with it so I do

288
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,399
think that you know natural sunrise and

289
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,959
sunset um really are going to just help

290
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,519
create a better expression in the plant

291
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,838
overall that makes sense now what if

292
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,839
this grow light just simply Tunes up the

293
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,920
amount of light and doesn't change that

294
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,640
Spectrum to truly simulate sunrise and

295
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,439
sunset would you say that's kind of a a

296
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,480
wasted feature or would you still see

297
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,800
that as being valuable um yeah I think

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,519
there could be value to it for sure um

299
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,000
you know I think to replicate perfectly

300
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,560
what the sun does kind of depends on

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,799
where you are so to speak like if you're

302
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,799
you know in the southern hemisphere

303
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,479
Northern if you're high altitude for

304
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,679
example you might get more UV light

305
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,120
exposure on those plants versus a lower

306
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,799
altitude you might get less so there are

307
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,039
differences for sure and there's no such

308
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,919
thing as a light that can truly

309
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,559
replicate the full spectrum of the sun I

310
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,078
mean the sun sun is just um you know it

311
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,479
operates on a fundamentally different

312
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,679
principle no one really has like a

313
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,079
nuclear reactor that's powering their

314
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,838
grow lights they often times have LEDs

315
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,319
which are totally different in terms of

316
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,120
the mode of operation you know or they

317
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
have high-intensity discharge like metal

318
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,120
highlight and high pressure sodium

319
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,639
lights those things are fundamentally

320
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,120
different um than what the sun is and

321
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,480
how the Sun puts out you know different

322
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,839
wavelengths of energy and really that

323
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
full spectrum I mean it's not just the

324
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,000
visible light spectrum it's you know

325
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,639
infrared for example the planet is

326
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,919
heated by the Sun as well um so there

327
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,278
there are things to consider outside the

328
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,078
context of just what the plant is

329
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,320
capable of absorbing for the purpose of

330
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,559
photosynthesis got it really good points

331
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,360
there now how about the 24-hour light

332
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,119
cycle there's lots of folks who say that

333
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
the plants don't need a resting period

334
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,639
at all they can just blast it with 24

335
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,879
hours of light and the plant will grow

336
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,839
better than if they were on an 186 light

337
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,120
cycle for example people on the opposing

338
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,079
side say no plants do need a resting

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,519
period with the lights off this also

340
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,278
talks about the you know not just the

341
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,120
plants have benefit from lights off but

342
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,919
the microbes in the medium as well need

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,039
that resting period what's your take on

344
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,439
that yeah and I think it kind of stems

345
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,919
from the same um issue overall as when

346
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,360
we're looking at things from just that

347
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,399
scientific perspective it tends to we we

348
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,320
get this very narrow slice and so

349
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,559
photosynthesis is like a car engine for

350
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,800
example and all the byproducts all the

351
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,000
things that you want your plants to

352
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,399
produce all the wonderful Aromas and

353
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,200
fragrances and flavorful compounds and

354
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
things like that those are driven by

355
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,480
light

356
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,759
um but it's much like a car engine yes

357
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,120
you get more horsepower if you leave

358
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,679
your car running for 24 hours a day but

359
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
in reality sometimes you have to let

360
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,120
that you got to turn the engine off so

361
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,879
that the accessory belts and everything

362
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,399
else doesn't like get burned out and get

363
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,198
worn down um the same thing is true for

364
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,078
plants as well because they've evolved

365
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,599
to capture energy from the Sun during

366
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,000
the day and then during the night

367
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,320
they're not necessarily uh inactive it's

368
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,720
not like the plants go to sleep they're

369
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,760
actually still very metabolically active

370
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
and a lot of the activity associated

371
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,559
with plants at nighttime revolves around

372
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,638
taking the sugars that they've produced

373
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,599
throughout the day and doing things like

374
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,360
maybe maintaining their own internal

375
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,199
temperatures maybe feeding some

376
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,639
beneficial microbes and fungi um there's

377
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:46,120
also something to be said about um the

378
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,799
stamata and the way that the water flows

379
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,959
in the plants this is maybe a little bit

380
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,278
more minor of a difference but you know

381
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,439
when the when the lights are on or when

382
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,240
the sun is out plants are taking up

383
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,480
water from the roots and transpiring it

384
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,440
from through the leaves um when the

385
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,000
lights turn off and the sun sets the

386
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
stomat on the leaves close and so you

387
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
have this reversal of a pressure

388
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,279
gradient meaning that the water from the

389
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,079
roots is no longer flowing up like it is

390
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,198
when the stomato are open when they

391
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,239
close actually what ends up happening is

392
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:16,519
the roots can actually secrete organic

393
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
acids and all the byproducts of

394
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,278
photosynthesis during the day the roots

395
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,799
will actually push that stuff back out

396
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,600
into the surrounding medium which is the

397
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,719
rizosphere that narrow like 1 to 2 mm

398
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,560
just outside the root hairs and it's

399
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,480
this secretion of the root exit states

400
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,559
that attract the microbes attract the

401
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,399
fungi and that's really where the plant

402
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,559
can kind of modulate its relationship

403
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,679
with those microorganisms to help

404
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,958
optimize the chemistry of whatever is

405
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:46,078
going on um so you know it is important

406
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,879
in my perspective to maintain that that

407
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,319
Synergy with what plants have been doing

408
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,000
for so long anyways because a lot of

409
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
times when you start hybridizing plants

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,480
particularly those are that are grown in

411
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,720
indoor controlled environment kind of

412
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,480
scenarios you know they get really

413
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,040
sensitive to certain types of

414
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,360
environmental stressors I mean yes you

415
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,000
can run your engine 24 hours a day but

416
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,919
the moment you flick the timing belt the

417
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,120
whole thing just snaps and breaks apart

418
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,639
so this is similar to how certain you

419
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,679
know crops when they're growing indoors

420
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,440
in controlled environments you you know

421
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,000
the the stability of them tends to go

422
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
down over time so if you have like a

423
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,320
dehumidifier in the room for example and

424
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,838
it puts off a blue light just a tiny

425
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,079
tiny little amount of light that can be

426
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,160
enough to trigger something in the plant

427
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,879
that makes it become stressed out and

428
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,319
and give you different results than what

429
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,000
you're looking for maybe you know the

430
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,440
plant starts to um go kind of down this

431
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,159
path as opposed to the other path that

432
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,040
you wanted to go down so these things

433
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,240
typically don't happen in nature because

434
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,599
there is a moon out there in nature and

435
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
even during a full moon a lot of the

436
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,440
genetics that are just like wild growing

437
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
um they don't respond negatively they

438
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,240
don't have these stress responses they

439
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,120
don't have their photo periods disrupted

440
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,198
by the tiny tiny little amount of light

441
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,919
the that the moon reflect so I feel like

442
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,120
a lot of the sensitivities and a lot of

443
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,000
the instabilities that have been created

444
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,839
over time have been artificially

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
selected for so to speak because a lot

446
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,920
of people don't understand what they're

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,480
doing when they run their car engine for

448
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,078
24 hours a day and then they wonder why

449
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,759
the belts are starting to get worn down

450
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,399
and everything is starting to break and

451
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,959
it's just wear and tear you know that

452
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,839
type of thing so what's your personal

453
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,758
recommendation for light cycle for the

454
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,839
vegetation stage and then recommendation

455
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,440
for light cycle for the flower stage

456
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,040
well it depends on where the gene pool

457
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,079
comes from I think if you're growing

458
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,919
something you know closer to the Equator

459
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,879
they can handle longer uh periods of

460
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,599
daylight shorter periods of um you know

461
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,439
the dark dark

462
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,839
period um but if you're growing

463
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,519
something that's maybe a little bit more

464
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,560
Northern or a little bit more Southern

465
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,919
probably something closer to like 186

466
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,198
would be pretty good you know 18 hours

467
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,799
on 6 hours off um you know in some cases

468
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,519
20 hours on 4 hours off I do think that

469
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,198
there's a real benefit associated with

470
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,519
having that dark period for regardless

471
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,519
of what you're growing or how you're

472
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,318
growing and I I do think that there's a

473
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,000
benefit and a value associated with that

474
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,639
dark period um but the the it is a

475
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,958
little bit plast you know there's some

476
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
plasticity because it also depends on

477
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,599
how much your plants are capable of

478
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,078
handling if you give them really really

479
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,560
good air flow and the VPD is always in

480
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:14,078
that perfect spot and the soil chemistry

481
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:16,239
is just right and the light intensity is

482
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,078
perfect but not too much plants can

483
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,360
Cruise along at that optimal spot for a

484
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,078
lot longer versus if you have the lights

485
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,680
just a little bit too intense they

486
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,719
quickly become saturated and maybe you

487
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,318
know if you have your lights on for 18

488
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,240
hours you might start to notice right

489
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,958
around 12 to 14 hours your plants almost

490
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
look like they're not sad but they start

491
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,078
to like get a little droopy or like

492
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,439
they're getting ready to go to sleep

493
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,399
because they're kind of reaching that

494
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,600
point where the equilibrium is being

495
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,318
thrown off and they're kind of um trying

496
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,440
to catch up to the strats rather than

497
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,360
string staying ahead of it and being

498
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,680
able to deal with it so when the leaves

499
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,720
droop towards the end of the light cycle

500
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,958
are you saying that there is an

501
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,120
indication that something is wrong or is

502
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,159
that a natural thing that happens with

503
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,000
all of these medicinal plants is they'll

504
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,759
dro down before the light cycle

505
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,078
naturally um in some cases it could mean

506
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,078
that it's too much light yeah you you'd

507
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:06,720
want to take a look at the you know

508
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,759
visual morphology of the plants to see

509
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,120
if you have any burned Leaf tips you

510
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,078
know that's a that's a big one in

511
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,119
particular plants if the transpiration

512
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,639
is a little bit off and they get

513
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,678
stressed out um if they are a little bit

514
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,160
too dry for example you know they'll

515
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,640
tend to have those burned Leaf tips um

516
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,798
and it could be a sign of too much light

517
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,480
intensity I would say to some extent it

518
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,480
is natural for the plants to want to go

519
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,000
through those day and night cycles just

520
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,679
like plants want to go through wet dry

521
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,599
Cycles you know they like being really

522
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,480
saturated lots of water available but

523
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,119
only for a very short amount of time you

524
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,679
know most plants you can't grow fully so

525
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,918
the roots cannot be fully submerged they

526
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,798
can be exposed to a large amount of

527
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,759
water but for a short amount of time and

528
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,279
then they kind of go the pendulum swings

529
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,400
the other way and they start to the soil

530
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,720
becomes much drier for example and The

531
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
Roots start to dry out and these W dry

532
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,600
Cycles are very um advantageous to

533
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,678
plants because it allows them to balance

534
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,038
their chemistry and their metabolism out

535
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,280
I think the same thing is true of day

536
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:03,798
and night cycles for sure the plants do

537
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,678
have this tendency to kind of go back

538
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,679
through and create a balance in that

539
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,840
swing um if you optimize the grow

540
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,919
environment and you optimize the

541
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,639
chemistry of the plants the leaves will

542
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,440
typically not um droop like that they'll

543
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,200
stay kind of nice and perky and active

544
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,519
um and so you can in those situations

545
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,279
you can push the plants a little bit

546
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,558
harder maybe a higher light intensity um

547
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,440
but you know it's also true that plants

548
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,839
have circadian rhythms a lot of these

549
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,600
plants are really looking towards the

550
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:34,000
not only the um you know exposure to the

551
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,759
sun itself but also the duration of the

552
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,919
day versus the night as a mechanism or a

553
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,400
trigger for that flowering process and

554
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,960
it can also factor in temperature as

555
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,200
well for certain um plants like hops for

556
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,600
example um you need to hit particular

557
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,038
temperatures in order to actually

558
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,879
initiate um flowering in hop species got

559
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,158
it how about darkness before Harvest uh

560
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,200
this is something that a lot of folks

561
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,880
have done over the years I've heard

562
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,200
benefits everything from more tricomes

563
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
are produced secondary metabolites

564
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,240
ripening there's so many different

565
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,719
things that are said in regards to

566
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,720
giving you your plant a period of

567
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,079
darkness before Harvest is giving your

568
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,600
plants a period of darkness before

569
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,879
Harvest beneficial at all I would say

570
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,959
largely probably not when you look at

571
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,919
the underlying mechanics of how um

572
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,480
certain compounds can be produced like

573
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,200
the monotes and sasines things like that

574
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,880
um you know THC CBD all these compounds

575
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,240
they're very energy intensive compounds

576
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,960
which is why they require exposure to

577
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,359
direct light you know if you're growing

578
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,960
some of these plants in a you know like

579
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,199
far away from the light under low light

580
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,679
intensity with low pressure and low

581
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,759
stress overall you're probably not going

582
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,519
to get the best results but if you have

583
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,640
a high-intensity grower environment with

584
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,558
high-intensity lights that light energy

585
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,640
is directly what feeds those

586
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:51,918
biosynthetic Pathways and so by cutting

587
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,600
out that light energy entirely you're

588
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,320
actually directly bottlenecking the

589
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,959
process and instead of creating a

590
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,519
greater throughput in that particular

591
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,880
path way you you might stimulate the

592
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,558
plant to respond in a particular way but

593
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,400
it's not going to be the the type of

594
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,240
response that's fundamentally hardwired

595
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,159
and linked to the light energy coming in

596
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
and then being utilized through a very

597
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,320
complex process obviously photosynthesis

598
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
first and then those sugars being

599
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,359
transported broken down and then you

600
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,919
know the turpine synthes enzymes acting

601
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,240
on them and polyketide synthes enzymes

602
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,919
acting on them too to create ol ofic

603
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,720
acid um these things are fundamentally

604
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,159
driven by exposure to life so I would

605
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,679
say that it's a little bit of a

606
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,360
misconception or a myth however there

607
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,640
are um examples of you know some

608
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,359
compounds that might be produced by the

609
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,720
plants which create a little bit more

610
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,839
rounder or nuanced experience maybe this

611
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,759
is more for people who are connoisseurs

612
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,079
and aren't necessarily just seeking a

613
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,720
high concentration of active metabolites

614
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,918
but they want that broad spectrum of

615
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
metabolites um there could be something

616
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,320
there but it would be largely a personal

617
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
bias more than like an objectively true

618
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,720
thing um I think it's objectively true

619
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,600
to say that you would probably um see a

620
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,360
decrease in the overall concentration of

621
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,279
some of these metabolites particularly

622
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,479
because again their biosynthesis and

623
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,319
accumulation is tied directly to the

624
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
light energy that's coming in and if you

625
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,480
break that no way got it that makes

626
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,520
sense and just a quick note a lot of

627
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,440
these questions actually came from the

628
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,240
audience so shout out to those folks

629
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,440
that have followed me on Instagram ATM

630
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,839
mr. grit that's the only account I have

631
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,159
on Instagram just uh FYI there are a lot

632
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,199
of impersonator accounts on that

633
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,080
platform unfortunately but I asked this

634
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
question about what Gard mths they've

635
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,278
heard or broscience things and tons of

636
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,240
people had submitted things in so this

637
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,319
is kind of like a Consolidated list of

638
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,038
not only things that people have

639
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,359
submitted in couple of them I have

640
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:44,599
thought up couple of them you had

641
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,959
actually mentioned that you wanted to

642
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,439
talk about so um just wanted to mention

643
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,440
that there and some of the questions

644
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,360
have been asked to other guests in other

645
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,278
episodes in the past but definitely want

646
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,038
to get Nick's Insight on these as well

647
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,759
so another thing that people do before

648
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,000
harvesting is they flush their plants

649
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,960
run water through the medium or they

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,359
will simply cut off nutrients they won't

651
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,519
feed nutrients for the final one to two

652
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,918
weeks before Harvest some people go even

653
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,839
longer than that now there have been a

654
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,679
couple studies on flushing Arc screen

655
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
technology study comes to mind for me

656
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,798
where they really found no difference

657
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,038
between flushed and unflushed buds give

658
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,440
me some insight on your end does

659
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,319
flushing your plants before Harvest

660
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,200
provide any benefits it's a little bit

661
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,519
of a myth and a misconception you know

662
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,159
if you think about how things work out

663
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,440
in nature plants don't necessarily have

664
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,000
a choice to stop taking things up it's

665
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,640
really about how they metabolize the

666
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,159
various elements and how those relate to

667
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,840
carbon metabolism in the first episode

668
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,440
that we did we had kind of tied all of

669
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,240
the macronutrients like the npks and the

670
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,519
calciums and magnesium so on and so

671
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,880
forth um to what plants are trying to

672
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,639
achieve because all of it just

673
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
ultimately comes to carbon metabolism

674
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,200
and I really feel like a lot of Growers

675
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,720
are leaving yield and quality on the

676
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,759
table if they're cutting nutrients out

677
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,960
too soon because this whole flushing

678
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,720
process is a little bit of a miscon

679
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,759
conception from that perspective of

680
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
you're going to get an increase in

681
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,038
potency or you're going to get an

682
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,200
increase in quality um that's generally

683
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,960
speaking not the way it works um and

684
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,759
then even furthermore if the goal is to

685
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
flush some kind of residual salts away

686
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,079
from the roots to prevent them from

687
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,919
being taken up or whatever um it would

688
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,439
actually be a beneficial practice to

689
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,520
incorporate a small amount of um some

690
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,679
potassium that has organic acids

691
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,480
associated with it because those organic

692
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,038
acids can directly participate in these

693
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,759
types of salt Bing and detoxifying

694
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,119
processes that I think a lot of Growers

695
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,640
seek when they add just plain water into

696
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,918
the medium um the other thing to

697
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,799
consider too is that the constant flow

698
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,080
of some of these minerals working their

699
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,158
way into the plant is very very

700
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,599
important for that long uh for that

701
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,720
long-term sort of stability of the the

702
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,240
the flow or the you know the whatever

703
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,919
product it is that you're whatever plant

704
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
it is that you're trying to grow um

705
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,440
getting a little bit of calcium getting

706
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,639
a little bit of potassium in with every

707
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,640
single watering is going to help with

708
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,440
certain things like Gene Express I

709
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,960
charge conductance and if the plants are

710
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,159
doing you know photosynthesis during the

711
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,798
last couple of days um or even the last

712
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,520
couple of weeks of their

713
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,359
life um a lot of the carbon that flows

714
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,879
through the plant from photosynthesis

715
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,678
plants are looking towards some of these

716
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,039
minerals to help create a little bit of

717
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,519
a charge balance between them so

718
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,000
potassium is actually a really good one

719
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,918
to talk about in that uh from that

720
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,480
perspective because if you feed

721
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,679
potassium to your plants during the mid

722
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,440
to late stages of flowering you're

723
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,759
actually increasing the overall appetite

724
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,759
that the plant has for taking CO2 out of

725
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,359
the air and this directly and you know

726
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,519
in conjunction with light obviously this

727
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,278
directly impacts the overall production

728
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,278
of tpin and um other compounds that

729
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,798
people might want from their plants

730
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,159
that's interesting I didn't know that

731
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,720
ice flushing this relates to what we

732
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,159
just talked about with flushing now ice

733
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,600
flushing for those that don't know is

734
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,960
really just taking bunch of ice dumping

735
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,079
it on top of the medium before Harvest

736
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,278
letting that ice melt cold water down in

737
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,639
the root Zone

738
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:02,558
and it is said that this actually

739
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
stresses the plants into making more

740
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:07,158
secondary metabolites tricomes for

741
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,759
example and it also brings out purple

742
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,039
color is there any truth to any of that

743
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,398
yeah I would say that the antoin which

744
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:16,679
is the purple pigments you know the

745
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:18,239
biosythesis of them can be tied to um

746
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,519
exposure to cold and I think part of

747
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
what it has to do is like plants have

748
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,119
membranes that are that are like

749
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,559
phospholipids and if you've ever taken a

750
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,879
glass of cold water and added a drop of

751
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,798
oil into it the temperature of the water

752
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,440
forces the coalesence of the oil so you

753
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,720
get this like distinct glob or drop of

754
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,360
oil that floats on top um whereas if you

755
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
have a glass of warm water and you drop

756
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,398
oil inside of it that oil could disperse

757
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,599
a little bit more evenly across the top

758
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:46,759
so it tends to like stretch out and it

759
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:50,199
tends to not just Clump up together like

760
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,038
this you know um when you put ice on the

761
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,399
soil and Ice flush your plants really

762
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,798
what you're doing is exposing them to

763
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,119
cold temperatures that create a sort of

764
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:58,798
brittleness if you will with the

765
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,918
phospholes lipids because again these

766
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,720
are these are phosph lipids they're oils

767
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,200
they're they're you know fats

768
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,079
basically um and the plants defensive

769
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,880
mechanism is it doesn't want that fat to

770
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,798
kind of coales like that because for

771
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,799
their cell wall membranes for example or

772
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:14,918
for the Integrity of these membranes

773
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,879
it's really important for them to be

774
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,720
able to kind of stretch out and maintain

775
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,600
that adequate reach that they have

776
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,159
across the the full volume or surface

777
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,158
area of wherever they're located um and

778
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,159
so antoin which are those purple

779
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,760
pigments can be produced by plants

780
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,278
because they'll kind of modify the

781
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,798
properties of those phospholipids a

782
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:33,558
little bit they'll allow them to be

783
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,038
exposed to colder temperatures without

784
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:38,398
necessarily becoming so brittle and

785
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,119
cracking if you will and that's um

786
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:43,319
that's an important consideration but um

787
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,038
ultimately I think putting I you know

788
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,759
the ice water fles thing I think it can

789
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,240
actually do more harm than good for a

790
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,679
couple of reasons one is that anytime

791
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,480
that we're talking about that purple

792
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,240
pigment being synthesized those antoin

793
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,480
directly compete for

794
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,679
substrates um with you know like CBD and

795
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,240
THC and some of these other molecules um

796
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,960
there's a competition between the two of

797
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,319
them so you have a building block that

798
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,399
either gets diverted to make a purple

799
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:12,678
pigment or it gets diverted to make

800
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:13,759
something called olic acid um and there

801
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,880
there's a little bit of cross talk

802
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,679
between them so they kind of get

803
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,440
balanced out but the idea is that plants

804
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,880
are taking in CO2 from the environment

805
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,679
around them and the real question is

806
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,200
where does that carbon go because if the

807
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,480
carbon goes towards making a purple

808
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,038
pigment it could have instead gone

809
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,240
towards making a monot turpine or or a

810
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:32,398
sasquat turpine or maybe some CBD um or

811
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,319
other

812
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,839
canabo um and so it becomes a little bit

813
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,359
of a problem in that context the other

814
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,398
reason that it could be an issue is

815
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,639
because when you have really cold

816
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,959
temperatures uh in the feed water you

817
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,480
know if you're exposing your plants to

818
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,038
that it's the flow of energy coming in

819
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,720
through photosynthesis typically that

820
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,200
energy comes in and you want to get your

821
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
plants to express all of those wonderful

822
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
colors and flavors and Aromas that you

823
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,399
possibly can but when you expose your

824
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,000
plants to low temperatures what ends up

825
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,038
happening is that energy actually gets

826
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,359
diverted away from the production of

827
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:08,599
secondary metabolites and it instead

828
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,639
becomes uncoupled from ATP generation

829
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,359
and there's something called

830
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,278
thermogenesis which is just generation

831
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,519
of heat you know the the Practical sort

832
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,640
of application here might be like every

833
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,880
time that you eat a meal you might

834
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,919
notice your body temperature actually

835
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,760
goes up a little bit um and this is

836
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,200
possible to measure I think it's been

837
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,158
done a number of times but when you eat

838
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,798
food your body's breaking that food down

839
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,320
and is releasing that energy just as

840
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,879
heat because your body needs to maintain

841
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:34,119
a particular temperature in order to

842
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,559
operate efficiently homeostasis is what

843
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,479
this is called so maintaining the

844
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:39,240
optimum temperature to allow all the

845
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,599
enzymes in your body to function all the

846
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,000
proteins to work properly and really you

847
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,959
know you don't want cold and brittle

848
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,079
joints like some people might notice

849
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,038
this if they have really sensitive

850
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,639
joints when the temperatures go down the

851
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,558
joints become really stiff and the

852
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,080
joints become really sensitive and this

853
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,558
is part of the same phenomena in Plants

854
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,839
meaning that if they're exposed to cold

855
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,200
temperatures that are below their

856
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,199
threshold instead of taking that energy

857
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,759
from the Sun and producing compounds

858
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,798
with it they'll take the energy from the

859
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,558
Sun and produce heat with it and the

860
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,960
goal of producing heat is to raise the

861
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,359
temperature of the water that they've

862
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,440
been exposed to so that it becomes

863
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,199
sufficient for their basic operation and

864
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,320
that's always just an energy tax placed

865
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,080
on the plant so I would say ice flushing

866
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,839
is probably not um very beneficial it

867
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,439
does slow down total transpiration in

868
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,000
Plants it does decrease the availability

869
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,919
of nutrients you know if you've got a

870
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,798
cold glass of water versus a hot glass

871
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,120
of water you can fit a lot more sugar

872
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,359
inside of that hot glass of water you

873
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,798
can add teaspoon after teaspoon and keep

874
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,839
stirring and that hot water will

875
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,440
dissolve all of that Sugar way more

876
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,839
effectively than a glass of cold water

877
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,679
is going to dissolve that same amount of

878
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,599
sugar and plants are faced with the same

879
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,720
problem they take CO2 out of the air and

880
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,359
they're trying to create sugars and in

881
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,038
order for those sugars to be properly

882
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,918
dissolved inside of their own tissues it

883
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,640
requires the water to be at a particular

884
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,919
temperature and plants are very heavily

885
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,759
invested in maintaining that um

886
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
temperature you know margin because they

887
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,599
don't have the ability to just put on

888
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,798
another layer or or jacket if they get

889
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,959
too cold or they can't like stand up and

890
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,440
walk somewhere else where it's a little

891
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,360
bit more ideal they have to deal with

892
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,519
the environment that they're exposed to

893
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,519
and if that environment is cold their

894
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,960
primary focus becomes less generate heat

895
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,558
psycher metabolites are useless without

896
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,440
a functional cell to begin with you know

897
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:22,759
the the primary purpose at that moment

898
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,679
in time is going to be for the plant to

899
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,240
take the energy from the Sun and create

900
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,600
heat which is a problem when you're

901
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,720
trying to create colors and flavors and

902
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,199
Aromas and all these things another

903
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,278
thing that's doing is it's really

904
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,440
slowing down your microbes right the

905
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:39,200
lower the temp the slower the microbes

906
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,759
function and if you're relying on the

907
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
microbes in order to break down organic

908
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,679
matter and cycle nutrients so the plant

909
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,079
can uptake it well you're kind of

910
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,559
slowing down that process by adding ice

911
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:51,079
water into your medium there I

912
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,599
personally what I usually do to bring

913
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,558
out the colors towards the end of

914
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,879
flowering is I'll just lower the ambient

915
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:00,599
temp you know the the room temp into the

916
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,440
low 60s high 50s degree Fahrenheit and

917
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,480
that uh that usually does help bring out

918
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,679
some of the colors I would think that

919
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,038
might be a better approach to bring out

920
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,720
the colors if that's kind of your goal

921
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,839
is to kind of get some colors out of it

922
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,880
doing that route instead of doing the

923
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,918
ice flushing yeah yeah and there's that

924
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,278
antifreeze sort of mechanism that we

925
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,960
talked about too you know just dropping

926
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,480
the temperatures a little bit will um

927
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,000
create a little shock in the plants and

928
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,720
they have a vested interest in not only

929
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,319
um offsetting the temperature changes

930
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,480
but also producing compounds that can

931
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,839
help them deal with or mitigate that

932
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,278
kind of stress so um that's where the

933
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,879
purple pigments start to come in they

934
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,599
can modify the way that some of these

935
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960
compounds behave at really low

936
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,558
temperatures like those those fatty

937
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,440
acids and those oils which tend to just

938
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,079
kind of Clump up and come all together

939
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,798
this is not an ideal state for all of

940
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,759
your cells to be in because you want

941
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,638
your cells to take up a large surface

942
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,839
area large you want that plasticity you

943
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:53,359
want that cell to be able to kind of

944
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,199
move around and expand because there's

945
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,000
always water coming in during the day

946
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,639
the vacul fill up as the roots take that

947
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,278
water water up so you want the cell to

948
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:02,519
be able to expand and then also to

949
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:03,638
contract once the water leaves the vacu

950
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,558
and then gets destined for

951
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:07,759
photosynthesis or for transpiration but

952
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,440
this constant like water pump phenomena

953
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,079
where the plants are swelling up as they

954
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,519
fill up with water and then they're kind

955
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,879
of shrinking back down as they um as

956
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,079
that water leaves the vacuum you want to

957
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,840
maintain this Dynamic with plants and at

958
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,359
really cold temperatures the outer

959
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,798
layers become very brittle and it

960
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:24,839
becomes difficult for the plants to

961
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,359
effectively expand without cracking the

962
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,480
you know outer layers of the cell walls

963
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,719
and don't like that because you know it

964
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,038
starts to create oxidative damage it

965
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,319
starts to you know destroy the cells and

966
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,558
the organel so they produce these purple

967
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:41,158
pigments that modify those phospholipids

968
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,599
and even at low temperatures now the

969
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,399
plant can properly go through this

970
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,359
expansion and contraction process good

971
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:50,759
info let's move right along here next up

972
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,398
we have stem splitting so some people

973
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,440
actually split the the stem or the stock

974
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,359
during the grow typically it's a little

975
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,798
bit before harvest in order to stress

976
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,000
the plant into producing more tricomes

977
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:04,398
does that actually work I don't think so

978
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,159
um you know it kind of depends on what

979
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,439
flavor of Tricom we're talking about

980
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,000
there's a couple of different ones um

981
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,000
you know there's the ones that have

982
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,759
heads on them with the stocks there's

983
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,759
ones that have just the stocks with no

984
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,599
heads there's ones that are just the

985
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,519
heads sitting on the surface of the leaf

986
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,638
with no stocks and then there's some

987
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,359
that are non- glandular tricomes that

988
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:27,398
are either phytolith uh deposits like if

989
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,158
you grow cucumbers or if you grow

990
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:32,119
tomatoes those pokey little um spines

991
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,600
that grow all up along the stock and

992
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,000
particularly for some varietal of

993
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,278
cucumber they can actually form on the

994
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,359
fruit itself those are cystoliths if

995
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,240
they're calcium carbonate deposits and

996
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,759
they're phytoliths if they're some kind

997
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,759
of uh silica deposits so for plants that

998
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,879
take up a lot large concentration of

999
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,119
silicon zucchini and squash or good

1000
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,880
examples of plants that can do this

1001
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,678
they'll actually secrete those and make

1002
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,278
non- glandular tricomes and those serve

1003
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,360
defensive purposes as well so I would

1004
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,319
say if you're talking about in the

1005
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,638
context of glandular tricomes the ones

1006
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,558
that have the stocks and the heads it's

1007
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,719
probably not going to increase the

1008
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,638
biosynthesis of them there are a couple

1009
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,398
of studies that are coming out that

1010
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:10,239
particularly done on like hops for

1011
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,480
lupulin glands then also on lavender

1012
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,078
buds which produce a large large

1013
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,838
concentration of lolu and merine you

1014
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,879
know aamine campine these tpin might be

1015
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:23,039
quite familiar um to your audience you

1016
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,519
know lavender buds has been shown that

1017
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,119
um there's a phenomena that happens in

1018
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,000
the early stages of flowering where and

1019
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,519
this may not be true for all plants but

1020
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,358
effectively the idea is that the plant

1021
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,719
is in the first 2 to 3 weeks of

1022
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,679
flowering the plant's trying to figure

1023
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,598
out which of its tricomes are going to

1024
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,240
be the ones with the heads and with the

1025
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,480
stocks coming off of it and it starts to

1026
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,239
dedicate resources really early on

1027
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,199
because plants are Master mathematicians

1028
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,319
they really really good at doing math

1029
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,279
and they're really good for planning

1030
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,599
ahead they're always trying to build uh

1031
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
an understanding of what's right around

1032
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,359
the corner you know they're trying to

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,039
build up stockpiles of energy so they

1034
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,960
can deal with changes in the environment

1035
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,000
things like that but all this ultimately

1036
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,599
to say that the presence of these um you

1037
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
know the bulbus the capitate stock

1038
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,519
tricomes is what they're called but the

1039
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,639
ones that have heads on them the

1040
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,719
decision to make those is made several

1041
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,039
weeks in advance before it actually

1042
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,519
extends Off The Leaf surface and becomes

1043
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,440
an actual stocked Tricom with a head on

1044
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,320
it so the plant's trying to plan and and

1045
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,280
try to figure these things out pretty

1046
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,000
early on in the process so to do it just

1047
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,440
before Harvest um doesn't really give

1048
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,079
the plants enough time to adjust

1049
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,838
properly because as far as the

1050
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,519
expression goes um of the plant you know

1051
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,559
they make these decisions several weeks

1052
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,838
in advance before it actually happens

1053
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,799
that's why I think focusing on what

1054
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,440
happens in the first two to 3 weeks of

1055
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,760
flowering can actually set the plants up

1056
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,240
for success for the second half of

1057
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,000
flowering so you can get the best

1058
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,358
possible results um and to you know

1059
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,599
answer the question more directly or

1060
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,719
more specifically I I don't think that

1061
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,960
it would be directly connected to an

1062
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,239
increase in yield or quality you may see

1063
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,318
some tpin come out or not TP I'm sorry

1064
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,799
you may see some tricomes come up but

1065
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,079
those may not be the ones that become

1066
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,680
concentrated in oils those may be more

1067
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,960
defensive compounds like the non-

1068
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,559
glandular tricomes or even the ones that

1069
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,079
don't have heads they're just the stocks

1070
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,480
that come out yeah cuz they Tri con form

1071
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,400
right but in order for it to get that

1072
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,159
potency takes a little while right what

1073
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,920
what's the uh timeline on that like when

1074
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,399
a Trion was formed typically you're

1075
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,639
about going from clear to cloudy to

1076
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,920
Amber what's the general timeline for

1077
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,480
that transition well it kind of depends

1078
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,318
on I mean it could take several weeks um

1079
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,838
you know the transition between uh

1080
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:37,239
particularly when you're going from like

1081
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,759
cloudy to Amber it's really the when the

1082
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,399
color starts to form inside of those

1083
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,880
triome heads that there's an indication

1084
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,960
of some change in the chemistry and

1085
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
sometimes what could be happening is the

1086
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,440
compounds that are inside of that triome

1087
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,318
head could be um starting to oxidize and

1088
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,400
as they oxidize the color will change a

1089
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:55,679
little bit and a lot of Growers will

1090
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,119
look at this as a sign of maturity like

1091
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,598
the plant is ready to be harvested um

1092
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,800
there are certainly cases where like if

1093
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,920
you feed the correct things to your

1094
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,599
plants if you have a dialed in

1095
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,039
fertilizer program your plants will

1096
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,800
inherently be able to resist that

1097
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,960
oxidative stress so they may develop

1098
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,160
those Tricom heads more rapidly in the

1099
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,559
first let's say half of flowering

1100
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,440
they're going to like develop them a lot

1101
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,880
faster and the flowers will grow out a

1102
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,838
lot more but then when the triom heads

1103
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
themselves are starting to to become a

1104
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,000
little bit more cloudy and milky they'll

1105
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,200
hang out in that transitionary space

1106
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,960
between being clear and being Amber for

1107
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,239
a lot longer so they'll resist the

1108
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,720
degradation associated with that that

1109
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,799
ambering effect you know they'll go

1110
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,239
through the first half really rapidly

1111
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,440
but then for the second half it takes

1112
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,000
them forever seemingly forever to finish

1113
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,559
up and to um properly oxidize so you see

1114
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,039
that color change happening um a lot of

1115
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,078
what happens inside of the Tricom heads

1116
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,358
as far as like the change of you know

1117
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,440
the constituents and what those

1118
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,480
molecules are inside of there those are

1119
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,838
driven by non-enzymatic processes

1120
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,800
meaning it's not something ins inside of

1121
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:00,440
the plant that's actually causing this

1122
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,519
discoloration It's actually an

1123
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,720
environmental stressor and I think it it

1124
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,559
makes sense to pay attention to certain

1125
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,799
plants like hops for example it's a

1126
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,239
really good example of a plant with um

1127
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
it has brackets on the outside of the

1128
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,279
flowering cone and then the lupulin

1129
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,480
glands actually face inward there are

1130
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,119
other plants um Tomatoes may be a good

1131
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,159
one as well where the tricomes actually

1132
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,838
pointed out you know if you look at the

1133
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,318
the stocks and um Leaf surfaces of

1134
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,920
tomatoes you'll see that those tricomes

1135
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:28,920
are actually exposed to the to the

1136
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,519
surrounding environment um that's an

1137
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,800
important consideration too cuz when

1138
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,960
you're just exposed to the Out outdoors

1139
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,119
with no protective sheath like hop cones

1140
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,159
have that the bra itself is an actual

1141
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,519
physical sheet that protects it you're

1142
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,480
more likely to get oxidative

1143
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,239
decomposition just cuz it's exposed to

1144
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,000
the air you know that's good to know all

1145
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,879
right moving right along this next one

1146
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,318
is actually from a viewer I got a little

1147
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,318

you can ask questions in there but

1157
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,560
canabas 420 posted about carbonated

1158
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,118
water and whether or not it's beneficial

1159
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:21,000
so I'm going to read off his scenario

1160
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,079
here and then uh you can give me some

1161
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,318
insight on it so he had mentioned that

1162
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,440
he uses carbonated water to water his

1163
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:33,199
plants and carbonated water lowers the

1164
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,800
pH drastically to four to 6 pH he had to

1165
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,439
up the pH to over 10 pH to get close to

1166
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,920
his liking so he dumped a bunch of pH Up

1167
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,960
in there and was wondering if that's

1168
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,280
safe to use also wondering when the

1169
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,720
carbonation wears off will the water's

1170
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,680
pH shoot back up to 10 pH so I might

1171
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,959
have read that a little bit wrong but

1172
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,039
basically he's seeing these pH

1173
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,159
adjustments with adding carbonated water

1174
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,960
in there so can you give us some insight

1175
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,960
on carbonated water whether or not it's

1176
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,838
beneficial to use within the grow yeah

1177
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,199
carbonated water is not beneficial to

1178
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,358
use in a grow there's a couple of

1179
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,239
reasons for this the primary reason is

1180
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,239
that carbonated water contains CO2 and

1181
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,959
CO2 inside of the water likes to not

1182
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,399
stay in the water so it goes up and out

1183
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,119
of the water um so these swings in PH

1184
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,480
actually follow this equilibrium between

1185
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,240
carbonic acid that's dissolved inside of

1186
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,280
the solution or the liquid phase and

1187
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,479
then the CO2 that's being spontaneously

1188
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,160
off gased this is actually why this is

1189
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,000
the same exact phenomena why if you open

1190
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,838
up a can of soda on a hot summer day

1191
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,719
well first off all all carbonated

1192
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:34,000
beverages are pressurized the reason

1193
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,838
that they're pressurized is because if

1194
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,239
they're not pressurized the CO2 wants to

1195
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,719
leave in a normal atmospheric setting

1196
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,118
just like Outdoors uh or even just

1197
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,759
sitting inside of a living room because

1198
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,318
we're not in a pressurized environment

1199
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,920
anytime that we have CO2 present inside

1200
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,880
of a liquid solution the natural default

1201
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,480
tendency is or the default state is for

1202
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,160
that CO2 to escape back out into the

1203
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,838
atmosphere so um this this is why the pH

1204
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,679
swings because initially you have a high

1205
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,039
concentration of carbonic acid that's

1206
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,519
present um which lowers the ph and then

1207
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,880
if you just let that you know can of

1208
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,239
soda or carbonated water sit out for

1209
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,119
long enough it will eventually go

1210
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,838
completely flat it'll still have you

1211
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,318
know it'll be mildly acidic but um the

1212
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,599
point is that the CO2 doesn't want to

1213
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:19,318
stay in there so it doesn't really serve

1214
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,318
a benefit to the plants um also it's

1215
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,119
worth mentioning that the the oxygen

1216
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:27,039
that's present that's attached to the

1217
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,358
carbon is what um creates an energy draw

1218
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,880
on the plants you know they have to use

1219
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:32,159
the power of the sun to break that

1220
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,680
oxygen off of the carbon so it's not

1221
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,000
like you're doing the plants any favors

1222
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,719
by watering in CO2 it'd be better to

1223
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,639
have instead of the oxidized carbon or

1224
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,159
the one that has the oxygen it'd be

1225
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,598
better to have reduced carbon meaning no

1226
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,239
oxygen inside of it things like organic

1227
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,200
acids are a really good example of this

1228
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,559
because they already have that power

1229
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:52,639
that energy is already kind of built

1230
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:54,960
into the bond um that the molecule has

1231
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,440
with you know the carbon based molecule

1232
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,760
has a particular amount of power power

1233
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,800
that's stored inside of it or energy

1234
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,359
that's stored inside of it um the other

1235
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,119
thing to consider too is that often

1236
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,559
times carbonated water can interact

1237
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,039
adversely with minerals like calcium for

1238
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,358
example you can start to form

1239
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,838
bicarbonates bicarbonate residues in the

1240
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,559
soil and the buildup of bicarbonate can

1241
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,078
actually be quite harmful this is why

1242
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,639
when you look at applying things like

1243
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,359
oyster shell meal or crab shell meal or

1244
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,558
any kind of shell meal that's a calcium

1245
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,119
rich even even eggshells from chickens

1246
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,839
they have the same problem of the

1247
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,920
carbonate there is not very conducive to

1248
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,039
plant biochemistry nor is it conducive

1249
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,039
towards soil chemistry and a lot of

1250
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:34,119
times it just kind of like it binds up

1251
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,838
and ties minerals in a way that makes

1252
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,400
them less available for plants to take

1253
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,920
up um bicarbonate residues can also

1254
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,440
Drive the ph up as well this is why

1255
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,280
often times I see well water that has a

1256
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,760
high pH well water can be alkaline the

1257
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,880
pH sometimes can be eight or nine

1258
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
because there's calcium in the Pres you

1259
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,079
know calcium is present inside of that

1260
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,200
well water but it's specifically in the

1261
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:56,960
form of calcium carbonate or calcium

1262
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,239
bicarbonate you know there are these

1263
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,358
various carbonate um you know molecules

1264
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,719
attached to the calcium or the Magnesium

1265
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,239
or the potassium that make it a little

1266
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,519
bit less soluble overall so it could be

1267
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,759
a little bit of a problem more than it

1268
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,599
is a good way to deliver carbon to the

1269
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,400
plants that kind of make sense yeah I

1270
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,079
actually have a lot of bicarbonates and

1271
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,599
actually a lot of sodium in my tap water

1272
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,519
and that increases my pH and uh I didn't

1273
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,680
really know the impact of it at first I

1274
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,000
mean I tried to use my tap water before

1275
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,879
you know I wanted to be more

1276
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,079
eco-friendly here in the tap water

1277
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,358
instead of uh having to use AO which

1278
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,079
does produce some some waste water which

1279
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,480
I actually use that in my outdoor Garden

1280
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,280
so I'm not truly truly wasting it but

1281
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,159
having the sodium and bicarbonates in it

1282
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
screwed up my plants so I'm never using

1283
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,358
those ever again I'm forced to kind of

1284
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,000
filter it out and I feel like bicarbon

1285
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:49,639
it's kind of sneak in people's regimen

1286
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,159
in in a sense in their source of water

1287
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:53,639
right so yeah I'm glad you mentioned

1288
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:56,078
that and called that one out yeah yeah

1289
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,118
and that kind of that Dov tails

1290
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,280
perfectly into a question about you know

1291
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,318
like adjusting the pH I guess you could

1292
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,160
say you know is that what what would you

1293
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:05,558
use to adjust the pH obviously you know

1294
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,480
it's an important

1295
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,280
consideration um I do think that in some

1296
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,440
cases like for your water in particular

1297
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,920
if you have a lot of calcium carbonate

1298
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,599
or even sodium

1299
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,480
carbonate um particularly if it's high

1300
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,838
in calcium you know the the least

1301
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,719
effective way to adjust the pH is going

1302
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,440
to be by using a phosphoric acid based

1303
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:28,439
or a sulfuric acid based pH Down and the

1304
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,880
reason for that is because if you have

1305
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,599
high calcium dissolved in the tap water

1306
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,800
or in the well water and you're putting

1307
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,400
a large amount of phosphorus or sulfur

1308
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,000
in with that you're going to create

1309
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,559
calcium sulfate which is gypsum or

1310
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,838
drywall or you're going to create

1311
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,760
calcium phosphate which is what your

1312
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,480
bones are made out of and neither one of

1313
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,559
those two forms of calcium is very

1314
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,039
soluble so what you're doing is taking

1315
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,640
the calcium that's naturally present in

1316
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,920
the water and exposing it to a compound

1317
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,000
that decreases the availability of that

1318
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,280
calcium I would say it's a much better

1319
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,199
better idea to use something like

1320
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,200
vinegar to adjust the pH because that

1321
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:05,519
particular um form of calcium calcium

1322
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,239
acetate is significantly more soluble

1323
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,480
it's like thousands of times more

1324
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,439
soluble than the calcium phosphate and

1325
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,519
the calcium sulfate so for every drop of

1326
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,519
vinegar that you put in you could be

1327
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,679
increasing the availability of calcium

1328
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,559
significantly for the plants rather than

1329
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,358
decreasing it the other thing to

1330
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,280
consider too is that a lot of the

1331
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,440
interactions that organic acids have

1332
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,720
with carbonates is one that they'll

1333
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,480
attack chemically the carbonate Bond

1334
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,879
itself that that you know the carbonate

1335
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,039
is bonded to a cation and they'll attack

1336
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,400
that Bond free up that mineral and

1337
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,639
effectively keate it or complex it and

1338
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,119
then the bicarbonate gets off gas to CO2

1339
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:45,239
because of that chemical attack if you

1340
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,358
will that uh proper pH down like a

1341
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,719
vinegar based PH down would be able to

1342
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,119
afford um most of the vinegar out there

1343
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,838
that you buy at the store is going to be

1344
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,400
around 3 to 5% acidity if you're dealing

1345
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,639
with really really hard well water it

1346
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,519
might be beneficial to find something

1347
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,239
stronger they do make like an 80% acetic

1348
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,480
acid solution sometimes it'll be called

1349
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,479
glacial acetic acid um the stuff is very

1350
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,920
very concentrated you know phosphoric

1351
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,079
acid is interesting because you can open

1352
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,519
up a bottle of 75% fos acid and smell it

1353
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,519
and it smells actually kind of sweet

1354
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,318
it's not unpalatable but if you try to

1355
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,039
do the same thing with 80% vinegar

1356
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,159
you're going to burn your nose your eyes

1357
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:22,639
are going to burn you're going to cough

1358
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:24,759
and it's just not going to be a good day

1359
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,679
so I would recommend people to use

1360
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,240
vinegar if they're dealing with water

1361
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:30,558
that's high in calcium but find the

1362
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,959
appropriate strength if it's 3 to 5%

1363
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,000
that's perfectly fine it's going to work

1364
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,760
great nice little benefit there too is

1365
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,880
that any kind of excess organic acid

1366
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,760
excess vinegar is going to get rapidly

1367
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,400
metabolized it's a really really good

1368
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,400
food source for beneficial microbes and

1369
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,480
fungi in fact acetic acid residues or

1370
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,920
acetates are the most common metabolites

1371
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,639
in all of nature everything has an

1372
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,480
acetate associated with it at some point

1373
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:58,358
everything that microbes do um dovetails

1374
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,760
perfectly into acetate based chemistry

1375
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:03,318
and same thing with fungi and plants as

1376
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,280
well they all utilize very very high

1377
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,440
concentrations of acetate so it becomes

1378
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,040
very difficult to throw the equilibrium

1379
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,760
in the soil off it becomes very

1380
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,358
difficult to burn the plants you could

1381
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,880
easily overdo it with something like a

1382
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:16,480
sulfuric acid or a nitric acid

1383
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,599
phosphoric acid you know you can really

1384
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,400
damage um if taken too far you can

1385
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,599
really damage the physical and chemical

1386
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,838
properties of the soil plus the

1387
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,039
biological qualities of the soil but the

1388
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,599
same thing is much hard hard to achieve

1389
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,920
when you're using organic acids like

1390
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,640
vinegar it's so difficult to put too

1391
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,119
much in obviously you you'd have to like

1392
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,400
really go overboard but you know um

1393
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,599
point being ultimately that there's a

1394
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,240
huge buffer range as far as what's safe

1395
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,318
and what's acceptable I'm going to have

1396
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,838
to switch to vinegar after hear in this

1397
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,838
one yeah cuz that was one of the

1398
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,880
questions is a lot of Growers swear that

1399
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,440
using some sort of organic or allnatural

1400
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,838
PH adjuster is better than using like

1401
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,760
phosphoric acid for example lemon juice

1402
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,719
was named you talked about vinegar

1403
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,839
baking soda was also named so you would

1404
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,000
generally recommend for them for folks

1405
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:05,279
to go after those sources versus

1406
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,960
synthetic sources I would say in mosta

1407
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,240
in almost all cases yeah it makes a lot

1408
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,159
of sense to do it that way um and keep

1409
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:13,719
in mind too that you know the organic

1410
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,358
acids like the if you're using lemon

1411
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,199
juice for example or if you're using uh

1412
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,519
vinegar those types of acids are quickly

1413
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,358
metabolized by almost all organisms on

1414
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,519
this planet um this is a really

1415
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:28,279
important consideration because

1416
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,119
when plants are exposed to high

1417
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,400
concentrations of these acids they can

1418
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,880
take them up and they'll just burn them

1419
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,960
as extra fuel sources it's not a problem

1420
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,280
for them to intake you know pretty much

1421
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,159
everything that you throw at them and to

1422
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,880
be able to actually properly metabolize

1423
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,279
it plants have not evolved similar

1424
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,119
mechanisms to deal with high

1425
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,040
concentrations of phosphoric acid

1426
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,680
because it just doesn't exist out of

1427
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,400
nature like there's no such thing as

1428
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,679
phosphoric acid out of nature anywhere

1429
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,400
but there is such a thing as vinegar and

1430
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,598
acetic acid and citric acid and ascorbic

1431
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,599
acid acid which is what you're going to

1432
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,599
find inside of lemon juice which is

1433
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,119
Vitamin C basically citric acid is a

1434
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,440
little bit different I think a lot of

1435
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:06,880
people associate citrus fruits with

1436
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,920
citric acid and certainly citrus fruits

1437
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,358
produce some citric acid but they

1438
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,079
primarily produce a different kind of

1439
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:14,838
acid called ascorbic acid which is

1440
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,200
vitamin C and that's the chief organic

1441
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:18,960
acid that they produce but um ascorbic

1442
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,480
acid is useful in Plants it's actually a

1443
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,760
fundamental in all plants that are grown

1444
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,119
anywhere on Earth ascorbic acid is one

1445
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,880
of the fundamental non entic

1446
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:30,240
antioxidants inside of a plant meaning

1447
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,880
if you knock out ascorbic acid and you

1448
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,798
just prevent the plant from having it

1449
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,200
there is no such thing as a plant cell

1450
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,480
anymore it can't function without

1451
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,519
ascorbic acid it's fundamental to the

1452
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,559
existence of a plant so of course it

1453
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,798
makes sense if you supplement organic

1454
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,880
acids like vitamin C to the plants that

1455
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:47,599
they naturally have a very uh

1456
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,119
sophisticated way of dealing with it

1457
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,200
they they can fun you they break they

1458
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,920
can take it in break it down and then

1459
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:56,118
funnel that energy towards any number of

1460
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,318
things but that's not true with sulfuric

1461
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,838
acid or nitric acid or phosphoric acid

1462
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,679
so you'll find that the tolerance that

1463
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,838
your plants and your soil and your

1464
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:08,919
microbes have for vinegar are

1465
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,199
significantly greater than you know for

1466
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,318
phosphoric acid and some of the

1467
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,039
synthetic pH Downs um I would avoid

1468
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:18,880
using baking soda if possible because

1469
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,838
baking soda is typically um it's a it's

1470
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,480
a carbonator or bicarbonate um and that

1471
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,078
could kind of create some some issues

1472
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:30,000
overall so now can some of these pH Up

1473
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:31,440
PH down sources kill off microbes that's

1474
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,039
a common thing that people had mentioned

1475
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,358
like hey if you're using these things

1476
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:39,318
they're killing off microbes now

1477
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:41,480
obviously in their raw form right isn't

1478
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:42,920
vinica used as like a cleaning method

1479
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,159
it's like it's supposed to kill off

1480
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,440
microbes so like in its raw form it'll

1481
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:49,920
do harm but people worried that when

1482
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,838
you're using ph up and PH down just in

1483
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,159
water it's still harming microbial life

1484
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:55,759
once you're actually pouring that into

1485
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,399
the medium is there any truth to to that

1486
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,960
or is that just Bro Science for the

1487
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,838
purpose of the dilute feed water that

1488
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,920
you're applying to the plants it's not

1489
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,480
really going to harm the microbes in

1490
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,798
fact like nitrates for example which I

1491
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,400
think a lot of people associate with

1492
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,920
detrimental effects on soil biology

1493
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,920
nitrates are very common they're a

1494
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,720
natural source of nitrogen um they get

1495
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,720
produced by microbes they get produced

1496
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:22,078
by you know thunderstorms when there's

1497
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,558
lightning that goes through the sky that

1498
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,280
intense heat that plasma that's

1499
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:28,319
generated breaks dite nren gas bonds

1500
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,040
apart in the atmosphere and if there's

1501
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,039
rain it'll take that you know nitrogen

1502
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,400
that's been broken apart and solubilize

1503
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,079
it and rain down some nitrates that's

1504
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,880
why plants actually look you know after

1505
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,760
a thunderstorm the air has a particular

1506
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,280
smell and plants may look a little bit

1507
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,240
more perky and a little bit more green

1508
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,040
and it has partially to do with the fact

1509
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,479
that there's soluble nitrogen fertilizer

1510
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,000
being created as a part of this natural

1511
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,760
process so nitrates are very very

1512
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,199
natural um when used excessively I think

1513
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,240
they can throw equilibriums off in soils

1514
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:00,439
and it takes a long time to actually you

1515
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,399
know destroy the soil biology because

1516
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,200
the soil bi biology will do everything

1517
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,838
that it can to stay alive um if you're

1518
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,078
talking about like the specific

1519
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:11,039
mechanism of action for oxidizers which

1520
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,400
are like you know potassium hydroxide

1521
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,279
based ph up I mean yeah they'll break

1522
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,440
down cell walls they will completely

1523
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,400
denature DNA and they'll cause

1524
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,639
irreversible damage to anything that it

1525
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,318
touches plants fungi um microorganisms

1526
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:27,440
even humans shouldn't be exposed to

1527
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,159
pottassium hydroxide but again for the

1528
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,519
purpose of creating D dilute feed water

1529
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,480
um usually it's not measured in that

1530
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,519
kind of way um you know pottassium

1531
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,760
hydroxide is used to make soap and last

1532
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,559
time you washed your hands with soap it

1533
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,040
didn't cause a chemical burn right so

1534
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,280
the way that something is ultimately

1535
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:45,960
processed informs how it's going to be

1536
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,359
metabolized or how it's going to be

1537
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,240
accepted into a system um I would say if

1538
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:53,000
you're just dosing your plants with just

1539
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,519
straight ph up or pH Down um that's

1540
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,280
going to cause some serious damage but

1541
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:57,480
again when you're talking about the tank

1542
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,519
of feed water that's made that you're

1543
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,400
going to apply to your plants usually

1544
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,639
that tends to hang out in a PH range

1545
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,599
that's mostly acceptable and the

1546
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:08,879
concentration of nutrients is also um

1547
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,960
pretty universally accepted for all

1548
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,960
plants and all microbes and all fungi

1549
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,519
you may notice a decrease in the overall

1550
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,838
activity of certain like fungi for

1551
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,400
example that are known to help plants

1552
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:22,279
access phosphorus in phosphorus limited

1553
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,280
conditions this is one of the benefits

1554
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,839
that um you know beneficial might uh

1555
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,400
beneficial fungi can bring into the

1556
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,880
garden but if you're not deficient in

1557
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,559
phosphorus that one little pathway could

1558
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,039
get turned off but there's other

1559
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,480
benefits associated with having that

1560
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,159
fungi there you know there could be some

1561
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,599
stress response or stress related um

1562
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,399
benefits there could be some disease

1563
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,480
suppression benefits fungi produce all

1564
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,559
kinds of wonderful antimicrobial

1565
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,159
compounds antiviral compounds these can

1566
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,519
be useful for plants um outside of just

1567
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:54,960
their ability to help fix and make a

1568
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,480
little bit of phosphorus more available

1569
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,960
to to the plants got it and you kind of

1570
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,480
touched upon the next question here a

1571
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,838
little bit but I'm going to ask it again

1572
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,000
in case there's anything else that you

1573
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:08,159
can add to it which is synthetic

1574
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,358
nutrients killing off microbes now it's

1575
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,879
often said that mineral-based or

1576
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:14,598
synthetic nutrients salt-based is going

1577
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,480
to cause a high seleny environment

1578
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:18,160
that's going to kill off the microbial

1579
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,639
life in the soil now some people say

1580
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,879
that that's true you know a lot of

1581
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:23,519
organic gardeners they avoid bottled

1582
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,200
nutrients because of that and other

1583
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:29,559
folks say that that's false that these

1584
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:31,358
microbes are able to withstand the henan

1585
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:33,160
environment down in the root Zone what's

1586
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,119
your take on that I mean I think soil

1587
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:39,318
microorganisms are capable of living in

1588
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:41,119
environments that um are pretty intense

1589
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:43,079
I think there's some evidence to suggest

1590
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,039
they can even survive on comets that

1591
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,318
have been you know maybe not comets but

1592
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:48,519
like some spacecraft that have been

1593
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:50,960
launched toter space I remember there

1594
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:52,440
was a study that was done on water bears

1595
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,039
tardigrada was the genus and they had

1596
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,240
launched them into outer space basically

1597
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,159
Bally noticed that you know the intense

1598
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,078
radiation outside of the atmosphere of

1599
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:03,039
the earth um these water bears were

1600
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,760
capable of surviving and and actually

1601
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:07,199
reproducing so um in some cases I think

1602
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,799
the same thing is true of fungi and

1603
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,159
microbes I think there's even a theory

1604
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,159
out there that suggests that either

1605
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,199
beneficial microbes or fungi you know

1606
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:17,239
once came from a different planet and

1607
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,759
they somehow survived on a comet that

1608
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:21,318
smashed into the planet and that's how

1609
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,440
life started or spread so if you just

1610
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,038
look at the uh ability of these

1611
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,159
microorganisms to survive in extremely

1612
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:31,359
harsh environments it becomes clear that

1613
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,118
you know a little bit of ion ionized

1614
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:35,880
fertilizer isn't really going to damage

1615
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,160
them sufficiently enough to kill them um

1616
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,480
I would say in most cases the microbes

1617
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,879
themselves have the ability to resist

1618
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,199
those types of stressors if you will and

1619
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,480
then also keep in mind that anything

1620
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:48,399
that really directly benefits the plant

1621
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,960
the microbes will find a way to dovetail

1622
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,240
into that operation because their

1623
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,240
primary interest is in getting sugars

1624
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,798
from the plant right so they form these

1625
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,199
beneficial Rel relationships the plant

1626
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:59,559
will photosynthesize and produce sugars

1627
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,318
and even if you're using a synthetic

1628
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,000
fertilizer as long as the plant is

1629
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:04,599
healthy and it's growing it's very

1630
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,719
likely that the plant is capable of also

1631
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:08,079
supporting beneficial relationships in

1632
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,439
the soil too so that's a major

1633
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,798
consideration um I will say that there

1634
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,440
are um physical and chemical changes

1635
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,079
that can happen to the soil depending on

1636
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,119
how much organic matter is going to be

1637
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:21,000
present inside of a feed program I guess

1638
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,480
you could say if you're just feating

1639
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,480
pure salt-based fertilizer with no

1640
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,838
organic matter whatsoever no humic acid

1641
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,119
no se plant extracts no terrestrial

1642
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:34,400
plant extracts just salt-based

1643
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,880
fertilizer over time the introduction of

1644
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,680
high concentrations of these elements

1645
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,200
can start to strip away at the organic

1646
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:43,838
matter and it's really the loss of the

1647
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,919
organic matter in soils that's tied to a

1648
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:48,239
decline in the populations of beneficial

1649
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,480
microbs and beneficial fungi so if you

1650
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,199
can focus on building up that healthy

1651
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,280
soil chemistry effectively what that

1652
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,159
means is that you're building up the

1653
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,039
supply of carbon available for those

1654
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,960
microorganisms to thrive on and if that

1655
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,559
if anything attacks that directly like

1656
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,960
you know nitrates and other um

1657
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,359
salt-based compounds that come in

1658
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,199
through you know salt-based fertilizer

1659
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,000
programs those can actually start to

1660
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,598
directly impact the concentration of

1661
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,480
organic matter and as that decreases so

1662
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,119
too does the populations of beneficial

1663
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,719
microbes and fungi but as far as the

1664
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,200
direct link between you know the

1665
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,519
salt-based fertilizers and the viability

1666
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,439
of beneficial microbes and fungi I think

1667
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,159
it's a little bit more disconnected like

1668
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,880
there's there's other layers of stuff

1669
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:32,679
that you have to work through in order

1670
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,880
to get to that Downstream effect of yeah

1671
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:36,399
this damaged the soil biology well how

1672
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,119
did it damage the soil biology it

1673
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,960
stripped all the carbon um it removed

1674
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,960
everything that the microbes depend on

1675
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,400
for Life basically and you know that's

1676
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,760
ultimately what ends up happening got it

1677
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,720
yeah I appreciate you expanding on that

1678
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:54,280
one I still I mean I've been working in

1679
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:55,480
the industry here since 2015 and this is

1680
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,280
something that has has been brought up

1681
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,119
since then and still to this day people

1682
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,640
still bring it up and still want to talk

1683
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,680
about it so appreciate getting your

1684
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:05,400
Insight on there and giving us some uh

1685
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,838
some additional information so these

1686
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,639
next couple ones on the list were

1687
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,759
actually submitted by you something you

1688
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,920
want to talk about first up let's talk

1689
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,559
PK boosters give us your Insight on

1690
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,920
those I think there is a little bit of a

1691
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,400
myth associated with PK boosters I think

1692
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,798
people overutilize phosphorus without

1693
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,720
understanding exactly how it's going to

1694
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:26,038
get metabolized in the plants and the

1695
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:28,399
important thing to remember is that most

1696
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,160
phosphorus in the maybe not most but

1697
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,440
let's say half of the phosphorus roughly

1698
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:34,639
that you apply to your plants is going

1699
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,880
to get recycled in the plant it's not

1700
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,879
going to just get sunk into some like

1701
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,798
calcium for example get sunk into a cell

1702
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,680
wall it kind of hangs out there and it

1703
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,280
doesn't really interact with the rest of

1704
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:46,480
the plant once it's been deposited so

1705
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,079
plants naturally have a very high

1706
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,838
appetite for calcium they can take up

1707
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,280
monster quantities of it because they

1708
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:53,639
know there is a terminal sink they can

1709
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,839
just shove it in a cell wall and they

1710
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,118
don't have to deal with it so if they

1711
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,038
get a little bit more than what they

1712
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,640
actually need it's perfectly fine cuz

1713
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:03,039
they they can always find a place to you

1714
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,480
know put it into and and make a new cell

1715
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,760
wall out of um but for phosphorus

1716
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,960
because it's primarily recycled in

1717
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,280
plants or it becomes a constituent of

1718
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,039
membranes um which are also more or less

1719
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,920
like fixed you know they they don't um

1720
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,599
regenerate or they don't require as much

1721
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,000
replenishment like calcium and saw walls

1722
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:26,240
does um this being the case means that

1723
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,639
the optimum concentration of phosphorus

1724
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,000
to expose your plants to is actually a

1725
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,000
lot lower than a lot of Growers think

1726
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,440
and I think according to the research

1727
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,280
articles that have been put out there

1728
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,358
most plants will do well with about 30

1729
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,440
to 50 ppms of Elemental phosphorus what

1730
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:42,358
you see on the labels is actually not

1731
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,599
Elemental phosphorus it's phosphorus

1732
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:45,558
expressed as

1733
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,039
p205 so there's a little bit of a

1734
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:50,480
conversion factor how do you go from P

1735
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:53,359
to p25 there's a number you multiply by

1736
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,838
I think it's like 4364 or something like

1737
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,038
that but you know quick Google Google

1738
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:57,759
search for those of you who are

1739
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,720
interested just type in conversion

1740
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,200
factor

1741
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:04,598
P to uh p205 you know do that and then

1742
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,719
you'll find a calculator online that

1743
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:08,240
will allow you to convert it but

1744
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:09,759
basically 30 to 50 ppms is kind of The

1745
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:12,719
Sweet Spot for most plants and to give

1746
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,240
you guys some context in the vegetative

1747
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,318
stage of growth where your plants are

1748
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,879
taking in a large concentration of

1749
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:22,159
nitrogen you can feed upwards of 150

1750
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,200
maybe closer to 200 parts per million of

1751
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:28,239
nitrogen compare that with 30 to 50 of

1752
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:31,078
phosphorus um pottassium you can feed in

1753
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,959
some cases I've seen you know in excess

1754
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,519
of 400 parts per million probably closer

1755
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,960
to 500 parts per million compare that

1756
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,599
with 30 to 50 of phosphorus and then

1757
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,720
same thing with calcium calcium can be

1758
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,318
fed in massive concentrations 200 plus

1759
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,879
ppms no problem and again phosphorus

1760
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:50,440
clocks in 30 to 50 so in a lot of cases

1761
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,000
I think when adding too much of a PK

1762
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,200
booster into the soil really what you're

1763
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,199
doing is encouraging the tie up between

1764
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:58,159
the phosphorus that's needed in low

1765
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,078
concentrations and the calcium that's

1766
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,078
needed in high concentrations and this

1767
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,519
is why during the mid to late stages of

1768
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,519
Bloom plants tend to slow down they get

1769
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:10,400
yellow the disease pressure start to

1770
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:13,480
creep in things like um molds and milus

1771
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,358
petrius these things start to become uh

1772
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,559
disease pressures for plants not because

1773
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,960
of anything to do with phosphorus

1774
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:22,160
directly but rather a lack of calcium

1775
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,119
that's caused by excess of phosphorus

1776
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,639
fertilization it's also worth mentioning

1777
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:28,960
that because phosphorus doesn't have an

1778
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:30,358
actual sink for most plants I mean it it

1779
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,838
does if you're growing for seed right if

1780
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:34,239
you grow some flowers out and you want

1781
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,838
those flowers to actually be pollinated

1782
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,919
and to develop a seed the actual seed

1783
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,239
itself is a good sink for phosphorus so

1784
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,680
you can if you're growing for seed and

1785
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,479
you want good viability from those seeds

1786
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,719
it makes sense in that context to do a

1787
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,838
little bit of a PK boost particularly

1788
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,399
during the seed formation stage because

1789
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:52,119
then the plants will take up the extra

1790
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,838
phosphorus and they'll actually sink it

1791
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:55,318
into the seed but if you're growing just

1792
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,278
the flower

1793
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,079
and you don't want any seeds the overall

1794
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:01,719
maximum for phosphorus is going to be

1795
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,000
much lower because again there's no seed

1796
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:06,078
and so there's no sink for the plant

1797
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,599
this is an important consideration okay

1798
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,960
let's move down the line here I don't

1799
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,240
want to take up too much of your time we

1800
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,720
definitely pass the hour mark by now but

1801
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,239
lot of good information I'm going to hit

1802
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:19,199
you with a few more here and then I'll

1803
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:21,159
let you go foler sprays or foiler spray

1804
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,399
I think some people pronounce it foiler

1805
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:25,199
some people pronounce it foler either

1806
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,119
way tomatoes tomato

1807
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:30,278
spraying with the lights on versus

1808
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,880
lights off now some people say this's

1809
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,400
harm in spraying with the lights on

1810
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,160
other people say it's going to be fine

1811
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,960
what's your take on that um it depends

1812
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,440
on what it is you're applying to the

1813
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,960
plants and it depends on the nature of

1814
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,480
the keyate itself I will say um it's

1815
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,960
worth paying attention to what happens

1816
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,679
in a tropical rainforest where the sun

1817
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,559
is always out and it tends to rain quite

1818
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:52,798
a bit and it seems like tropical

1819
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,039
rainforests are pretty uh diverse in

1820
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,038
terms of the total number of plant

1821
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:57,799
species so these are very very

1822
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,920
biodiverse regions there's a huge number

1823
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:00,759
of plants that are growing and they've

1824
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,680
kind of evolved these mechanisms to deal

1825
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:06,039
with you know the the Sun and Rain being

1826
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,960
present at the same time um there's no

1827
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:10,079
real like magnifying effect I've heard

1828
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,358
people um say something like that where

1829
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,039
water droplets can kind of magnify the

1830
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,558
energy of the sun um I don't really

1831
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:19,000
think that's the case to be perfectly

1832
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,880
honest I do think that there's some

1833
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,358
cause for concern if you're dealing with

1834
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,640
you know compounds that are insoluble

1835
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:27,798
that are present inside of the water

1836
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:29,838
that you're applying like carbonates for

1837
01:03:27,798 --> 01:03:31,798
example if you've got well water that's

1838
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,519
a very high TDS and it's not treated and

1839
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:36,358
it's not filtered doing fure sprays of

1840
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,519
that could result in some kind of damage

1841
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:41,358
because what ends up happening is as the

1842
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:43,239
outer layer of the leaf dries the

1843
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,199
minerals that are present inside of that

1844
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:47,118
water end up not being absorbed properly

1845
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,759
by the plant and they tend to hang out

1846
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,880
on the outer layers of the leaf so as

1847
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,240
the water evaporates and the leaf

1848
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,798
surface dries off they're prog

1849
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,639
aggressively begins to be a little bit

1850
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,358
of salt formation that happens and it's

1851
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:02,480
really that salt formation that can you

1852
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:04,759
know create some problems for the plants

1853
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,159
if you have organic acids if you've got

1854
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,400
amino acids or if you've got some

1855
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:11,078
chelated forms of nutrients those

1856
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,160
typically get absorbed pretty rapidly

1857
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:15,278
through the leaf surfaces and doing

1858
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:17,679
foler sprays with the lights on is

1859
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:20,079
generally speaking not an issue um

1860
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,679
obviously it makes sense you know to

1861
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,240
test on a small number of plants first

1862
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:26,318
and maybe turn the lights down a little

1863
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,558
little bit maybe at 50% if you've got

1864
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,480
the ability to adjust the light

1865
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,039
intensity but if you've never done

1866
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,079
something like that before or if you're

1867
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:36,480
curious to see if the nutrients that you

1868
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,599
have are available through the leaf

1869
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,000
surfaces that's a good practice pick a

1870
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:41,318
small number of plants turn the lights

1871
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,119
down a little bit spray the plants

1872
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:44,798
during the middle of the day and see

1873
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,240
what happens and then from there work

1874
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,960
your way up to gradually becoming more

1875
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,318
and more comfortable feeding your plants

1876
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,039
um with the lights on doing F your

1877
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,639
sprays I think it can in a lot of ways

1878
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:55,920
it can actually be highly beneficial

1879
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:58,000
because water itself has a very high

1880
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,358
heat capacity it can absorb a lot of

1881
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,239
heat um and this is important on days

1882
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,798
where it's very very hot in fact I

1883
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,679
remember a couple of years ago here in

1884
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:09,400
Washington it was very hot you know

1885
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:11,480
maybe 2 or 3 years ago in August it was

1886
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,960
something like 110° and we typically

1887
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,240
don't get that hot here in the Pacific

1888
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,519
Northwest I mean for us a really hot day

1889
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,719
is like 85 to 90° so for us to be

1890
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,079
sitting at 110 was like freakishly hot

1891
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,719
and I remember going outside I was

1892
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,880
growing some zucchini and cucumbers at

1893
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:28,399
the time I remember going outside and I

1894
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:31,400
ful sprayed my plants with a calcium

1895
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,480
chelate it was 110° outside it was 100

1896
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,278
p.m. smack dab in the middle of the day

1897
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,039
you know in the middle of August and the

1898
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:40,480
sun was directly overhead I mean they

1899
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,960
could not have gotten any more intense

1900
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,358
um but because the keyate that I was

1901
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,000
spraying was 100% available for the

1902
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:47,838
plants to take up it didn't burn them at

1903
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,760
all and I used a pretty hefty dose I

1904
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,519
used a dose that was somewhere between

1905
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,160
80 to 100 ml per gallon which is

1906
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:55,480
astronomical I mean I would typically

1907
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,798
for this calcium chelate I would

1908
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,559
recommend people use it um at the rate

1909
01:05:57,798 --> 01:06:02,599
of maybe 10 to 20 Mill per gallon and I

1910
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,480
ended up using it 80 to 100 milliliters

1911
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:05,880
per gallon which is crazy high

1912
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,079
concentration so if there was any kind

1913
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,358
of phytotoxicity associated with that

1914
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,680
compound itself it would have manifested

1915
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:13,480
itself within a matter of minutes

1916
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,879
because the leaf surface dried out

1917
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,760
within 10 minutes but the plants

1918
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,920
actually looked a little bit more perky

1919
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,000
they looked a little bit more Upp and I

1920
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,639
I attribute part of that effect that I

1921
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,798
saw to the fact that I sprayed water on

1922
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:26,199
the leaf surface so all of that heat the

1923
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:27,400
leaf surface temperature it was just

1924
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:29,598
baking in the sun it was getting

1925
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,720
scorched and it wasn't doing too well of

1926
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,838
course I come and give it a cool spray

1927
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:36,000
of water that water soaks up that heat

1928
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,558
just like a sponge and the leaf surface

1929
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,400
cooled down dramatically now instead of

1930
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,160
the engine overheating within plants now

1931
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,278
we've brought that engine back to its

1932
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,639
operational temperature range now it's

1933
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:47,440
just kind of cruising along through the

1934
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:49,000
rest of the day so I would say there's

1935
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,679
some real benefits associated with the

1936
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,599
timing of application being the middle

1937
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:54,639
of the day if you have those types of

1938
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:56,079
stressors where it's very hot and the

1939
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,239
light intensity is very high and you

1940
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,960
know you have a good fully key product

1941
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,759
that's not going to cause phytotoxicity

1942
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:05,599
issues that's good to know this reminds

1943
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,000
me of conversation we had with por

1944
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,559
cantes actually didn't get a chance to

1945
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,679
um to talk to him about it I had him on

1946
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:13,519
the from the stash podcast that episode

1947
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,159
is being released in a couple weeks here

1948
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:16,559
but one of the things that I wanted to

1949
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:19,558
talk to him but couldn't talk to him

1950
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,960
about was reverse foler feeding so I

1951
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,720
actually have a little excerpt from his

1952
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,559
grower Bible book and I'd like to get

1953
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:27,278
your thoughts on it since it relates to

1954
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,480
folar feeding and it's talking about

1955
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:31,318
clones it says the clones from the lower

1956
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,318
branches root easiest because they

1957
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:35,798
contain more of the proper hormones

1958
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:37,358
clones quickly develop a dense system of

1959
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:39,599
roots when stems have a high

1960
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,759
carbohydrate and low nitrogen

1961
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,000
concentration so it's recommended to

1962
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,200
reverse folar feed which will leech

1963
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,559
nutrients from leaves especially

1964
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:51,159
nitrogens to reverse folar feed fill a

1965
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,519
spray with clean water and Mist mother

1966
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:55,920
Heavenly every morning for 3 to 4 days

1967
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,159
older leaves may turn like green growth

1968
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,639
slows as nitrogen is used in

1969
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:02,480
carbohydrates build so my interpretation

1970
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,480
of this is if you're just spraying water

1971
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,760
on the leaves it's actually impacting it

1972
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:10,159
in a way where nitrogen is being used up

1973
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,799
a little bit more is there any truth to

1974
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:13,519
that or is this kind of outdated

1975
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:15,400
information I think it's a little bit

1976
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,079
outdated information particularly the

1977
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,960
idea that the lower branches tend to

1978
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:20,559
root out easier um it's very well

1979
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,198
established and known now that it's

1980
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,199
actually the meristematic tissue the

1981
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,960
apical meristem that con contains the

1982
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:28,198
highest concentration of oxin which are

1983
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,719
the primary rooting hormones most

1984
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:32,798
Growers are familiar with these little

1985
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:35,079
gels that they get um root gels they dip

1986
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,880
a cut inside of it and it kind of coats

1987
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:39,318
that um you know the the actual stem in

1988
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,079
the cutting so that is a synthetic

1989
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:44,359
rooting hormone called indol 3 butyric

1990
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:46,719
acid the natural analog what that

1991
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,679
synthetic version is trying to replicate

1992
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,079
is a natural rooting hormone called

1993
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:53,279
indol 3 acetic acid which is the primary

1994
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:54,960
oxin and as I mentioned just a few

1995
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,040
minutes ago acetates are the most

1996
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,960
abundant metabolite in nature here's an

1997
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,000
example of what what I'm talking about

1998
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,279
the primary growth hormone in plants is

1999
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,719
called indol 3 acetic acid it's an

2000
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,600
acetic acid residue basically so it's

2001
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:09,158
important to keep that in mind but yeah

2002
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,480
that is going to be most concentrated at

2003
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:13,119
the apical meristem um and those tend to

2004
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:14,959
have the most vigorous growth associated

2005
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:17,158
with them anyways the lower branches

2006
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,920
tend to not grow as fast as the top

2007
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:20,479
portion of the canopy the top portion of

2008
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,119
the canopy is the one that gets the

2009
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,479
majority of the transpiration stream so

2010
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:25,679
all that good nutrition that's being

2011
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:28,158
lift up from the roots it's actually

2012
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,039
being preferentially transported to that

2013
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:33,879
apical meristem the newest smallest site

2014
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:36,079
of growth so that it can constantly uh

2015
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,159
provide a stable supply of building

2016
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,920
blocks of nutrients and elements to feed

2017
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,358
the growth of the plant and so if you

2018
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,079
can capture a snapshot of that you get

2019
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,480
you get a snapshot and by snapshot I

2020
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:48,238
actually mean you know you take a cut

2021
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,838
off a plant that's very healthy growing

2022
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,358
very vigorously very rapidly those are

2023
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:54,399
the types of characteristics that you're

2024
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:57,079
likely to see come out of that

2025
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,359
um The Cutting itself and there are

2026
01:09:57,079 --> 01:09:59,640
strategies that I've seen work out

2027
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:01,880
pretty well where if you take care of

2028
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,600
your mom plants with a particular

2029
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:07,319
combination of folar sprays you can

2030
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,560
actually load those rooting hormones up

2031
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:11,000
inside of the plant so that when you

2032
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,199
take the cut it actually has precursors

2033
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,439
for indol 3 acetic acid inside of it so

2034
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,839
you don't need that um gel anymore you

2035
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,279
don't need to dip your Cuts or your

2036
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,560
clones and wait you know 7 to 10 days

2037
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,800
for them to root out you can actually

2038
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,280
put that natural compound inside of the

2039
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,719
plants it gets absorbed through the fol

2040
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:28,719
your spray in about 15 to 20 minutes

2041
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,079
later you take a cut and then everything

2042
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,880
inside of that cut is going to be

2043
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:33,920
exactly what the plant needs then

2044
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,480
propagate new roots and to grow out

2045
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,920
successfully and usually Growers will

2046
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:41,279
save a couple of days instead of 7 to 10

2047
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,440
days on uh rooting we you know might see

2048
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,599
about 5 to seven days instead no I'm

2049
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,879
going to have to try that a little

2050
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,039
shortcut there a little grow hack there

2051
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,359
yeah the amount of stuff that we have

2052
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:51,519
learned over the years I mean that quote

2053
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:53,920
that I mentioned was from a book that

2054
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,280
was written in 2006 and we have learned

2055
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,000
so much since 2006 it's awesome the

2056
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,238
amount of information that we've

2057
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,359
uncovered through science and just

2058
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:06,319
regular experiments has been exciting

2059
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:08,479
it's really exciting and I'm excited to

2060
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,679
see what happens here in the future I'm

2061
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,879
going to hit you with two more and I

2062
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,199
saved the two funnest ones for last for

2063
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,840
some they might seem completely

2064
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:19,479
outrageous others they say that it's

2065
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,119
legitimate let's hear your take on this

2066
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:24,919
music for plants does playing music for

2067
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:27,079
your plants help with plant growth I've

2068
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,440
also heard that playing bird chirping

2069
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:31,158
noises helps with plant growth whether

2070
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,719
it be a I don't know if it's the stamato

2071
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:35,599
opening or what but those are a couple

2072
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,880
things I've heard what's your take on

2073
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,719
that it's a really interesting topic and

2074
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,400
I'll say that the um the underlying

2075
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:46,279
logic was actually developed in the late

2076
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,799
1980s there was a researcher um Don

2077
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:49,800
Carlson I think was his name at

2078
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,760
University of Minnesota I want to say if

2079
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,920
my memory serves correctly but anyways

2080
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,800
you know researcher in 1986 um had put

2081
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,880
forward this idea that the stomata

2082
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,199
themselves could be the the conductance

2083
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,039
of the stomata meaning the opening and

2084
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:06,439
the closing of the stamata could be

2085
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,920
influenced by um sound frequencies and

2086
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:10,198
so what he did was he exposed those

2087
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,560
plants to 3,000 Herz to 5,000 Hertz

2088
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:14,359
which basically mimics a bird chirp in

2089
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,960
the morning and what he found was over

2090
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:19,359
15 years of research I believe it was

2091
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,319
that there is in fact a correlation

2092
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:25,238
between playing noises bird chirps Maybe

2093
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,158
music even to some extent in the overall

2094
01:12:25,238 --> 01:12:30,319
impact that it has on the the growth of

2095
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:31,759
the plants um I I'll I'll kind of back

2096
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,079
up one step and say that plants are

2097
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,880
remarkably sensitive to their

2098
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:37,800
environment they're exceptionally

2099
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,560
capable of taking in a variety of

2100
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,560
different inputs they're trying to

2101
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,520
measure and sense every possible nook

2102
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,679
and cranny of reality that's external to

2103
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,800
them because again they don't have a

2104
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,679
choice they can't like get up and move

2105
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,440
around if the environment's not ideal so

2106
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,520
they're always trying to figure out

2107
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:56,279
what's going on in the environment

2108
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,159
around them they're taking in as many

2109
01:12:56,279 --> 01:13:01,000
data points that they possibly can um

2110
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:03,759
and with that being said they are

2111
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,158
sensitive to sound waves that come

2112
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,679
through them um with specifically in

2113
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:10,719
reference to the way that the stamata um

2114
01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:12,719
open and Clos it's it's less to do with

2115
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,439
the physical opening and physical

2116
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,198
closing of the stomata and more to do

2117
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:19,279
with the maximum size of the stomata

2118
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:22,319
being opening it's maximum conductance

2119
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,399
how how open does it actually get um

2120
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,158
think about that like a fuel injector

2121
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:28,079
for a race car you know if you're trying

2122
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,960
to create more horsepower inside of the

2123
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:33,039
system you need those fuel uh injectors

2124
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,198
to squirt more fuel for every second

2125
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,279
that the engine is operational and so

2126
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,919
this kind of effectively translates to a

2127
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,759
way that the stomato open and close

2128
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,520
because if you have stomata opened a

2129
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,400
little bit further even if it's a 10 to

2130
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,920
15% increase in the conductance of the

2131
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:50,319
stomata then um you know you could

2132
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,719
theoretically achieve a 10 to 15%

2133
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,279
increase in productivity in the plants I

2134
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,239
will say that this has been studied

2135
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:57,920
extensively and it's not just like this

2136
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,439
one factor that determines it all

2137
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,920
because you know ultimately

2138
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,439
photosynthesis and even stodel

2139
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,480
conductance is driven by a very

2140
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,238
fine-tuned Balancing Act plants will

2141
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,319
open and close selectively based on a

2142
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:10,799
number of different things that occur

2143
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:13,158
during the winter time you know the

2144
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,679
sun's still out but maybe some certain

2145
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:16,439
species of plants aren't growing because

2146
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:18,279
to them it's less about the exposure to

2147
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:20,719
the Sun and more about what temperature

2148
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:22,238
it is right and then in some other cases

2149
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,198
plants are very sensitive to photop

2150
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,119
period triggers this is how initiate

2151
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:28,599
flowering and so there's all of these

2152
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:31,039
different influencing variables that

2153
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,679
ultimately kind of converge together and

2154
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,639
that's the final response that the plant

2155
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:36,760
has but if you have everything kind of

2156
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:39,960
dialed in if you have good temperature

2157
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,960
good humidity um it's very it's very

2158
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,560
true that exposing your plants to the

2159
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,319
right frequencies can actually make a a

2160
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,520
difference in their growth overall and I

2161
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,960
think that's possible to measure um I

2162
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,280
think people maybe have taken it a

2163
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,960
little bit outside the context of how

2164
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,719
that theory was initially

2165
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,158
developed and how it's been tested um

2166
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,560
but it's certainly true to say that

2167
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:02,079
plants will respond to frequencies just

2168
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,639
like they respond to frequencies of

2169
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,519
light they'll respond to frequencies of

2170
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:08,039
sound that's interesting yeah I heard a

2171
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,920
couple things that relate to this

2172
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:11,238
singing to your plant so kind of along

2173
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,199
the lines of of playing music for your

2174
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:15,599
plants but I've heard about this old

2175
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:18,839
wives till or something it was this lady

2176
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,280
who sung to her plants and then the

2177
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,239
other plants she didn't sing to and she

2178
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:24,319
saw better growth in the plants that she

2179
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,119
sung to I'll come to find out it was

2180
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:29,439
just the carbon dioxide that she was

2181
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,039
emitting you know from her her exhale

2182
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,799
that was contributing to the the growth

2183
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:33,920
it wasn't actually the the singing that

2184
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,199
did it so I thought that was kind of

2185
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,239
funny to to bring up up not sure if

2186
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,079
you've heard of of that one or not I

2187
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,158
have yeah I also wanted to bring up in

2188
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:44,559
regards of playing music for your plants

2189
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:46,279
that the DB would have to be crazy loud

2190
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,159
in order for it to be any impact the

2191
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:50,759
equivalent of a jet engine going off

2192
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:52,238
that's when uh you know has to be that

2193
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,360
loud in order for it to actually make an

2194
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:55,599
impact to the plant I don't know if

2195
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,519
that's true or not but I've heard that

2196
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,840
well you know it's interesting I mean so

2197
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,960
there's a branch of science called

2198
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,440
simatics and it's basically the effect

2199
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,000
that sound frequencies have on the

2200
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:07,839
formation of um you know like on

2201
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,238
geometric patterns that can be formed so

2202
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,039
the idea basically is like you've got a

2203
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,359
subwoofer and you put a little bit of

2204
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:13,760
salt on top of the subwoofer and

2205
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,359
depending on what frequency is being

2206
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,840
played it will generate a different kind

2207
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,479
of you know geometry I guess you could

2208
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,920
say um a lot of it is is pretty

2209
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:23,000
fascinating it's interesting to see what

2210
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,960
exactly happens but it's certainly true

2211
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,359
that but um water will respond to

2212
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,639
certain types of sound frequencies you

2213
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:31,599
know you can kind of change the geometry

2214
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:33,159
of of water so to speak and so I imagine

2215
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,159
there's a similar mechanism that could

2216
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:36,679
actually be at play here you know a lot

2217
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,359
of this stuff is very very subtle and

2218
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:41,319
very nuanced um and a lot of it is just

2219
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,799
like maybe considered a little bit taboo

2220
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:44,319
and we just don't have the

2221
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,480
instrumentation that's sensitive enough

2222
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:49,000
for us to be able to accurately measure

2223
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,359
some of this type of stuff so the um

2224
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,679
General consensus right now in the

2225
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:54,279
scientific Community is probably that

2226
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,239
it's a little bit teric more than it is

2227
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:57,599
practical but there have been a lot of

2228
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:59,638
really good research articles that have

2229
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,000
been coming out especially recently that

2230
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:02,400
kind of bridge the gaps in our

2231
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,520
understanding because they have more

2232
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:05,638
sensitive Machinery now that it's

2233
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,679
possible for us to make these

2234
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:09,760
measurements and kind of you know

2235
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,279
separate the signal from the noise in

2236
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,000
some other cases like what you just

2237
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,679
mentioned you know the singing of that

2238
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,719
this lady she sang to her plants it was

2239
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,920
actually the CO2 that she released which

2240
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:21,198
caused the increase in yield and so that

2241
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,158
that's there's some signal there and

2242
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,599
then there's some noise there too and I

2243
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:25,960
think being able to peel it apart is

2244
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,600
what we're kind of getting to a spot of

2245
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,399
being able to do um and and certainly

2246
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,840
there's good reason to think that plants

2247
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:33,679
are going to respond to this type of

2248
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,560
stuff I mean they kind of evolved they

2249
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,119
coevolved they attract pollinators like

2250
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,920
birds and like other you know uh bees

2251
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:41,960
for example and so it it stands to

2252
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,880
reason that they could also maybe

2253
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,039
there's some electromagnetic interaction

2254
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,560
there too um I think this was actually

2255
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:51,198
something that was determined to be true

2256
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,360
with uh the way that lavender um

2257
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:56,158
interacts with bees I guess lav lavender

2258
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,359
if I recall correctly um the study was

2259
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:00,479
demonstrating that lavender actually

2260
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:01,719
lavender plants emit a particular

2261
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,839
frequency it's not something that you

2262
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:05,600
can hear it's not audible frequency but

2263
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,039
it's still a frequency that gets emitted

2264
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,000
and it allows the bees to navigate

2265
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:12,600
towards the the flow that's ready to be

2266
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,520
the nectar is ready to be harvested out

2267
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,280
of that particular flour and when the

2268
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,960
bee harvests nectar out of that bud and

2269
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:22,960
it flies away the electromagnetic

2270
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,800
frequency is no longer there it's maybe

2271
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,760
turned off for about 1 minute to 2

2272
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,600
minutes while that bud you sort of you

2273
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,480
know the nectar kind of fills that butt

2274
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,679
and again I I maybe butchering the

2275
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:35,359
explanation overall of what this study

2276
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,319
demonstrated but the idea was basically

2277
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:39,359
that yeah plants are emitting if not

2278
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:40,519
noises that are audible to the human ear

2279
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,719
there's still frequencies that they're

2280
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,199
putting out there in the surrounding

2281
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:45,039
space around them to try to attract

2282
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:48,678
these pollinators some of those

2283
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:51,119
frequencies are not um compounds you

2284
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:53,158
know we often associate attracting

2285
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,439
pollinators with the production of vol

2286
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:56,879
compounds things that we can actually

2287
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:58,599
smell and this is true it does work like

2288
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,440
that but there's also something to be

2289
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,719
said about maybe other ways of

2290
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,839
attracting beneficial pollinators and I

2291
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,520
think this opens up a discussion around

2292
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,159
these electromagnetic things that we're

2293
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:11,199
starting to be able to measure and

2294
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:12,679
quantify and better understand um so

2295
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:14,799
yeah there's something there for sure

2296
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:17,239
that's incredible that's super super

2297
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,320
interesting it reminds me of a

2298
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:21,158
electroculture and that's the last one

2299
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,039
we're going to talk on talk about today

2300
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:25,119
you know I don't have a lot of knowledge

2301
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,679
about Electro culture I just see these

2302
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:29,479
Tik Tok videos and Instagram reals where

2303
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:31,239
these guys are like sticking things into

2304
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:33,119
the ground and attaching to the plant

2305
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:36,599
and can you explain to us what electr

2306
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:38,439
culture is and is there any value to it

2307
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,320
does it actually work or is this like

2308
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:42,919
not something that works whatsoever yeah

2309
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:44,319
and electr culture is interesting

2310
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,760
because you know like we just talked

2311
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,599
about with um with bird chps and with

2312
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,560
noises you know that came out of a

2313
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,880
university in the in the 1980s you know

2314
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,880
so there was someone that did actually

2315
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,319
did a lot of work 15 years worth of

2316
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,119
research and he was able to demonstrate

2317
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:01,158
and and you know prove pretty much that

2318
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,960
there is something at play here um

2319
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:04,279
whether or not he was 100% right is less

2320
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,399
relevant than the fact that he

2321
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:07,479
discovered something worth exploration

2322
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,000
you know there's definitely something

2323
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:10,879
going on let's try to characterize it

2324
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,920
let's try to figure out what's happening

2325
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,760
electrial culture is a little bit older

2326
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:17,199
um probably goes back to like the mid

2327
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,440
1800s maybe the late 1800s people were

2328
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:20,919
trying to figure out if electrical

2329
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:23,039
Fields had any kind of impact on plant

2330
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,760
growth and you know keep in mind this is

2331
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:27,279
before we even knew or you know had a

2332
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,280
very good understanding of NPK

2333
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,719
fertilizer we had no idea what the

2334
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:33,479
Essential Elements were for plant growth

2335
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:34,760
we didn't know calcium from phosphorus

2336
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:36,959
back then you know this stuff was

2337
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,960
characterized much later but the idea

2338
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,399
basically is that with electroculture

2339
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,239
you are creating an electrical field for

2340
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:46,319
the plants typically it's a piece of

2341
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:48,319
copper wire or copper tubing that's used

2342
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:50,759
um in this electrical field will impact

2343
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,759
plant growth or benefit plant growth um

2344
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,560
I think a lot of people misunderstand

2345
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,560
what is actually going on there are some

2346
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,560
benefits that can be associated with it

2347
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,360
but there's so many different like you

2348
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,880
know variables that could happen like if

2349
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:05,759
this then that if that then this there's

2350
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,560
all these like dependencies that get

2351
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,320
formed um I think when we're talking

2352
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,560
about strictly you know electric culture

2353
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:14,000
is intended to create an electrical

2354
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,840
field okay so let's look at that what

2355
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,319
happens when you subject um soil

2356
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,960
particles to an electrical field well if

2357
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:23,198
you have ionized compounds ionized

2358
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,560
elements like ionized calcium ionized

2359
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,039
magnesium or whatever those ions

2360
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,159
actually get affected by the electrical

2361
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:30,920
field and they can actually move a

2362
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:32,599
little bit differently and so the idea

2363
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,880
basically is that yeah electrical Fields

2364
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,120
can actually dovetail into nutrient

2365
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,560
metabolism and plants at large but then

2366
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:42,399
the modifier for that is like yeah but

2367
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:44,159
what if you don't have ionized particles

2368
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,920
in your you don't have ionized atoms

2369
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:49,079
inside of your soil because mostly the

2370
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,000
soil is not full of you know ionized

2371
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:52,760
particles we're dealing with like

2372
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,920
mineralized forms of nitrogen for for

2373
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,960
example not ionized forms of nitrogen

2374
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,600
we're dealing with complexes that are

2375
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,319
more or less stabilized we have this

2376
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,400
sort of like thing charge balance thing

2377
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:04,639
figured out if you amend your soil with

2378
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,599
calcium sulfate you're not dealing with

2379
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,319
ionized calcium at that point and so the

2380
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,760
electrical field is maybe a little bit

2381
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:12,559
less relevant overall I think people

2382
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,560
also misunderstand the electrical field

2383
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,560
by thinking that it directly feeds

2384
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,840
photosynthetic Pathways and that is

2385
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,000
actually not how it works at all um

2386
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,159
plants use the power of the sun they you

2387
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,679
know convert um

2388
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:26,920
light energy into chemical energy

2389
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:28,639
through the electron transport chain but

2390
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,279
the electron transport chain and how

2391
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,279
it's evolved to work in plants is much

2392
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,840
different than a piece of copper wire

2393
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:35,679
and electricity that flows in that

2394
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,679
copper wire the two like very little

2395
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,440
connective tissue between the two of

2396
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,239
them and I think it's also worth

2397
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,359
pointing out that copper itself is

2398
01:22:41,238 --> 01:22:45,238
considered a micronutrient inside of

2399
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:47,719
plants yes it's used for its

2400
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:49,238
electrochemical um properties I believe

2401
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:51,039
this is something we had talked about on

2402
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:52,839
your show last episode but it's

2403
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:55,079
accumulated in small concentration in

2404
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,600
the plants and you know my suspicion

2405
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:59,158
there is that if there was some real

2406
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,760
benefit associated with this generation

2407
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:04,119
of electric field that could help

2408
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,560
stimulate plant growth nature probably

2409
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:07,719
would have found a way to incorporate it

2410
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:10,600
into primary metabolism a little bit

2411
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:12,719
further and to a more you know deep

2412
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,679
extent than it currently is inside of

2413
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:18,359
plants um for very long time now you

2414
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:20,319
know preceding the existence of any

2415
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:22,639
human on earth um plants have been doing

2416
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,279
this photosynthesis thing with no help

2417
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,440
at all from copper wires that have been

2418
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:29,039
stuck into the ground and generating

2419
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:31,879
electrical Fields um electrical Fields

2420
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,880
can also impact the um functioning of

2421
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:36,400
certain like protein complexes and

2422
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,159
certain enzymes but again these types of

2423
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,519
things are typically not found in nature

2424
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,879
and so plants have not really evolved

2425
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,400
ways to optimize being exposed to these

2426
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,319
electrical fields in a way that like

2427
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,439
massively increases their yield or

2428
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,119
quality um that's why the results that

2429
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:52,198
you see out there are so mixed some

2430
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:54,599
people swear by electroculture because

2431
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:56,238
they have 25t tall corn plants and the

2432
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,159
ones that didn't get electroculture are

2433
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:01,238
only four or 5T tall but then there's

2434
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:02,839
other people who do the exact same

2435
01:24:01,238 --> 01:24:04,879
studies basically and they find no

2436
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,199
difference associated with it so I would

2437
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,639
say it's not one of those things that's

2438
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:11,919
like a primary driver I'd say if if you

2439
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:13,520
have ionized nutrition that could

2440
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,199
benefit from being exposed to an

2441
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,080
electrical field then sure you you'd see

2442
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,638
some benefit as far as nutrient

2443
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:20,639
metabolism goes but it's not like this

2444
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,840
hidden portal where you can access

2445
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,400
another level of your plants performance

2446
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:28,000
altogether I think that's that's a

2447
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:29,158
little bit of a myth or misconception um

2448
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,560
but you know there's again there's

2449
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:33,238
something interesting to be um studied

2450
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,400
here and looked at in Greater detail but

2451
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:35,718
I do think we need to better

2452
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,519
characterize what exactly these

2453
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:41,480
electrical fields are and how they work

2454
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,159
in the context of nutrient metabolism um

2455
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:47,000
enzyme activity and certainly the

2456
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,759
biosynthesis of some secondary metabits

2457
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,880
that that might accumulate in higher

2458
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,239
concentrations but I don't think there's

2459
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,000
anything that's really conclusive out

2460
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:55,959
there there it proves it one way or

2461
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,560
another um ultimately plants have

2462
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,520
electron transport chains but that's

2463
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,560
fundamentally different than the way

2464
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,880
that copper conducts electricity and

2465
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,440
creates an electrical field it would be

2466
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,840
interesting to see some future studies

2467
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:08,719
that come out because I know people are

2468
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,279
studying it and I know people are are

2469
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,520
using it and so I look forward to seeing

2470
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:16,118
what uh what people come up with in the

2471
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,239
future wow what an episode this has been

2472
01:25:16,118 --> 01:25:19,238
uh this has been awesome I think it

2473
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,799
might actually be the longest episode

2474
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:23,759
yet we usually don't go this long but I

2475
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,719
wanted to continue because I was just so

2476
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,719
intrigued by this conversation and uh we

2477
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,960
had a long list of things here and I

2478
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,639
think we touched upon a whole bunch of

2479
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,880
different things that is really going to

2480
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:36,118
be valuable to the audience so I

2481
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,760
appreciate you coming on today and I

2482
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:39,158
have a feeling that people in the

2483
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,960
comments are going to be requesting a

2484
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:44,118
part three and I would love to open the

2485
