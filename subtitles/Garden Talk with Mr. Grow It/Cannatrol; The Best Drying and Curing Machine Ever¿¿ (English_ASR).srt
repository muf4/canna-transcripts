and today we're talking the can of troll

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,759
this Dragon curing machine has

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,199
absolutely exploded in my comment

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,879
section recently have you tried the

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,679
Canon troll is the Kinder troll worth it

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
how is the Kinder troll work what do you

10
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,100
think about the Canon troll can a troll

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,839
well I did end up getting one and I'm

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,820
using it right now you can see it right

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,039
behind me right there and I also stop by

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,480
the Canon troll booth at MJ bizcon and

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,560
talk to the inventor and that

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,839
interaction is what I'm going to show

17
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,820
you in today's video before we get into

18
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,979
that though I have been absolutely

19
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,840
flooded with people asking me for a

20
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,179
discount code I spoke to the company and

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,100
they do not do discount codes however

22
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,600
they gave me a link which I'll post on

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,460
the YouTube description section below

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,140
and also put it as a pinned comment

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,539
which will show any sales that they have

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,280
currently and also shows multiple unit

27
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,140
discounts so make sure you click that

28
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,879
link in order to get the best price

29
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,340
possible alright let's warp over to

30
00:00:53,878 --> 00:01:00,198
mjbizcon and talk to the inventor David

31
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,199
sandleman about the cannot roll

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,100
down to wet flower well then you put

33
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,359
your wet flour in close the door

34
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,978
unfortunately we can't have flour here

35
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,859
at the show otherwise it'd be full of

36
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:19,560
nice flowers yeah

37
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,200
and then you close it and basically you

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,560
hit the start button raise the run down

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,719
the display is showing us a very low dew

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,820
point because it is so dry here in Las

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,798
Vegas but you'll see that it'll come

42
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,679
back up to set point once I close the

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,200
door you put the flower in about eight

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,079
days later you have amazing smokable

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
flowers eight days eight days and what

46
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,319
would you set this to what's your

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,900
recommended setting it's all preset so

48
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,839
if you touch this it's already set at 68

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,899
degrees and a 54 degree dew point this

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,000
one was set for a five-day dry cycle and

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,640
then uh oh someone was playing with it

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,618
they left it for a 20-day cure cycle but

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,079
you can leave the flour in here for

54
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,420
months we've had flour in a box for as

55
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,000
much as two years and people are blown

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,060
away at how sticky and supple the flower

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,038
comes out two years later and the longer

58
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,459
you leave flour in here the more it

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,878
cures so what we like to do is we'll do

60
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,860
Harvest take down put it in let it dry

61
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,039
and cure and just leave it in there we

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,040
don't even

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,260
we'll take all the flour out 12 16 weeks

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,378
later when our next Harvest is ready and

65
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:38,039
we'll put it in a Sea Bowl or seal bag

66
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:40,439
or vessel we'll try the next patch then

67
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,239
when that's done in about eight days we

68
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,098
take it and put it in brown paper

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,140
sandwich bags and right on the brown

70
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,419
paper sandwich bag that's not a data

71
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,279
Harvest and the cultivar and then we

72
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,259
take the other that we took out earlier

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,360
to put it in and then over time you

74
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,179
start accumulating nice brown paper

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,379
sandwich bags with the cultivar and the

76
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,480
data Harvest

77
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,518
before you know you might have 10

78
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,560
different cultivars in there and you

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,379
look in there what do we feel like

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,819
smoking today

81
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:11,219
you break off a little piece of the bud

82
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:13,859
but put the bag back in at that point

83
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,719
you want to think about ice cream that

84
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,760
you'll never leave ice cream out on the

85
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,680
counter yeah especially here in Las

86
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,780
Vegas you would never want to leave that

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,360
bag outside because it's going to dry

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,759
yeah take off what you need put the bag

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,099
right back in there close the door and

90
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,780
then enjoy that flower I even like to

91
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,699
take just small pieces in a small

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,519
grinder so I don't have too much ground

93
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,339
flour laying around because you'll see

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,560
over a couple of days how the texture of

95
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,560
that ground flour changes yeah it dries

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,479
and degrades so quickly so that's how

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,219
you know a lot of homeowners use it it's

98
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,658
amazing yeah it's becoming real well

99
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,519
popular I know a lot of my audience is

100
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:52,919
familiar with your brand and this

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,379
product really uh huge help especially

102
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,018
in Las Vegas I currently use a wine

103
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,518
fridge but there's some downsides to a

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,680
wine fridge compared to this right it's

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,500
no comparison because what a

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,780
refrigerator does is it's cooling and

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,299
it's constantly drawing moisture out of

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,000
the air so it will eventually over time

109
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,700
perpetually over dry the flour if you're

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,220
in a sealed jar you're basically just

111
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,738
holding it in a cold space yep you're

112
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,260
not actively maintaining the water

113
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,659
activity and the moisture of the flower

114
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,939
so at that point whatever moisture was

115
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,580
in the flour when it went in the jar is

116
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:32,219
what it is if it was overdriving it's

117
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,439
going to stable over dry if it had too

118
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,139
much moisture you can risk the chance

119
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,478
and mold so you have to burp it but if

120
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,939
you open the jar and let that moist air

121
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,639
out and then close it that flour is

122
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,639
going to rehydrate the jar and get drier

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,259
and then if you burp it again close it

124
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,500
the flower is going to lose more

125
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,259
moisture and yeah and over time that

126
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,839
flour is going to get drier and dryer so

127
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,720
this is actually a dryer this is not

128
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,119
actively actively keeping it hydrated

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,460
because what you're doing is you're

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
starting with the wet loud and we're

131
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,939
maintaining the Target and moisture so

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,340
the flour dries and then lands and holds

133
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,500
it there it comes to equilibrium and

134
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,899
it's now in a stable environment with

135
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,160
the perfect curing conditions so you

136
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,918
don't want it in a jar or anything

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,840
that's why we like brown paper bags they

138
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,418
say Vapor permeable and that way

139
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,459
moisture can freely move between hour

140
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,258
and what's in the box now what about

141
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,239
those Grove bags have you heard of those

142
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,919
we've seen Grove bags and what we

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,680
recommend if someone has a growth bag

144
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,139
and they want to use it in the Box yeah

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
okay so no don't heat seal it don't yeah

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,400
you don't don't want to trap what's in

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,199
the bag you want when you're in this

148
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,538
controlled environment but the water

149
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,879
vapor pressure to freely move between

150
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,159
the flower and the environment we're

151
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,079
creating in the Box as soon as you put

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,660
something sealed in here you sort of

153
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,899
defeating the Gerber yeah great point

154
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,220
the recommended temperature and humidity

155
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,620
a lot of people got the relative

156
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,740
humidity what is the recommended for

157
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,840
drying well we do drying and curing are

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,939
pretty much close to each other yep so

159
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,819
we're holding it around the 68 degree

160
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,939
dry bulb temperature 68 Fahrenheit and a

161
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:20,339
54 degree dew point okay okay we don't

162
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,800
talk much about humidity yeah you show

163
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,719
the humidity down here it's a calculated

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,060
value an interesting thing about

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
humidity it's made up of two variables

166
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,220
so when people say oh I want to control

167
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,799
humidity you really can a good

168
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,319
equivalent with be saying I want to

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,180
control my monthly payment well you

170
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,580
can't control the monthly payment itself

171
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,319
yeah you can control the interest you

172
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,258
can control the principal you can

173
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,819
control the time change any of those and

174
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,979
it's going to change the monthly payment

175
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,319
but you can't change the monthly payment

176
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,120
directly humidity is the same thing

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,580
humidity is made up in the temperature

178
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,560
and it's made up of the amount of water

179
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,019
vapor in the air at the dew point or

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,000
vapor pressure those two make humidity

181
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,038
change either of those the relative

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,019
humidity changes but you can't change

183
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,300
the relative humidity because it's made

184
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,579
up of these two separate items gotcha

185
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,720
yep make sense makes sense well thank

186
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,120
you so much for showing the product

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,560
today appreciate it you're welcome I've

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,079
been using the kinetrol for the past

189
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,060
several months now for storage and I'm

190
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,098
using it right now for drying for the

191
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,500
first time so I really want to hold off

192
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:28,139
on any feedback I give in regards to it

193
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,579
until I complete at least one dry cure

194
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,379
cycle but I want to pass off the

195
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,879
question to you what do you think about

196
