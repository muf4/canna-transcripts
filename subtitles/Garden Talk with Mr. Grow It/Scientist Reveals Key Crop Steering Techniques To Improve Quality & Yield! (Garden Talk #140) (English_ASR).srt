to learn more about what they know about

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,759
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,798

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,840
plant stress responses which is revealed

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,439
in today's topic all about crop steering

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,520

how you doing today yes very well Chris

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
thanks how are you I'm doing pretty good

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
thanks for asking today we're going to

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,959
talk all about crop steering now there

75
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,959
are many things that you can do in the

76
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,000
garden to steer your way to a specific

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,878
result some people do it to achieve a

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,560
higher quality some people do it to

79
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,679
increase yield we're going to get into

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,800
all of that in this episode but first

81
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,480
can you tell us a little bit about

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,040
yourself and kind of how you got into

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,919
gardening sure um so so I started

84
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,560
gardening with my grandfather when I was

85
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,158
like you know single digits he was he

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,920
was a master of Just Like Home grow of

87
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:19,639
every kind so all sorts of vegetables

88
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,919
and fruits and stuff and we were in Bas

89
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,639
in Scotland where the growing season's

90
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,719
quite short it's quite limited it's not

91
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,439
very warm so that was quite it was quite

92
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,000
a good indoctrination and just like

93
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,000
being around plants as a kid but it

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
wasn't until many years later that I got

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,959
kind of seriously involved and got into

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,239
medicinal plants um eventually I started

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,400
uh kind of drove me actually to to study

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,560
genetics I was really fascinated how

99
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,640
some medicinal plants would Express

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,759
certain compounds that weren't really

101
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,798
present or at least not in as much

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,598
abundance in other plants that was one

103
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,879
of the kind of driving questions behind

104
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,919
why I wanted to study genetics so so

105
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,719
that led me on that path and and and

106
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,399
from there I went on to do a PhD in

107
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,680
plant science where

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
concentrated on plant pathogen

109
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,760
interactions um I discovered a classic

110
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,639
enzymes in there and and a in a specific

111
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,798
signaling mechanism which had been

112
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,559
overlooked in the whole Cascade when

113
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,560
when any bacteria is seen by a plant

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,199
cell essentially so that that was really

115
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,319
fun that that that was um a really

116
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,520
competitive side of plant science and

117
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,399
really interesting but I I kind of you

118
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,639
do so much in certain fields and I was

119
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,120
always one for branching out so so from

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,120
there I moved into work on on

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,879
photosynthesis is where we took a

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,959
photosynthetic algae which could

123
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,600
supercharge it CO2 um and basically we

124
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,879
were trying to reverse engineered that

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,720
so we could grow massive crop plants of

126
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,279
of all kinds um and then after after I

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
did that St I joined with seedsman uh

128
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,599
Team essentially they had a few

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,439
different you know sides of the business

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,759
and I was involved in one of the kind of

131
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,680
medicinal um plant side of things that

132
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,439
was was geared towards the legal medical

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,360
industry in the UK um but over time I

134
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,959
did more and more for seeds and their

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,840
Market in the US and was much more got

136
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,918
to do with you know small scale home

137
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,279
cultivation and things like that so it

138
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,038
was a good it good kind of like wide

139
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,879
birth of of of experience so in that

140
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,959
role I I went to like big outside um

141
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,519
grows in the Caribbean or in Spain and

142
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,799
then we did also the kind of small craft

143
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,359
style tents inside you know um around

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,038
different places Canada us and so it was

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,160
good it was a really good wide range of

146
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,439
experience and then finally on on my

147
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,600
story what was a kind of a pinnacle part

148
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,120
was was partner up with jge cantes um

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,000
which was through seedsman as well we

150
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,160
got to know each other we became really

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,160
good friends actually but he's been he's

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
been quite instrumental in in in both my

153
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,479
my understanding and learning side of

154
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,318
things but also in my ability to express

155
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,758
what I'm trying to say because he's got

156
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,680
like 40 years of experience writing

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,840
medical plant books you know and pushing

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,360
it out to to the public there especially

159
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,318
when times where it wasn't so easy let

160
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,879
just say um you know so so that was that

161
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,680
was a you know that's that's me full

162
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,959
circle now now I'm working in a I'm the

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,959
head of cultivation for a for a medical

164
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,519
plants company based in Scotland and

165
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,680
I've also got a few other little

166
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,918
projects going on here and there um in

167
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,598
different different levels yeah awesome

168
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,879
so much formal education background

169
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,759
which is really good from time to time

170
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,079
we have somebody like you that has

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,560
formal education on the podcast and

172
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
people just love it you know getting

173
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,560
real deep into things we're going to get

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,439
real deep into crop steering here in a

175
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,160
minute but yeah I know about you through

176
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,000
seedsman I was introduced to you and you

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,000
have so many good articles on it uh I

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,199
recommend folks to Google Dr Gary Yates

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,478
seedsman and you'll see a whole bunch of

180
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,960
different articles that come up that

181
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,240
he's written lots of good information

182
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,120
some of the things I've actually cherry

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,400
picked out of those articles to bring

184
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,720
within this talk here so I'm excited to

185
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,399
bring that particular information to my

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
audience but let's get into crop

187
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,038
steering can we start with the basics

188
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,080
can you just talk to us like what is

189
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:08,038
crop steering sure um so so crop

190
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,680
steering we all do crop steering to a

191
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,038
certain extent whether we realize it or

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,800
not but essentially it's it's the

193
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:17,279
directing the the way the plant grows

194
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
the the outputs of the plant or

195
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,239
sometimes even the inputs that it's

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
required to make the plant successful so

197
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,759
crop steering is all about kind of

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,599
guiding the parameters in order to get a

199
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,199
specific outcome or a specific um I

200
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,639
would say trait because I'm I'm a

201
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,800
geneticist which basically means you

202
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,199
know a specific expression of the genes

203
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,800
that allow for a certain thing to happen

204
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,160
so so that's essentially what we're

205
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,160
trying to do it can be anything from

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,080
taking a a variety that's specifically

207
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,280
mold resistant but doesn't produce a lot

208
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,399
of you know compounds for example that

209
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,318
are valuable so it's like taking one of

210
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,158
those plants and and and driving it

211
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,280
towards making it more you know

212
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:56,800
medically valuable or something like

213
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,598
that it could be it could be the

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
opposite way as well where you've got a

215
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,560
really good sprad of the compounds

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
you're after when you grow a plant but

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,478
then you want to kind of build in some

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
kind of resilience to that plant which

219
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,680
maybe isn't already there so crop

220
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,680
steering is a little bit about that if

221
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,360
if you combine crop steering with with

222
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,560
kind of you know Advanced phenotyping

223
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,720
then you can really take a seed lot and

224
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,199
really push it in actually several

225
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,879
directions if you you know I always

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,759
always like the analogy of like if you

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,520
give a thousand seeds to you know let's

228
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,720
just scale it back 100 seeds to the same

229
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,560
100 seeds to 10 different people could

230
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,599
all pull something very different out of

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,278
that because they grow in a specific

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,240
environment because they're looking for

233
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,080
something very specific from the plant

234
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,759
and they've actually got S A lot of the

235
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,839
times different standards on what the

236
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,399
what the gauge the performance of the

237
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,080
plant on so you combine all those things

238
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,919
and you sometimes get really really

239
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,160
diverse outcomes and that's what's

240
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,159
happened actually with a lot of the the

241
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,719
poly hybridization that's going on and

242
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,679
and and in our industry for the last you

243
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,519
know 30 40 50 years even like a lot of

244
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,399
that started from a fairly small Jee

245
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,159
pill and it's it's been amazing what's

246
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,360
come out here I mean I'm I'm mind blown

247
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,600
like how how much variety and and

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,360
different ranges of different things

249
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,278
we've got out of that but there's also

250
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,839
still a whole lot more to be tapped into

251
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,639
you know like but anyway I digress but

252
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,399
that that's um combining the phenotyping

253
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,759
with the the crop steering is really The

254
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,559
Sweet Spot to to drive and an outcome

255
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,879
from the plant that you really need or

256
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,919
you or you desire so so that's kind of

257
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,639
the basics of crop steering it sounds

258
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,479
little bit more fancy than actually is

259
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,439
you know it's it's simply managing the

260
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,639
conditions and the response of the plant

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,880
for a specific output essentially that

262
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,879
is a good basic definition of it and

263
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,360
yeah for you expanded I appreciate that

264
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,679
and it is exciting to see different

265
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,039
Expressions that can happen really just

266
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,639
from different seeds you know each seed

267
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,519
is its own pheno and each seed can have

268
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,559
its own expression and it's really cool

269
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,839
to be able to do such as fenal hunts for

270
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,919
example and see these different

271
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,640
expressions it makes gardening fun in my

272
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,958
opinion got a bunch of strawberries

273
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,159
growing in my back Garden right now and

274
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,559
like that I don't know what's the

275
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,039
variation but even within the same plant

276
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,439
the ones that come at slightly different

277
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,078
times they can taste quite different you

278
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,480
know the terpine profile on them seems

279
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,000
to be pretty different and um and I'm

280
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,120
kind of keeping little notes on that and

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,559
it's just super interesting but for now

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,320
I can't work out any pattern at all it's

283
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,639
just it just seems somewhat random you

284
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,519
know that's super interesting so if a

285
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,360
gardener were to start crops steering

286
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,240
what actions would you suggest that they

287
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,278
take in order to make it successful yeah

288
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,440
so I mean it sounds really basic and

289
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,039
simple but listing the criteria that you

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,519
want to meet is is the first thing then

291
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,599
obviously choosing the right variety to

292
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,480
match that is the second thing but

293
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,920
really what you want to do is is figure

294
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,920
out from your grown environment where

295
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,360
your what I call the dials are which

296
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,039
things can you control and change and

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,759
which things can you not the variables

298
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,759
that you can control and the others that

299
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,159
you can't

300
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,399
and then it's working within the

301
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:06,679
confines of them throughout my career

302
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,159
and actually in other you know this just

303
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,439
the versions of my life that I've I've

304
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,399
lived before getting to this point I've

305
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,760
always been what what I call a master of

306
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,839
limited resources so taking a fairly

307
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,360
small amount of tools and be making

308
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,399
something that would be quite unexpected

309
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,320
from from that range of tools and that's

310
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,159
kind of what what what this is all about

311
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,480
as well it's like okay you might only

312
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,958
have a you know 300 watt light and you

313
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,680
might only have a kind of one by one but

314
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,439
what can you do with that and and some

315
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,599
people have really mastered crazy little

316
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,040
kind of niches within that and and

317
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,440
that's really what it's about is about

318
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,919
driving

319
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,040
towards um fulfilling a kind of

320
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,599
potential if you will whatever that may

321
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,759
be and and the Very the variables are so

322
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,639
vast that each one of us can have our

323
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,679
own little specific niche in that sense

324
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,959
you know because it's almost unlimited

325
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,638
when you think about the amount of

326
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,479
variables go into it so yeah I would I

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,919
would say but before you get started so

328
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,079
make your list have an idea the the

329
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,799
dials and then really just start you

330
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:06,919
know reading up finding out as much as

331
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,000
you can about what to do a lot of the

332
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,360
stuff with the plants that we were

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,200
talking about it's not very well known

334
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,079
it's not well documented the science is

335
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,680
a little bit behind but we've got

336
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,078
examples from other plants and we've got

337
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,479
an experience and we've got the kind of

338
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,879
the greatest thing about this community

339
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,560
is the just the powery numbers the

340
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,078
amount of people who are out there doing

341
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,759
it for themselves and feed them back so

342
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,198
so that's what you really want to do is

343
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,639
is keep on course with all your

344
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,799
parameters but then understand where you

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
can change those and and and lead them

346
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,399
to the kind of the outcomes that you

347
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,439
want does that does that answer the

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,480
question yeah absolutely all right so

349
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,199
let's hop into the different stages of

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,759
growth and kind of the triggers that you

351
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,838
can do in order to crop steer right so

352
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,958
let's start with the seedling stage

353
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,760
lighting environment conditions

354
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,000
irrigation nutrition all these things

355
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,799
can be adjusted when you're crop

356
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,240
steering right so maybe let's start with

357
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,599
lighting know what do you recommend for

358
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,278
say the amount of par or

359
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,159
Spectrum yeah so so one one thing I

360
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,120
would like to break down with the light

361
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,399
before we actually go into the specifics

362
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,480
like that is is I think we mentioned

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,039
before this this um this this chat that

364
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,278
um one of the things I got interested in

365
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,958
was the different quality of light from

366
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,000
indoor from outdoor from glass house and

367
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,399
what's really interesting is like and I

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,440
know I know this from my time working in

369
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,519
photosynthesis the par range is like

370
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,760
it's like trimmed at the ends at both

371
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,560
ends it doesn't include the UV Spectrum

372
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,919
it doesn't include the kind of far Red

373
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,119
Spectrum which is just like it's just an

374
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,838
interesting point because my

375
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,198
understanding physiology both of those

376
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
things are pretty important um and if

377
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,799
you just went by the textbooks you would

378
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,838
say oh well you can't do without them

379
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,919
but we know from experience you can very

380
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,519
well do without them both you know

381
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,278
generations of of Horticultural plants

382
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,839
that have been growing in glass houses

383
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,799
all sorts of things from fruits and

384
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,560
vegetables right through to you know

385
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,639
medicinal plants and and also indoor as

386
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,439
well we know that the horiculture

387
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,519
markets Thrive without the the needs for

388
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,399
these clipped spectrums if you will um

389
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,198
so so that that's one thing to consider

390
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,759
though it's like Again part of crop

391
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,039
steering is understanding like so for

392
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,480
the seedling stage and for lightting if

393
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,078
you've got a kind of harsh environment

394
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,720
like I would suggest that you try and

395
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,359
sew your seeds in quite a harsh

396
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,040
environment which what does that mean

397
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,159
okay this if it's kind of cold do it on

398
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,000
a window ledge so it's inside but warm

399
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,919
but not extremely warm and try and get

400
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,879
the seeds to germinate germinate at a

401
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,439
little bit lower temperature that bows

402
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,039
in a hardiness um giving them exposure

403
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,480
to the outside early on as well really

404
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,719
helps build up their stress resistance

405
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,560
for for the future so that you've got

406
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,320
things like wind resistance that they

407
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,638
build up so they they tend to be a

408
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,199
little bit stockier if you put them out

409
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,278
right if you're growing um for was the

410
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,838
next one I was going to say yeah for

411
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,919
like I said with the UV light so so UV

412
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,040
being light triggers a bunch of stress

413
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:06,799
responses in the plant which actually

414
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,599
changes gene expression quite um quite a

415
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,758
way actually and there's a lot of things

416
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,399
like it will do it will help with UV

417
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,519
protection actually believe it or not

418
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,919
which is is ironic but it will also help

419
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,360
with things like DNA repair so whenever

420
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,958
there is damage to the cells from other

421
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,879
you know whether it be chemicals in the

422
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,198
ground whether it be you know extreme UV

423
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,958
that the plant can actually repair

424
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,559
itself a lot more readily if it's been

425
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,399
exposed to UV uh

426
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,198
be light so so understanding that is

427
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,120
important first of all is that you know

428
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,519
what do you want to try and Achieve here

429
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,759
if you've got a harsh environment you

430
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
want to prepare your seedling to be

431
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,199
ready for that otherwise if you've got a

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,679
perfect environment however then what

433
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,599
you want to do is is literally live

434
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,559
pretty much by your favorite textbook or

435
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,360
your favorite you know whatever light

436
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,518
manufacturer you you've chosen go by

437
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,639
there by what they say I found that

438
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,480
often times the best thing to do is just

439
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,198
stick to the you know what says on the

440
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,600
tin to quote an old advert um so so but

441
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,958
but generally what you want from from

442
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,040
the seeding stage is a lot of blue light

443
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,838
compared to Red Light plenty Green in

444
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,559
there not too intense probably I mean

445
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,480
like just germinating seeds as it just

446
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,638
comes out like maybe 200 micro moles um

447
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,839
of light in terms of in you know

448
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,198
intensity I don't know if that's a a

449
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,199
thing you understand micro mes per met

450
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,000
squar per second for example um so so

451
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,919
that's what you would um you know you

452
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,078
would keep it on that now if you wanted

453
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,318
to like I say make your plant ready for

454
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,239
for the a harsher environment and you

455
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,360
can't you know have a hybrid indoor

456
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
outdoor way doing it then a UVB lamp

457
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,639
which is now quite readily available

458
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,639
with a lot of the LED setups is is

459
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,000
probably worthwhile because like I said

460
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,600
it gives it it doesn't necessarily at

461
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,399
that stage increase anything in terms of

462
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
the the the medicinal compounds or the

463
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,519
overall yield but what it can do is

464
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,959
buffer against some of those stresses

465
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,839
that are harder to manage um which you

466
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,359
know you're basically giving your plant

467
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,679
a a little bit of a a head start in

468
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,958
terms of resisting you know various

469
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,880
types of stress by adding in that UV

470
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,000
light so that that would be my we little

471
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,360
kind of top tip on on the seedling stage

472
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,798
would would introduce something you know

473
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,639
in the in the kind of like low blue

474
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,838
Spectrum into the UVC UVB um especially

475
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,319
because that that would trigger a a a

476
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,678
light comp a light complex called uvr8

477
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,359
and this was like um only discovered in

478
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,600
like I don't know the two early 2000s um

479
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,639
something like that was actually in the

480
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,759
lab in Glasgow that discovered it um

481
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,240
during my undergrad so so that's why

482
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,000
I've got a little bit of insight on that

483
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,798
that protein but it regulates a bunch of

484
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,440
things um and if it's not activated you

485
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,440
still get activation of those things

486
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,120
that regulates but you don't get such a

487
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,880
strong response so that's sometimes I've

488
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,199
seen plants chosen for their their

489
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,799
specific pheno and then they're grown

490
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,720
under glass and the and they don't they

491
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:03,639
seem really susceptible to different you

492
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,200
know stresses and this is one of the

493
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,360
reasons why CU they're not having that

494
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,200
UVB Activation so so sorry to kind of go

495
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,798
on about that but it kind of sets us up

496
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,120
for talking about light for the for the

497
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:16,839
next phases of light as life as well

498
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,359
really good tips really good tips I

499
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,879
appreciate you uh expanding on that and

500
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,918
I also appreciate how you mentioned the

501
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,320
textbook par range and how that's really

502
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,799
a bit outdated right they say par 400 to

503
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:34,038
700 nanometers but the plant can utilize

504
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:38,759
Beyond 700 nanometers and lower than 400

505
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:40,919
nomers right UV IR or bar red so yeah

506
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,359
I'm glad you brought that up because you

507
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,440
know a lot of people do know it but not

508
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,000
everybody knows it people might still be

509
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,038
referring to the textbook which is a bit

510
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,558
outdated but yeah there is an extended

511
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:55,279
range now that we know that it does have

512
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:57,599
an impact on the plants yeah I mean the

513
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,558
so most are clipped at 700 nanometers

514
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,279
you're right but the there's a comp

515
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:05,279
there's a light receptor called um pyto

516
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,480
Chrome B and it needs to see far red

517
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:11,038
which is 730 so this this compound can

518
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,240
see two two different spectrums of light

519
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,558
and it needs the other one to convert it

520
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,359
back to to being ready to receive and

521
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,639
one's an active form and one's an

522
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,719
inactive form and if you can't activate

523
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,640
it then what happens is the gene can

524
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,240
overproduce it because it's it's not

525
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,320
getting that switch back and forth at

526
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,240
the protein level so the light would

527
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,240
normally switch this protein back and

528
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,000
forth and that helps regulate the

529
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,279
processes if you don't have that the

530
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,319
gene then the compensation for that is

531
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,918
to over produce the protein do you see

532
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,240
what I mean so that I don't know what

533
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,480
effect that is it's not really been

534
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,679
largely you know it's not been hugely um

535
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,919
explored but that is one of the the the

536
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,880
the the mechanisms that would be

537
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,559
affected by by capping your your your

538
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,640
your your power range at 700 um and it's

539
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,359
like I say it's the same at the other

540
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,440
end they got you know having a peak of I

541
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,959
like a blue Peak like 355 maybe even you

542
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,919
know a we bit lower than that so some of

543
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,279
them capped at four is crazy even light

544
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,280
receptors work um some of the kind of uh

545
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,639
light receptors involved in specific

546
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,240
processes outside photosynthesis they

547
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,400
they're they're activated lower than

548
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,359
that as well which is um you know like

549
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,880
right down to 280 down in the UV so it's

550
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,479
crazy that that's completely missing

551
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,080
from a lot of the stuff but yet the

552
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,558
stuff still grows pretty well you know

553
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,759
think that's it kind of my mind how you

554
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,519
can have you know we say You must have

555
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,599
this but you can kind of get away with

556
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,519
not having it you know yeah the plants

557
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,519
will adapt for sure right now how about

558
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,720
nutrition you know generally speaking in

559
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,319
the seedling stage it's often said that

560
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,000
nitrogen should be more heavier than

561
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,000
some of the other elements would you

562
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,319
agree with that disagree do you have any

563
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,240
tips in regards to that I mean like so

564
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,798
personally my favorite way to you know

565
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,720
the way I've had the best results is

566
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,599
actually just to have a hands off

567
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,839
approach if you can get a really good

568
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,678
soil mix just leave it just water it and

569
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,759
just let it go that's what I've found

570
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,400
that gives me the best cuz then what

571
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,079
happens is between the microbes and the

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,278
and the soil and the plant itself they

573
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,839
kind of they kind of steer themselves to

574
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,679
what they need and what they want is

575
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,158
what I've found again without without

576
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,320
kind of getting scientific about it

577
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,760
because I can't back that up necessarily

578
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,879
with science but but my observation is

579
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,038
that when when you have a good soil

580
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,960
based system the plant seems to just you

581
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,960
know take care of itself you you don't

582
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,519
see much signs of any of these issues

583
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,360
you do in a hydroponic system where

584
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,879
everything's really tightly regulated

585
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,719
and if you have even just a change in

586
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,240
temperature of your nutrient you can

587
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,200
have a pH change and then you know you

588
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,798
can see the effects and in the plant so

589
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,640
I like a soil based system for that

590
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:54,200
getting a really good mix um Jorge

591
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,520
cantes put me on to chicken manure as a

592
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,120
as a good um additive to soil as well

593
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,400
and I've been experimenting with that

594
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,278
this year the effects have been

595
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,278
tremendous absolutely tremendous I was

596
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,038
really surprised but um but otherwise

597
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,200
yeah there's a thing about having high

598
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,558
nitrogen I I don't know they kind like a

599
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,720
balanced blend throughout you know like

600
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,038
that I think that's the point I'm trying

601
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,400
to make through all is like I kind of

602
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,879
like I don't want to be messing about

603
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,519
guessing what the plant needs as it

604
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,720
grows you know like that's I think

605
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,639
because again not a lot of that's based

606
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,919
on science a lot of that's just based on

607
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,720
what people before us did and we're kind

608
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,278
of just following suit even but just a

609
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,798
step back to the light a lot of old

610
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:34,400
school ways of thinking is that you

611
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,359
increase light intensity up until like

612
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
week eight and then you can and all this

613
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,399
and it's it's just nonsense that's not

614
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
how it works at all like you just blast

615
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,360
it with as much light as it can take for

616
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,960
as long as it can take it because that's

617
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,278
what happens outdoor in the Sun and

618
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,960
that's what they evolve from you know so

619
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,159
that that's the best way to attack that

620
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,720
as well I always try and find the I'll

621
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,679
always take the light to the highest

622
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,679
level I can to until I see a stress

623
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
response in the plants and then dial it

624
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
back a little bit

625
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,519
that because that little stress response

626
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,319
actually helps them to take more light

627
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,720
heavier amount of light in the future as

628
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,918
well so that's another little kind of

629
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,960
crop steering tip is if you want your

630
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,960
plants to take a bit more light than

631
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,079
they have done previously if even if

632
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,759
you're in a clone mother cycle you can

633
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,079
actually train your plant to be

634
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,440
highlight responsive again the genotype

635
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,720
will dictate how how far you can push

636
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,480
that but if you expose your your young

637
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,480
plant to a like intermittent high

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,360
intensity light when you put it into for

639
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,278
example flour and you give it a little

640
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,798
bit more than than you had done before

641
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,798
it should be able to cope with a little

642
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,519
bit better and there's there's a whole

643
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,000
bunch of epigenetic effects in there

644
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,000
that are you know it's basically

645
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,759
controlling different gen expression

646
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,319
mechanisms and again preempting them

647
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,960
seems to be somehow it's like I can of

648
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:50,599
we used to when I was training or when I

649
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,000
was at Uni they called it um plant

650
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,480
memory things like this you know like

651
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,159
this this idea that the plant can

652
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,880
remember if you give it certain stresses

653
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,520
when it's young the plant will remember

654
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,360
that when it's old older but what it

655
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,200
actually means is it can it can shortcut

656
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,079
the response you know it doesn't have to

657
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,919
like learn what's going on and then

658
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,519
respond to it's already done it kind of

659
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,720
like our immune system right when we've

660
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,879
been immunized or exposed to a bug

661
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,919
before we have those antibodies and we

662
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,919
just we can get rid of it much quicker

663
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,919
it's kind of like that without being

664
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,159
similar in mechanism but it's it's like

665
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,640
that in in concept if you know what I

666
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,600
mean um but yeah sorry I deviate but

667
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,159
nutrient is um yeah I like I like hands

668
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,038
off with my nut Trent I don't like to

669
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,600
overpower it um and again the light I go

670
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,119
for top down but the nutr I go bottom up

671
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,599
if you understand what I mean I tend to

672
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,639
be light on the nutrient and and see and

673
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,678
build it up um rather than go with what

674
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,759
what's the most you can take in that by

675
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,840
down because again it's just you don't

676
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,759
have much of a chance to fix it if you

677
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,599
go way over you know if you go a little

678
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,319
bit under you can you can catch up in a

679
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,079
few days um with with nutrients so yeah

680
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,720
no massive tips there for me other than

681
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,519
just think try and try and get a good

682
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,640
mix a good uh depending on your

683
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,480
substrate but try and get a good mix of

684
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,278
the nutrients that you want throughout

685
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,120
the veg period and give it that from the

686
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:13,240
start is what I would say understood now

687
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,439
how about the vegetative stage do you

688
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,440
have any tips for crop steering in the

689
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,360
vegetative stage so so yeah like so

690
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,640
there's a couple here like if you wanted

691
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,240
to have and again this is a little bit

692
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,360
plant training as well right but if you

693
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,679
wanted to have like only like what the

694
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:34,079
used to call triaa grade you know um

695
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,399
finish let's just say then then we you

696
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,199
can condition your plants for different

697
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,798
styles of of cultivation different

698
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,600
cultivation techniques so for example in

699
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,319
a vegetative day if you wanted to grow

700
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,759
what we call the sea of green style

701
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:49,398
which I'm sure you you'll know which is

702
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,558
lots of plants close together you make

703
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:53,759
this kind of like literal sea of green

704
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:55,480
because there's no space anywhere

705
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,798
there's a really good econom again

706
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,440
depending on the scale you're on

707
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,759
depending on what outcomes you want it's

708
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,519
a really good way of of of of achieving

709
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,319
like a a fast turnaround consistent

710
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,519
quality you know if you have the Clone

711
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,038
numbers going in there and you kind of

712
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,639
even just do a single Cola on each plant

713
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:13,759
you can get like really high levels of

714
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,399
consistency so that's good for like you

715
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,759
know for the medical industry for

716
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,079
example who have like kind of really

717
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,158
tight tolerances on what the what the um

718
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,119
the compound level sh could be so so you

719
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,679
know so if you're going to grow for for

720
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,639
sea of greenic for example you can you

721
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,159
basically want to ramp your light again

722
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,080
back to light you want to ramp your

723
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,320
light up um pretty quickly in vegetable

724
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,639
in vegetation because you probably got a

725
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,240
short veg of time right so you want that

726
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,399
plant to put on as much mass as possible

727
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,599
so that was the other thing I was going

728
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,599
to get with veg um so rather than the

729
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,519
nutrient itself I'll talk about the

730
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,959
watering schedule if I may um so so

731
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,079
combining that like highlight with a

732
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,319
really good watering strategy something

733
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,639
that's massively overlooked in this B A

734
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:02,398
lot um you you can you can steer a lot

735
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,679
of the crop with how you water it um and

736
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:05,038
again whether there's feed in the water

737
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,399
or that doesn't matter it's just the

738
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,200
scheduling of of delivering you know the

739
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:14,119
liquid to the plant's feet let's just

740
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,640
say um so for for if you want the plants

741
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:19,079
to grow fast you know like and really

742
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,278
push them on like lots of short burs of

743
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,119
of of of feeder water early on in the in

744
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,119
the day that's what I've found that you

745
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,000
know just if they're if all in all

746
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,038
they're going to consume say I don't

747
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,839
know

748
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,278
eight ounces in the day that just say

749
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,079
small right they got to do eight ounces

750
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,519
you would do like two and two and two

751
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,839
and two right so rather than do all

752
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,639
eight at once or go four at the start

753
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,639
and four halfway through you just do two

754
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,880
short ones or or sorry four short ones

755
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,278
of two throughout the throughout each

756
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,640
day I found that that pushes the plants

757
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:55,159
on especially um linearly you know in

758
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,000
height not not necessarily in bushiness

759
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,840
but that kind of pushes the growth rate

760
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,519
up so again if doing single Cola and you

761
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,879
want you know a good epical bud there

762
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,640
and you're going to strip away a lot of

763
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,760
the the secondary and tertiary you know

764
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,600
growth that's that's what would be my

765
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,640
advice for that if you want to Bush the

766
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,719
plant out in veg then two shots early

767
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,159
Two Shots late bigger do shots um is

768
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,519
what I would suggest with your watering

769
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,840
schedule there so those kind of two

770
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,278
different you know different types of

771
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,119
accelerator I would say um but you can

772
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,278
start to get a response from those

773
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,599
especially um the first one with the

774
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,319
short bus often you can get that

775
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,759
response out of the the vegetating

776
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,960
plants pretty quickly you can see the

777
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:39,240
difference um it's a bit

778
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,240
counterintuitive to do short short

779
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,519
amount of of watering because but what

780
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,359
basically happens is if you if you will

781
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,359
the mechanism is you don't give the

782
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,519
plant enough it creates more root hairs

783
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,798
in sear your water and you just get you

784
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,720
you're just giving it enough you know to

785
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,158
to to to give it enough water but it's

786
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,319
also pushing itself to try and find more

787
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,399
water at the same time which means that

788
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,359
it overall in ability to update water

789
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:05,558
increases you know it's supposed to giv

790
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,359
it a big shot where it's sitting in it

791
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,240
its own water it doesn't need to go

792
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,319
searching for it all day the root The

793
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,319
Roots don't tend to expand at the same

794
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,558
rate when you do that um but that's a

795
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,079
technique you want to use in in

796
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:19,359
flowering because you don't really want

797
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,839
to be gaining root mass and fling

798
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,599
necessarily you want to have built your

799
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,038
root mass by that point ideally um you

800
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,519
know and you want all the growth and all

801
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,558
the energy to be going into the top of

802
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,200
the plant um so yeah that's that's kind

803
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,678
of combining your your irrigation and

804
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,720
your nutrient there again I'm light on

805
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,798
the feed I like you know getting getting

806
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,640
the water and right and getting the

807
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,639
substrate right you'll have absolutely

808
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
no problems through veg you know that's

809
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
what I've found it's generally the I

810
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,480
like the early stage of Life a lot of

811
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,919
people like the Finish but I I really

812
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,159
like the early stage the first like 21

813
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,720
days I just think it's phenomenal speed

814
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,760
of growth and amount of change from this

815
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,600
little Pip into this like you know

816
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,480
sometimes like 10 in 12p and you're just

817
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,038
like what how did that do that in that

818
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,200
space of time you know yeah these plants

819
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,480
grow so quickly it's it's incredible and

820
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,720
appreciate the advice on the irrigation

821
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,759
on that Avenue now some people believe

822
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,759
in drought stress as far as I've heard

823
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,319
claims as much as it brings out the

824
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,960
secondary metabolites more is there any

825
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,639
truth to that or is that just Bro

826
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,159
Science um I've not come across any

827
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,120
studies suggesting that I I I do like um

828
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,640
the dryback technique you know like when

829
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,959
when you potting up and stuff like that

830
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,519
and let the plant pretty much dry out

831
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,960
that's pretty much that's what we're

832
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,038
referring to yeah yeah like so so that

833
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,159
that for potting up I like um I'm not

834
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,359
sure that I I just like it because it

835
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,080
helps the roots expand into the new pot

836
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,000
you know they be be beyond that I don't

837
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,798
know what it does to I can't can't

838
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,720
imagine what it does to tune the the

839
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,599
secondary metabolite um Pathways but but

840
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,558
we we we know so little about that it's

841
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,558
possible you know it's it's possible

842
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:00,960
that something there is is connected um

843
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,398
Sciences are nothing else surprising a

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,720
lot of the times when you when when

845
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,079
these connections are made um like the

846
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
ones about I don't know if you've ever

847
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,038
looked up to um mechano stimulation

848
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,679
which is a technique where you basically

849
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,798
create vibrations around or on the plan

850
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,240
and and again that's reported to

851
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,960
increase all sorts of secondary

852
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,919
metabolites and stuff and there's a

853
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,798
there's companies Now set up to go come

854
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,399
to your facility and set up mechano

855
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:28,200
vibration you know simulators and stuff

856
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,439
like that so there's all sorts s of

857
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,440
things that we don't understand yet so

858
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,240
yeah it's possible but I've not seen any

859
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,720
evidence for that yet so much more to

860
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,359
uncover yeah it's incredible that's one

861
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,558
thing that makes this plant so much fun

862
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,079
cultivating it at least is like not

863
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,359
everything has been uncovered new things

864
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,079
are being identified so uh yeah I I love

865
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,079
keeping up to date on that stuff you

866
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,519
touched upon plant training a little bit

867
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,359
but I want to get a little bit deeper

868
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,960
cuz in one of the Articles you wrote you

869
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:57,359
mentioned plant training changes gene

870
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,798
expression can you talk to us a little

871
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,199
bit about that

872
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,480
yeah I think I think some context and a

873
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,480
little bit of background on how genes

874
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,720
are expressed is is relevant without

875
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,519
getting too technical about it um people

876
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,519
forget that and plant has DNA of course

877
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,638
right um but the they have an entire

878
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,278
genome in every single cell of their

879
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:24,199
their entire existence right so every

880
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,798
cell every cell that makes up the roots

881
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,399
every cell that makes up you know the

882
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:30,440
stem the leaf the thing each one of them

883
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:33,158
has its own genome so and each one of

884
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,200
those cell types have a different way of

885
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,278
Express expressing The genome right so

886
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,240
they have different genes that are

887
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:40,119
active versus ones that are inactive in

888
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,960
other tissue types and that's true in

889
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,479
cell types as well it's why a flow is a

890
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,200
flower and a Root's a root right they

891
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,558
start from the same essentially the same

892
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,679
precursor but they deviate down the line

893
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,720
cell division and and and and

894
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,679
differentiation so so when you um when

895
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,000
you have when you say oh there's a gene

896
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,038
expression change doesn't always mean

897
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,440
throughout the entire plant sometimes it

898
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,079
can be loc locally to the area that

899
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,679
you're talking about so that that's just

900
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,278
a little bit of Preamble that I wanted

901
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,559
to give in qualification to that if you

902
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,159
if you cut a plant for example doesn't

903
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,918
mean necessarily mean that every every

904
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,480
cell expresses its jeans now differently

905
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,360
you know but there can be big changes at

906
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,839
the site where you made that where you

907
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,240
made that cut but there is also

908
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,000
signaling mechanisms that do go

909
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,120
throughout the plant and it can prime

910
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,319
the plant for like I say stress

911
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,558
resistance and stuff like that so your

912
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,798
your specific example if you are you

913
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,960
know if you're taking if you're taking a

914
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,918
clone um you injur the plant okay you

915
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,399
you cut through the plant um branch and

916
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,240
then you take the Clone away now forget

917
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,678
about the Clone what happened what

918
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,919
happened at that site that you cut so

919
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,960
the plant has a wound response mechanism

920
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,600
that's evolved for millions of years

921
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,558
this has got to do this is this is a a

922
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:59,759
kind of an advanc an advancement on the

923
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,918
tra of um or ISM so like you know

924
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,519
whether it be a small animal or insect

925
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,159
that chew on the plant that eats the

926
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,798
plant for for its dietary needs um the

927
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,599
plants have got a response to that

928
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:12,039
whether it be producing certain

929
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,159
compounds that will repel them you know

930
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:16,279
different tast whether it be some plants

931
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,559
have developed like spikes and needles

932
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,720
like stingy nles for example to try and

933
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,358
you know repel that so so they have like

934
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,118
a whole you know tens and tens of

935
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,199
millions of years of evolution hundreds

936
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,399
of millions of years of evolution behind

937
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,799
those me mechanisms right so so that's

938
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,239
the other thing to bear in mind it's

939
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,240
like when we taking a cutting it's

940
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,158
nothing new to the plant you know the

941
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,878
plants you know as well is well ready

942
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,398
for for for an injury like that but what

943
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,078
we can do there is we can we can make

944
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,719
the

945
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,440
injury um in a specific way at a

946
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,000
specific time that we can try and direct

947
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,398
some of that expression and and changes

948
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,199
in gene expression so

949
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,118
like this a like the wound response

950
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,399
mechanism itself right like that's

951
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,960
that's a good one to preactivate so the

952
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,358
earlier that you can pinch out or top a

953
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,720
plant generally the more Hardy and

954
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,759
resilient the plant becomes to that

955
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,319
specific thing again back to your crop

956
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,240
steering right if you want it's not

957
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,760
necessarily that you need to do it now

958
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:17,439
but you want it to be able to do it

959
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,440
later so injuring the plant early on in

960
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,720
that respect can change the gene

961
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,000
expression so that we get a better

962
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,239
response the next time you see it's this

963
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,880
kind of same mechanism as I was talking

964
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,559
about earlier the conditioning I mean

965
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,039
it's it's it's the same formula the

966
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,119
plant you know the plant knows what it's

967
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,639
doing um so so yeah that that that

968
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,519
that's in that sense it changes

969
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:41,319
expression so what what we have now in

970
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,759
that um in that site of injury is a

971
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,680
plant has to now decide what it's going

972
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,520
to do with that with that site so the

973
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,759
first thing is it has to close it up to

974
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,400
stop infection right so you got a bunch

975
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
of genes activated there that weren't

976
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,639
activated before in order to to

977
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,880
basically heal that wound then what you

978
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,879
normally get is is New Growth that come

979
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,000
from there you know the kind of classic

980
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,760
thing is if you take a a bit of a branch

981
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,719
away to make a clone you have two new

982
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,599
ones that appear from that that's an

983
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,759
interesting change in expression as well

984
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,400
because you've went you you've each

985
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,480
although there's a like a what we call

986
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,280
the epical mer stem which is like you

987
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,079
know the tallest part of the plant is is

988
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,040
where the the main Suite of uh stem

989
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,519
cells are in the plant but it's also

990
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,480
true that on each branch you have an

991
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,880
epical kind of dominance as you go up

992
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,800
and down that that Branch itself so when

993
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,599
you take away that epical dominance from

994
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,160
even a branch not even the full plant

995
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,599
just from that Branch what happens is

996
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,399
because it re um starts back from the

997
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,240
the kind of the stem cell say the merry

998
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,639
stem

999
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,759
cell because the plant symmetrical you

1000
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,400
end up with two so we we know this

1001
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,400
phenomenon right when you take a cut you

1002
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,079
often get two that grow back so that's

1003
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,599
what's happening there you're changing

1004
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,119
not actually that's actually has to do

1005
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,720
with gene expression and actually more

1006
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,358
to do with how the cells differentiate

1007
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,039
you know because you've set them on a

1008
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,799
pathway but it's triggered by the fact

1009
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,759
that you've caused this wound so it's

1010
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,839
all like a series of of gene expression

1011
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,359
protein um receptors and you know it's a

1012
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:10,960
big feedback loop which one action

1013
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,119
results in another action results in

1014
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,159
another action and often that does

1015
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,960
result in a series of gene expression

1016
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:20,000
changes so very literally that's what

1017
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,358
that means but then a little bit more

1018
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,400
kind of holistically it's it's about you

1019
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:25,880
know readying the plant for the

1020
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,480
different types of things that's to come

1021
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,480
as well IE more stress you know and

1022
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,679
that's how you

1023
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,880
can mitigate the stress response because

1024
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,318
some things you want a stress response

1025
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,079
some things you want you don't want the

1026
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:39,279
stress response you want to be able to

1027
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,119
do things and the plant just keeps

1028
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,720
growing doesn't care right and that's

1029
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,079
the whole big battle between pathogen

1030
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:50,358
and yield pathogen resistance sorry in

1031
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,640
yield pathogen resistance is great but

1032
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,318
sometimes what happens if the plant

1033
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,559
doesn't defend itself and it just keeps

1034
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:57,920
growing it ends up decimated at the end

1035
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,119
right because it's it's been been by

1036
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,280
this this bug or whatever on the other

1037
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,920
hand um if the plant's susceptible to it

1038
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,480
what it does is it shuts down it doesn't

1039
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,440
grow it redirects its energy reserves

1040
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,679
and tries to fight off the the infection

1041
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,639
in the best it can or it shuts down that

1042
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,559
side of the plant and tries to regrow

1043
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:17,199
somewhere else you know they can another

1044
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,279
half of the plant because it it knows

1045
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,159
that's compromised and plants are also

1046
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,319
really good at killing themselves so

1047
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,118
like locally they'll kill certain cells

1048
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:28,000
to stop this the spread infection and

1049
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,880
that can actually be you know quite

1050
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,960
widespread a plant can actually just

1051
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,720
program it's called program sell death

1052
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,599
and just like completely like destroy

1053
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,598
itself in order to save itself um you

1054
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,400
know and and again different parts of

1055
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,240
the plant will do that you even see it

1056
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,318
with like a bit out stretch but the same

1057
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,279
thing is is like when the when the wel

1058
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:50,079
leaves it's a kind of similar thing

1059
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,480
right it's okay that's done now we just

1060
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,400
cut off the supply that slowly pinch it

1061
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,318
and then it just it's no longer getting

1062
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,880
any nutrients from the stem and it

1063
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,719
wethers and dies and drops off so it's

1064
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,358
the same kind of thing you know slightly

1065
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,919
different but it's the same kind of

1066
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,239
thing that's wild yeah have a bu who

1067
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,159
super crops every single branch and he

1068
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:11,559
does it very early in the vegetative

1069
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:13,679
stage and he right he swears that it

1070
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,119
helps make the plant more Hardy and you

1071
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,838
just kind of confirm that there is

1072
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,039
science to back it that uh if you're

1073
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,799
doing this type of damage early on it's

1074
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,719
it's going to build up some sort of like

1075
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,039
resistance right some hardiness to it so

1076
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,159
that that's really cool to hear about

1077
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,920
the details on how that works

1078
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,358
yeah it's also gen again genotype

1079
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,760
specific right what which variety you

1080
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,960
have some will not take it so well

1081
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,400
because some of overreact to that but if

1082
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,000
you get the right variety and the right

1083
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,880
person's hands as well I must say

1084
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,519
because you some of these things are

1085
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,760
quite a delicate touch even although

1086
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,199
they they seem extreme you know um but

1087
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,079
yeah that's what I'm saying there

1088
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,358
there's such there's a lane for everyone

1089
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,318
the variables are so vast it's it's a

1090
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,559
fascinating study like you know I've

1091
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:59,679
seen all sorts of crazy things people do

1092
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:01,519
and and I say if you get results then

1093
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,480
keep doing it if there's no science to

1094
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,358
back it up doesn't matter there's a guy

1095
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,400
who drives nails through his his stems

1096
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:11,318
there's a guy who what was it he does it

1097
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,160
really likes to use like warm animal

1098
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:15,880
blood you know for for feed in the soil

1099
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,920
yeah they just strange things like that

1100
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,318
and they swear by these things and like

1101
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,318
yeah there's all sorts of crazy things

1102
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:24,358
we've come across um oh I can't think

1103
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,440
anymore now but they some just really

1104
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:30,159
wild stuff you know um but again you

1105
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,559
probably you're probably elic eliciting

1106
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,639
a response from the plant which could be

1107
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,078
otherwise attained you see what I mean

1108
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,239
like it doesn't necessarily always need

1109
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,000
to be that extreme to to get that

1110
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:44,479
response um but yeah that that's really

1111
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,280
cool the super cropping thing is um yeah

1112
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,000
but I bet he he gets a lot of yield as

1113
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,280
well from from doing that right because

1114
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,920
you got a lot of really good kind of top

1115
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,160
buds essentially yeah he you know one of

1116
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,838
the main reasons why he does that is

1117
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,838
because it helps with the strengthening

1118
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,400
of the branches he claims so when the

1119
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,239
you get into the flower stage and youve

1120
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,880
got all these buds on the plant there's

1121
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,799
less flopp of those branches cuz it's

1122
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,559
they're stronger from that super crop

1123
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,318
early on at least that's what that's

1124
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,039
what he claims so I thought that was

1125
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,599
interesting yeah that is super

1126
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,639
interesting but yeah so so plant

1127
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,280
training in general like is you're doing

1128
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,318
two things you're basically

1129
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,920
restructuring the architecture of the

1130
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:24,838
plants to suit yourself but you're also

1131
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,800
then conditioning it to be able to take

1132
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,599
that and to be you know maybe like

1133
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,519
heavier Branch um yielding because it

1134
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,359
can take the weight I remember like the

1135
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,358
first plants that we ever grew um they

1136
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,279
were like extremely floppy we didn't

1137
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,039
know what we were doing like everything

1138
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,280
was FL you needed like four layers of

1139
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:45,079
net you know because it was just like

1140
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,160
flopping off the place ideally what what

1141
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,240
would be like in your kind of sci-fi

1142
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,799
mind right what would be the ideal way

1143
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:54,199
to grow grow a medicinal plant it would

1144
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,240
be you plant a seed in a little jar and

1145
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,239
in this just huge big bud appears right

1146
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,239
there's no leaves there's no stem it's

1147
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,838
just like w and that's essentially what

1148
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,479
you know your mate there is is doing on

1149
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:07,358
on a certain scale it's like s not

1150
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,920
sacrificing but you're well yeah

1151
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,358
compensating you know stem um elongation

1152
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,039
and stuff like that for a more stocky

1153
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,159
and again the plant's got a potential of

1154
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,960
biomass as well people always forget

1155
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,000
that they break it down into the

1156
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,920
different components but like a metric

1157
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,679
in a lot of other crop plants is is just

1158
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,280
biomass what's the bio

1159
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,919
you'll get it in the in the seed um you

1160
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,800
know the listing tell you a biomass per

1161
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,079
area you know tons per area whatever it

1162
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,519
may be um that's not something we tend

1163
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,200
to talk as much about um a little bit in

1164
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,159
hemp the hemp world will do it um but we

1165
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,439
tend to talk about in medicinal plants

1166
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,759
we talk about dry weights and you know

1167
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,920
things like that so but the plant the

1168
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,040
point I'm trying to make is that it has

1169
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,079
a genetic potential that's actually

1170
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,239
often based on on biomass and not

1171
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,318
necessarily the specific tissues within

1172
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,519
that biomass um I've seen someone

1173
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:07,358
recently someone recently published a

1174
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,960
paper and they had because one of the

1175
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:13,159
the biggest um missing components of the

1176
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,280
the genetic side was we don't we don't

1177
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,759
have really good yield markers we don't

1178
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,000
have really good you know gene

1179
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,280
expression markers for high yield um but

1180
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,559
someone's recently just put some out so

1181
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,240
I've not looked into that yet but

1182
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,160
that'll be interesting to see how how

1183
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,719
those correlate because again

1184
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,318
I would imagine it be very variety

1185
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,239
specific just given the variety of

1186
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,039
different ways it can grow I would think

1187
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,519
it would be hard to find that Master

1188
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,358
regulator although again for all other

1189
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,280
crops we tend to know it you know we

1190
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:44,759
tend to know what's the biomass of that

1191
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,240
is this and there's a range there and

1192
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,280
you would be really disappointed if you

1193
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,078
didn't hit that range um yeah but we

1194
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,720
we're in the infancy with this plant in

1195
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:56,559
terms of you know understanding and

1196
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,919
because it's been it's been so cuz you

1197
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,559
had to do license for so long it's been

1198
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,240
so difficult to actually do a massive

1199
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,079
work and have it well documented and Inc

1200
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,799
comparable conditions and stuff like

1201
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,400
that you know so it's like the biggest

1202
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,200
citizen science project of all time in

1203
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,079
some senses you know we've all just went

1204
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,000
out and done our own thing for years and

1205
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,599
now we're kind of able to come together

1206
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,199
and share some of that which is pretty

1207
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,359
cool um but I know in the States you

1208
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,480
guys are fur way further ahead but I'm

1209
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,799
still I'm still reving in the novelty of

1210
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,240
having conversations like this you know

1211
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,920
and and and being able to kind of like

1212
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,639
you know talk about this openly and

1213
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,760
having different levels of availability

1214
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:38,519
in different places as well you know so

1215
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,119
like sometimes experience

1216
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,239
is always experience helps but sometimes

1217
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,119
it's less relevant to a certain

1218
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:46,879
background you know like I'm not going

1219
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,640
to go in and tell your mate how to how

1220
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,000
to cut his plants any better you know

1221
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:54,199
when he's super super scug into that

1222
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,480
croing to that extent so that's another

1223
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:59,519
thing about it is like any plant you're

1224
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,480
grown of any type just be humble and be

1225
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,199
respectful of what it's doing and you

1226
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,559
know don't try and don't try and

1227
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,759
overtake the process just let it do its

1228
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:09,200
thing just all you try and do is like in

1229
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,559
my mind it's like wrapping it in Cotton

1230
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,039
will you know you're just creating this

1231
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,880
environment a little bubble for it to

1232
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:19,039
thrive in um that that's all like actual

1233
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,760
interaction with the plant is you know

1234
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,440
sorry interference with the plant not

1235
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,200
interaction interference with the plant

1236
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,480
is is is the less the better in my my

1237
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,879
opinion you know you mentioned bio M and

1238
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,000
my next question kind of relates to that

1239
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,280
bud density is what I want to get into

1240
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,559
next another article you wrote you it

1241
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,400
was something very interesting really

1242
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,319
popped out at me you mentioned that

1243
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,760
light schedule can impact Bud density

1244
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,639
can you explain yeah there was um I

1245
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,559
think there's two papers now and

1246
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,598
Publications that show this but

1247
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,960
essentially like so so for many many

1248
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,680
years we just went under the the kind of

1249
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,599
the metric of 18 hours um of light

1250
00:45:54,679 --> 00:46:00,318
during veg 12 hours during flow right

1251
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,440
but I always like thought well why 12

1252
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,679
hours like it seems like if it's just 12

1253
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,480
hours that activates fling then that

1254
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:09,679
seems awful close to the line to pick 12

1255
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,039
hours right so actually it must be

1256
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,838
higher than that and for what I can

1257
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,318
gather if you averaged it out like when

1258
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:19,159
is the actual flowering time initiated

1259
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,960
if you averaged it out between you know

1260
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,480
a lot of the varieties that we had data

1261
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,119
for we found it was 13.5 hours right so

1262
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,838
so most of them would be triggered into

1263
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:31,519
flowering at and a half hours of light

1264
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:34,480
not 12 right so what these studies did

1265
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,639
was they we 10 they took some of the you

1266
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,838
know some of the plants that actually

1267
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,400
flowered under slightly longer days like

1268
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:44,078
14 14 and a half hours so they did like

1269
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,240
a a 14 um 10 schedule they did like a a

1270
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,400
1212 then they did a 1014 schedule in

1271
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,039
the opposite way and what they measured

1272
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,519
was like you know how that changed the

1273
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,800
morphology of the buds and essentially

1274
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,719
what happened

1275
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,640
was the shorter the

1276
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:03,799
daytime the smaller and fatter the buds

1277
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,000
were and the longer so but but it seemed

1278
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,079
like 122 was kind of The Sweet Spot

1279
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,480
believe it or not you know like again it

1280
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,640
would be variety specific but what they

1281
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,079
found was if you want to a good balance

1282
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,400
between elongation and and fattening

1283
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,599
then then you would You' probably hit

1284
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,240
122 what's interesting is a couple of

1285
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,240
buddies one of them shout out to Stuart

1286
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:27,000
Maxwell up in up in Vancouver he done a

1287
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:28,919
few interesting things and he would

1288
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,960
would he would augment the time so we'd

1289
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,760
use 1212 to initiate flowering then he'd

1290
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,960
push it up to 13 and 1 half hours of

1291
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,599
light for you know three or four weeks

1292
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,358
to give it that extra

1293
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,880
photosynthetic um you know activity then

1294
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,039
it would dial it back down to finish it

1295
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,760
um but what I've come to realize and one

1296
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,599
of my personal tips is is to dial it all

1297
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,119
the way down in the finishing weeks

1298
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,359
after you've had your Boost week um you

1299
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,599
know your big Bloom um onset when you

1300
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,519
you get most of your mask coming through

1301
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,599
after they can it so like in my in my

1302
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,679
head fling follows this pattern if it's

1303
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,680
10 if it's 10 we flowering for example

1304
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,318
you have five weeks of oh yeah look at

1305
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,118
this it's coming it's coming it's coming

1306
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,960
and you have two or three weeks of just

1307
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,400
boom batting and out like you're now

1308
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,199
it's starting to gain some weight and

1309
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,880
then that last few weeks doesn't look

1310
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,759
like much is happening but what's

1311
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,000
generally happening in my mind is is is

1312
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,000
getting density right so if I follow

1313
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,039
that pattern and apply it to what we

1314
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,920
were talking about about you know

1315
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,159
controlling the light to control the the

1316
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,280
shape of the bud then what I tend to do

1317
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,838
is in that after that boom phase that

1318
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,839
two or three weeks of Boom phase between

1319
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,519
5 and 8 I tend to dial it right down dog

1320
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,558
with 10 hours late and what you see is

1321
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,239
that finish um that that density there

1322
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:45,960
at the end where is normally it finishes

1323
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:47,558
on 1212 it just really comes through and

1324
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,599
that goes you know there's evidence

1325
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,400
there and the Publications to show that

1326
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,318
that happens under that but rather than

1327
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,480
do like a full cycle under one or the

1328
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:58,039
other you know why not change it

1329
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,079
throughout I actually like St I I really

1330
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:01,759
like to stagger the transition as well

1331
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,318
it's another little crop steering trick

1332
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,359
as well if you go from 18 hours of light

1333
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,880
straight into 12 hours of of like you

1334
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:10,960
tend to have a little bit of couple of

1335
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,680
days of the pl going who what's going on

1336
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,400
you know figure this out and right okay

1337
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:19,719
I'm away um if you if you if you can of

1338
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,000
graduate it down um I find that the

1339
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,838
plant tends to transition much smoother

1340
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,318
and we get where we want to be a little

1341
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:29,480
bit quicker um again

1342
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,599
is that a scientific claim not really

1343
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,240
it's it's just an observation thing and

1344
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,519
whenever I do that and you can be quite

1345
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,479
you can be quite extreme you can take

1346
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,280
two two hours off every other day you

1347
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,400
know but just do some kind of

1348
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,000
incremental decrease towards 12 I prefer

1349
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,119
to do it maybe over two weeks um and

1350
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,039
just like slowly you know an hour or so

1351
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,559
a day give or take some days you won't

1352
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,838
do it doesn't really need to if you've

1353
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,880
got a good programmable LED you can

1354
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:56,759
automate it to go from this to that over

1355
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,000
this amount of time which would be the

1356
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,680
ideal way doing it because it just

1357
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,440
mimics a natural thing because one of

1358
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:06,719
the big things that we learned from this

1359
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,400
plant is the the autoing phase is really

1360
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,598
of the Fall you guys call it right the

1361
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,760
fall phase of a plant's life is really

1362
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,318
important especially to the finish of

1363
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,359
this plant so in the fall we get less

1364
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:19,599
daytime as well as well as dropping

1365
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,239
temperature right but whenever we're

1366
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,559
talking about getting color or getting a

1367
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:25,039
nice finish we don't often talk about

1368
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,240
the light we only talk about dropping

1369
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,519
the temperature generally and given only

1370
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,159
water for example so starve the plant a

1371
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,079
little bit and you take away its

1372
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:34,719
temperature well why would you not go

1373
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,839
all the way and then reduce the light as

1374
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,239
well because you know that that has an

1375
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:41,599
effect on how it finishes um and my

1376
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,719
experience tells me that I wouldn't not

1377
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,240
do that let's put it that way that's

1378
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:47,558
really interesting I think I'm going to

1379
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,159
try adjusting the light schedule in the

1380
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,839
future to kind of what you had mentioned

1381
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,318
there gradual transition down it's

1382
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:56,920
something I haven't really personally

1383
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,440
experimented with much the only really

1384
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,000
experimentation I've done with life

1385
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:05,559
schedules is 11 hours on 13 hours off

1386
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,519
but some people doing 10 hours on 14

1387
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,359
hours off so I think I personally need

1388
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,199
to go through and do some more

1389
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,078
experimentation especially since you

1390
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,598
mentioned that there is a a potential

1391
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,440
impact on bud density when it comes to

1392
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:20,838
messing with the light schedule so

1393
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,760
that's pretty cool to hear yeah I mean

1394
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:25,679
the the plant isn't entirely locked in

1395
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,880
to that because we know that auto fling

1396
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:30,318
exists right which kind of like you know

1397
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,160
it does but again I find the same

1398
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,480
applies if you still reduce the the

1399
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:38,239
light time and give it a natural b um

1400
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,639
onset of fall then you you tend to get

1401
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,159
just got a better finish if you you get

1402
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,078
a little Flex of color coming out you

1403
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,639
know you drop the temperature reduce the

1404
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,000
nutrient you give the the light down and

1405
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:50,318
even even even the auto flowers tend to

1406
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,079
you know stiffen up a we bit in terms of

1407
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,599
they just feel a little bit more compact

1408
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,960
at the end um but but we know that

1409
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,400
that's we know that that path is being

1410
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,679
sueded in some respects just by the life

1411
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,440
cycle of the plant and an aut flower you

1412
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:08,519
know um so yeah tricky to try to figure

1413
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,119
all this out you know what about flower

1414
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,838
never considered

1415
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,318
that in this Theory but no it's it's

1416
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,159
something that um because my

1417
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:19,119
understanding the genetics is there's a

1418
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,440
an awful lot of overlap there's very

1419
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,680
rarely like one on one off switch you

1420
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,200
know there's often way many different

1421
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,719
stimuli will feed into a pathway so

1422
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,279
there's multiple points within that

1423
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,358
pathway that can be activated if you

1424
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,920
know what I mean depending on the

1425
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,558
stimuli so that's or the stimulus so

1426
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,639
that's how the um that that's how you

1427
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,640
know generally that's plants are they

1428
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,759
basically this big mass of feedback look

1429
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,039
they're really responsive actually they

1430
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,359
have to be because they're stuck in the

1431
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,159
ground right they can't run away from

1432
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,279
their problems so so they have to have a

1433
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,358
really good adaptive strategy for for

1434
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,440
survival you know and I think the plant

1435
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:56,639
that we're talking about is probably one

1436
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,519
of the craziest in terms of its ability

1437
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,759
to adapt um just just really far out

1438
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,960
there you know super adaptable yeah I

1439
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
mean if we can take something that's

1440
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,000
been grown I mean Lane races are a good

1441
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,280
example of that right grown in one

1442
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
environment for so long and then we take

1443
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,440
in transition and completely change up

1444
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,280
the environment conditions and it adapts

1445
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,400
you know it'll still adapt it'll still

1446
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,680
grow and you'll still get to harvest so

1447
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,599
super super adaptable let's get into the

1448
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,838
flower stage i' like to know what tips

1449
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,720
or advice do you have in regards to crap

1450
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,159
steering in the flower stage yeah so I

1451
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,719
kind of mentioned a bunch of them there

1452
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:34,798
about the kind of changing the lights

1453
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:38,279
and stuff like that the light schedul

1454
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:41,559
but back to the light um Quality itself

1455
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,119
again kind of Fairly standard now people

1456
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:46,319
know this but you know increasing the

1457
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,720
light sorry the red end of the spectrum

1458
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:52,599
doing flow is important I like make sure

1459
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:55,358
I have that 730 in there nanometers as

1460
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,519
well because like I say I like I like

1461
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,400
the mechanism to work as it was designed

1462
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,280
and not necessarily to you know be maybe

1463
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,960
hold them a plant back but again it's

1464
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,200
not always possible a lot of the jobs

1465
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,199
that I've had and the facilities have a

1466
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:10,078
light that you know is limited to that

1467
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:12,039
and that's what you're dealing with so

1468
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,599
but again if if I get to choose whatever

1469
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,400
I want to do then that's I make sure

1470
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,720
that the light's capably going up that

1471
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,119
far um although I was saying I was a

1472
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,558
little bit kind of like you know ease

1473
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,880
off with the feed and stuff like that um

1474
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,760
if you're going to do it Now's the Time

1475
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,599
to do it you know flowering um again not

1476
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,079
not too harsh too early but by week

1477
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,480
three you really want to be really

1478
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,839
ramping that up um if if you're a

1479
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,400
nutrient Sky you really want to be

1480
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,838
starting to push it by the time you get

1481
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:43,519
to week five really ramp it up now again

1482
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:46,239
if you wanted to steer a specific

1483
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,880
outcome over another then that's where I

1484
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,159
would I would maybe change what you're

1485
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,760
doing with the nutrients um I'll give

1486
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,719
you an example of that let's say your

1487
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,200
plant is is adapted

1488
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,798
to no let's go other way your plant

1489
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,318
produces a high level of medicinal

1490
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:04,639
compounds but it's not specic it's not

1491
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,279
particularly well adapted to cold

1492
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,759
environment right so but you know that

1493
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,240
the facility that's growing this is

1494
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,680
going to get pretty cold at the end of

1495
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,598
the season and you know what's one of

1496
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:16,399
the things you can do to to help with

1497
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:18,880
that I've found that the temperature

1498
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,519
correlation between what a plant

1499
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,200
optimally grows at is is very sorry it's

1500
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,880
the temperature a plant optimally grows

1501
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,679
at and what it can grow at is correlated

1502
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,519
with the feed schedule so again if if

1503
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,798
you're growing slightly colder you you

1504
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,358
ramp everything back right and and the

1505
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,679
opposite end of the scale is also true

1506
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:37,119
if you want to really you know if you're

1507
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,038
in a hotter environment you can actually

1508
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:43,400
push it a bit more um within within

1509
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:46,799
reason biochemistry and a plant operates

1510
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:49,119
optimally somewhere between 20 and 30

1511
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,119
degrees right so when whenever we're in

1512
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,798
the lab and we're doing like maybe

1513
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,798
taking a sample from a plant putting in

1514
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:59,280
a Cell keep a dish and keeping it alive

1515
00:55:55,798 --> 00:56:00,798
usually we target like 28 Dees for that

1516
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,519
um something like that so that gives you

1517
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:05,119
an idea where the pl sorry I'm talking

1518
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:07,000
about Celsius here and just just so your

1519
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,838
your audience knows because I know you

1520
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,798
you um you Americans like to use the

1521
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,838
fahrenheit skill I'm not very good at

1522
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:18,038
converting it but um I'm always talking

1523
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,440
in Celsius apologize um in a hotter

1524
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:21,160
environment they can take more nutrients

1525
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,960
is what I found but the problem is you

1526
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:25,159
need to kind of balance that with with

1527
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,880
more water as well which is well you

1528
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:29,000
just diluting your nutrient back to what

1529
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,680
it was but just giving it overall more

1530
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,960
you know like there's that balance some

1531
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,519
plants will take more nutrients out than

1532
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,599
others as you know like some some

1533
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:37,838
varieties especially but I would say

1534
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,519
like so you're trying to you're trying

1535
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,759
to get this PL to be more tolerant to

1536
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:45,038
the cold you dial back then you trains a

1537
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,440
little bit and you you allow the the

1538
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:51,000
growth rate to slow and you precondition

1539
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,559
it that way so so you're basically you

1540
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,440
high medicinal compound producing plant

1541
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:59,480
it's not particularly you know good in

1542
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,400
19 degrees celsus right per production

1543
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,280
so what you do is you you you you grow

1544
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,039
in normal conditions say 25 to 30

1545
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,160
degrees Celsius apologize to your

1546
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:10,400
viewers again for not using Fahrenheit

1547
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:13,078
but um you maybe you can put a little

1548
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,960
overd on this afterwards Chris correct

1549
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:18,200
that um what you want to do is is is

1550
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,679
grow it at the the temp the desired

1551
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:24,038
temperature at the um a reduce nutrient

1552
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:27,038
rate and then when you move it across

1553
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,079
for example to to a lower uh temperature

1554
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,599
you'll get away with you basically what

1555
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:32,318
happens is all the growth will slow down

1556
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,559
a little bit but the plant will be able

1557
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,599
to with withstand that and still finish

1558
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,960
to a decent level in that colder

1559
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:40,760
environment so that's a little one of

1560
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,880
those dials that again doesn't get spoke

1561
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,640
about that much but because everybody is

1562
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,039
again it's counterintuitive right it's

1563
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,038
like oh you want more out the plant you

1564
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,359
give it more nutrients it's not always

1565
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,200
the case sometimes you actually want to

1566
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,078
slow the plant down a little bit because

1567
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,199
if it goes too fast it can't respond to

1568
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,119
the stress and sometimes it has to sit

1569
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,279
in the stress okay right now I'm

1570
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,720
comfortable and now I can finish growing

1571
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,200
so you don't want to be doing that

1572
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,078
during production right you want you

1573
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:05,239
want to precondition that and obviously

1574
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,680
when I'm talking about taking plants and

1575
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:08,159
moving on them I'm talking about

1576
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:10,038
conditioning mothers and then taking

1577
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,078
clones from there you can obviously do

1578
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:15,280
it with with with vegetating clones as

1579
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,920
well um and you can do both but the

1580
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,880
basically preconditioning you can

1581
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,039
actually do it with seeds as well Chris

1582
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,798
you know like setting seed in certain

1583
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,119
conditions will give you certain traits

1584
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:28,719
and in that condition when the seeds

1585
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:31,559
Sprout so so it's all about just that

1586
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,598
you know I I guess the overarching theme

1587
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,880
that keeps coming around here is is just

1588
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,359
this idea of like pushing the plant's

1589
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,559
ability to adapt but giving it time to

1590
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:43,038
do it make sure it knows what's coming

1591
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,079
before it comes and then you'll have a m

1592
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,000
you'll have a much wider room for error

1593
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:48,599
for when you want to do this new thing

1594
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,838
like for example in the example I just

1595
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:54,559
gave dropping get getting it to grow

1596
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:58,440
well at 19 degrees CSUS um you know you

1597
00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,640
want to give as much Readiness for that

1598
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,760
as possible you I've seen so many people

1599
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,598
fail by taking clones that are grown

1600
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,119
indoor only in in Canada or outdoor in

1601
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,280
California you know and then they come

1602
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:12,960
into a glass house in in Europe and they

1603
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,400
wonder why it doesn't performed to the

1604
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,280
same degree well that clone has not been

1605
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,639
in any way conditioned maybe been

1606
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,599
hardened but that's not quite the same

1607
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,598
as as is you know what we're talking

1608
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,798
about here when we're actually steering

1609
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,400
the crop towards something um I guess

1610
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:31,000
it's kind of like just changing the

1611
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,680
traits changing the expression of those

1612
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,838
genes but always limited by what those

1613
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,519
genes can do at the same time you know

1614
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,880
