17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,119
have you tried the peanut butter breath

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,879
cultivar if so how did you like it yes i

19
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
did i actually really like peanut bread

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:57,039
breath so i actually got i was gifted

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,960
from thc titan from square one genetics

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
he actually started his line i don't

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
know if a lot of people know this but he

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
actually started his line with peanut

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
butter breath cut i believe it was a cut

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,079
he started with he ended up getting

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
making into an f2

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,920
and then he took that f2 and started his

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
line i believe i need to get him on the

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
podcast sometime and then go through his

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
story there but i got his f2s that he

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,359
created a peanut butter breath they were

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
awesome i ended up getting one that

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,200
changed color to purple this is on my

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
channel if you dig back you can see

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
beautiful plant real dense all the way

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,159
down to the bottom i love a cultivar

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,759
that there's that density down even the

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,920
lower part of the canopy right so you

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
might not do all the lollipopping that

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
you should have done but those lower

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
buds are still really dense not all

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,079
cultivars do that i know there's select

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,799
cultivars that do and then as far as the

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,959
smoke it was a very chill narcotic

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,200
effect which is dumpster something i

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,879
really like so i highly recommend peanut

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
butter breath i really do did enjoy that

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,599
cultivar what's your thought on using

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
molasses during flour do it yeah there's

51
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,640
nothing against it i mean feeding in the

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,040
microbes right my thoughts on using

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,879
molasses as far as frequency i

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
personally like to just use it only in

55
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,719
flour i've used it throughout the grill

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,439
used it you know every other week used

57
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,239
it once a month used it every week just

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,439
generally speaking like my own

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,719
observations it seems like if i start

60
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,639
the plant on molasses young

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,639
the plant looks great you know after the

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,639
feeding the plants praying up towards

63
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,318
the light beautiful clearly healthy

64
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,839
clearly happy but eventually that kind

65
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,280
of goes away i feel like if you use it

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
too early in veg

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,080
so that's why i personally like to use

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
it in

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
flower mostly even all the way up

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,159
through flush through that flush period

71
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
and all the way to harvest plants seemed

72
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,680
stuck in time was growing good then the

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,719
leaves got darker and the leaves grew

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,640
smaller than before what could it be

75
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
and it could be so many different things

76
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,279
i mean there's so many different

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
variables

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
on it right

79
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,518
uh nutrition

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
if you're using synthetic nutrients

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
what's uh one of the first things i ask

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,360
folks that are asking for for help is

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,280
what is the ph and ppm oftentimes folks

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
will do a runoff test so they run water

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
through the medium collect the runoff

86
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,400
water and then put their ph probe in

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,519
there or their tds tester to get a ppm

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
measurement

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,719
and then that that can tell you quite a

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,158
bit

91
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,598
you know sometimes it might be that the

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,679
ph is out of range and you're not

93
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,000
getting the proper nutrient uptake

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
that could be stunting it um you could

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,120
have over-watered there might not be a

96
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,000
you know lack of oxygen in the root zone

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
that could stunt growth not enough light

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
that could slow growth

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
so there are many different things that

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,599
it could potentially be

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
if i had more information on kind of

102
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,719
what you're using for

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,480
you know nutrients lighting like

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,680
distance ph ppm runoff measurements i

105
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,000
might be able to give you a better

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,400
answer there first autos when would you

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
say top dress in happy frog with worm

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
casting russells on top i don't know

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
what your use i'm gonna assume you're

110
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,199
using some type of blend at this point

111
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,479
worm castings rice hall

112
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,079
there's got to be something more than

113
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,079
just worm castings

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
i'm assuming at least there should be i

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
would recommend that there's there's

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
some type of blend

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
typically what they'll do is you know a

118
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,238
lot of folks will have their initial

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,879
blend of the medium with the nutrients

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,720
then about 30 days into the grow

121
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,000
depending on the plant size depending on

122
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,919
the size of the container so and so

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,839
forth there's a lot of variables but

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,839
generally speaking about day 30 or day

125
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,519
40 they'll top dress again some people

126
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,198
go as early as day 20.

127
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,839
top dress again

128
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,199
then flip to flower and then 30 days

129
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,758
into flower

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
they will do another top dressing

131
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
and then depending on if you've got uh

132
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,279
you know if you're growing an eight week

133
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,159
nine week ten week cultivar or one of

134
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,359
the cultivars that are longer than that

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
you might want to do another top

136
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
dressing so pretty much generally

137
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,680
speaking every 30 days roughly some

138
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,000
people do every 20 days

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,439
some people do every 40 days depending

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,839
on what blend you're using so on and so

141
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,000
forth but roughly every 30 days is when

142
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,560
a top dressing should happen

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,918
what would be the lowest wattage to grow

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
you can get away with

145
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,959
less than that there's a hundred watts

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,720
is what a lot of people getting away

147
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,439
with a lot of these grow lights that are

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
for a two foot by two foot grow space

149
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,399
they're just putting 100 watts of led

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
over that and they're able to get away

151
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,918
with that i'm not really sure

152
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
what size growth space you're in if

153
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,918
you're in a larger grow space then more

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,038
watts are warranted there

155
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,959
roughly four to 500 watts of led in a

156
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,199
four by four space those are just some

157
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,918
rough numbers there how long before you

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
start feeding with fox farms so fox farm

159
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,839
trio i'm assuming you're talking about

160
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,240
there check out their feeding chart if

161
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,399
you started with an amended soil

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,319
typically you can get a roughly 20 30

163
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,000
sometimes 40 days out of that amended

164
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,199
soil depending on

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,639
what size grow pot it's in and then at

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,919
that point you would start feedings and

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
usually what i'll do is i'll check the

168
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,839
runoff measurement ppm some people go

169
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,199
after ec

170
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,198
they'll track that instead yeah check

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
out their feeding chart go by the road i

172
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,439
would say go buy the ratios because they

173
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,439
formulate their nutrients with a

174
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,759
particular balance in place

175
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,759
if you have an imbalance of nutrients in

176
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
your medium more

177
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
of one nutrient and not enough of

178
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
another it could

179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,399
cause a lockout to happen you can see

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,400
deficiencies

181
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,478
so it's very very common so yeah check

182
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,918
out the feeding chart around 30 40 days

183
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,599
that's probably probably when you'll do

184
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,159
your first feeding do you have an update

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,479
on the ac infinity pole fan how do you

186
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
like it they're still not available

187
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,639
no issues so far i'm running four of

188
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
them right now so i run two in each one

189
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,960
of my tents i have a two by four and a

190
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
four by four they're working fine i

191
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,799
think the main issue with those

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
oscillating fans that clip onto the grow

193
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
tents from other brands

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,800
is the fact that they had their wiring

195
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,439
run through the actual

196
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,038
with the case through the actual piece

197
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,279
that connects to the grow tent so as the

198
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,439
fan was oscillating the wire was just

199
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,279
rubbing up against the side and it was

200
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,560
shortening it out so that's why you hear

201
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,318
about people who

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,839
like their tents have gotten on fire and

203
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
stuff like that it's because of the

204
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,038
design now ac infinity their fans that

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
clip to the group tent those ones are

206
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,918
actually

207
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
the wires like off to the side so it

208
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,198
doesn't even go through the actual

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
casing or whatever so yeah it's still

210
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,439
working great i like it a lot and there

211
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,279
was somebody who actually was several

212
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,079
people who complained about the light on

213
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,159
the back that light actually turns off

214
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,399
so um that's just on temporarily and

215
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
then it ends up turning off after like

216
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,439
i don't know five or eight seconds or

217
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,359
something like that i think why do some

218
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,199
growers claim a fox fire motion force

219
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
burns seedlings i've never experienced

220
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,560
that have you i i mean i get minor burns

221
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,638
sometimes some cultivars but it's not

222
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
really detrimental to the grow i've had

223
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,038
one plant that i can remember that was

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
detrimental to where it just looked like

225
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,000
nitrogen toxicity and the leaves were

226
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,680
just terrible i think i have it on my

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
channel my main channel somewhere if you

228
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,079
guys go back to the sour diesel

229
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,000
this had to have been

230
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,240
said to have been like three years ago

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,918
roughly that's really the only one

232
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
defino just couldn't take it i mean sour

233
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,519
diesel from my experience when i hear a

234
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,199
lot from a lot of people is that it's a

235
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,240
very sensitive phenom when it comes to

236
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
feeding

237
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,960
so finicky

238
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
you're going to get some genetics just

239
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,519
like that but now i use fox farm motion

240
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
for soil i've been using it for

241
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,240
over 10 years

242
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,400
and

243
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,560
i like it what's your thoughts on way to

244
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,359
make edibles i usually do the oil or the

245
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,800
butter mostly oil done in a crock pot

246
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,439
kind of letting it soak in the crock pot

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
i don't have the the recipe memorized or

248
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,639
anything like that but

249
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,639
yeah i usually do oil and then use that

250
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,199
within the edibles i think in one of

251
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,918
your talks with dr bugbee you discuss

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,599
using green light during the later phase

253
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,120
of flowering

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
should increase

255
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,839
trichome production could you refresh my

256
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,599
memory on the specifics so it's not

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
green light green light is something

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,720
that's used but

259
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:57,600
you usually hear of uvb as the one that

260
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,759
increases trichomes now what dr bugbee

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,879
had said is that there are some studies

262
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,319
around it

263
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,919
but it was

264
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
i don't remember the exact word but

265
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,799
something like inconclusive

266
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,639
meaning that they couldn't say for sure

267
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,479
that it did increase trichomes now

268
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,838
somebody else had replied in the

269
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
comments and said that there's some

270
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
other study out there but he didn't post

271
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,799
a link so i'm not really sure if there

272
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,559
isn't actually another study or somebody

273
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,559
just just saying that have you grown

274
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,919
hydroponics if so what's your thoughts

275
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,759
not yet dwc not yet my concern and i

276
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,599
have a garden talk podcast episode with

277
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:34,399
somebody who does dwc and rdwc

278
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
my concern was that i live in too hard

279
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
of a climate

280
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,879
water temperature needs to be controlled

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
and needs to be under don't quote me on

282
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,360
this i think under like 75 degrees

283
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,159
fahrenheit and my natural just

284
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,759
regular temperature can be 75 to 80. so

285
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,199
i just have a feeling that i'm going to

286
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,958
struggle when it comes to water temp now

287
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
i know i can get a chiller

288
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,278
my concern is that's more energy than me

289
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
just being a small home grower it just

290
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,679
doesn't seem like it's worth it but i do

291
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
want to try in the wintertime one of

292
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,958
these times any good tips for welcome to

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,440
the grow temp pfg purple frost giant

294
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,078
it's somewhat of a heavy feeder in my

295
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
experience so don't be

296
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,078
too conservative when it comes to

297
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,159
nutrients particularly i'm talking about

298
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,399
precision feeding with bottled nutrients

299
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,559
i guess you could say right you might do

300
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
a little bit more than a half dose

301
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,439
generally speaking depending on the

302
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
nutrient line you're using so on and so

303
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
forth but

304
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,159
i've found that i've been able to give

305
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
more than just a half dose there have

306
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,000
been times where i gave a full dose

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,078
particularly in flowering so watch the

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
feeding and might be a hungry one i'm

309
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,559
not sure

310
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
what generation the pfg is but i assume

311
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,759
there's going to be some

312
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,719
variation in feedings depending on

313
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,559
phenotype as well the heavy feeder in my

314
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,680
opinion on the two that i had can we

315
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,759
hear the og 4x4 face it's uh that's fine

316
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,919
yeah every time i say four foot by four

317
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,519
foot people think i say it weird i don't

318
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,838
know i said it really sound weird it's

319
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,000
my accent so i'm originally from boston

320
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,320
and um i kind of have the accent a

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,519
little bit on some words it went away a

322
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,680
lot but four foot by four foot

323
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,480
i guess that sounds weird too to some of

324
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,159
you

325
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
can you give any advice on auto pots

326
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,639
do's and don'ts yes

327
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,278
so i haven't had the best luck with

328
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,360
doing organics in auto pots and there

329
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,120
are people out there that'll say oh i've

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,320
everything's been fine for me for me

331
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
personally

332
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
top dressing nutrients and using the

333
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,759
auto pots

334
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,240
didn't really work out well in my

335
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,759
expectations if using synthetics it'll

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
probably be a little bit easier for you

337
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,958
because the auto pots it's working it's

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,879
wicking up from the bottom right so

339
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,439
you're not doing any top watering so

340
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,278
keeping that top layer moist where the

341
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,959
amendments are for organics and

342
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,879
breakdown was difficult for me and

343
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,399
that's even having a mulch layer on top

344
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,639
of it even having a

345
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,399
a cover crop on top of it to try to help

346
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,559
with water retention and keep that top

347
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,120
layer moist so i wouldn't recommend

348
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,119
using auto pots organics with auto pots

349
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,078
but some people do so you may want to

350
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
try it synthetics should be good the

351
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,000
copper disk make sure you're using that

352
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
make sure it's inside the pot i think

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,278
some people actually got away with

354
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,240
putting it outside the pot like kind of

355
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,399
in the the bin below or whatever so that

356
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
make sure the roots don't grow out from

357
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,159
the bottom and clog up your auto pod

358
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,480
that's happened before to people been

359
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,958
using ro water but cost may become an

360
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,600
issue how can i remove the chlorine from

361
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,000
tap water that's a good question

362
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,040
aro i'm you must be going out and buying

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,120
ro yeah it does add up consider getting

364
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,799
a one friend of the sink that's what i

365
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
have i don't know if you have the space

366
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,159
for it or not but i have it under my

367
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,919
kitchen sink and i have the uh just

368
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,519
basically have one gallon containers

369
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,120
that i pump it into but some people will

370
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
do a five gallon bucket and then they're

371
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,799
just they'll put it into a five gallon

372
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,799
bucket but removing chlorine from tap

373
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,159
water as long as it's chlorine and not

374
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,159
chloramine

375
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,719
make sure it's chlorine first often

376
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,360
folks just let it sit out 24 hours 48

377
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,200
hours having sunlight on it will help

378
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
speed up that process for the chlorine

379
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
to dissipate but yeah a lot of people

380
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,278
just let let it sit out for 24 to 48

381
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,440
hours and then the chlorine is removed

382
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,879
from the tap water now i recommend that

383
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,160
you get a water report and have somebody

384
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,799
take a look at that to see if there's

385
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,159
any other issues so the soil doctor for

386
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,479
example is somebody who i recommend that

387
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,919
you take your water report to i think

388
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
going through logan labs you might want

389
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,319
to actually send a water sample to logan

390
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
labs have them test it get the result

391
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
then talk to the soil doctor and he can

392
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
give you some really good information

393
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
about if there's any sort of

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
contaminants in there that's going to

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
impact your plant

396
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,879
or he can actually

397
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
tell you what type of like what you'll

398
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,120
need in your nutrients as far as

399
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
elements because a lot of tap waters

400
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
have a lot of calcium in it

401
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
so if you're using a nutrient solution

402
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
you won't need as much calcium as one

403
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,239
example but yeah just let it sit out for

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,639
24-48 hours i think that's typically

405
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,440
what people do do you use silica

406
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,879
throughout the grill i do yeah it's safe

407
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
to use throughout the grow there's so

408
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,039
many benefits for celica

409
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,799
now short answer yep i use silica

410
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,480
throughout the grow does freak show have

411
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,319
a traditional skunky smell or something

412
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,159
different uh you know it's more of like

413
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
a at least the cultivar i have is more

414
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,838
of like a lemony type smell

415
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,759
it's funny i was uh

416
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,519
moving the

417
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,360
freak show from one tent to another and

418
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,039
i had it like all over my arms it was

419
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
flopping all over the place the buds are

420
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,278
just they're so heavy that they're

421
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
flopping all over the place

422
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,360
and uh i had it all over my arms and i'm

423
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
just like smelling myself and it's it's

424
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
definitely more of a lemony at least for

425
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,198
the finos that i have do you feed the

426
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
whole time with auto pots i assume

427
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,919
you're talking about with synthetic

428
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,159
nutrients it's really hard to give you

429
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,319
that answer each nutrient line is going

430
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,679
to be different me personally i've been

431
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
able to do like a

432
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,759
quarter dose of nutrients in the

433
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,919
reservoir and unfortunately each

434
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,720
cultivar seems to be different each

435
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,479
phenotype is different so you could get

436
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
different results as far as like the

437
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
health of the plant if you're feeding

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
nutrients from one reservoir going to

439
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,120
multiple phenotypes you could see

440
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
different there there have been times

441
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,600
where i've shut off the valve

442
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,159
let the plants kind of dry out sometimes

443
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,480
just add in water top feed water for one

444
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,719
or two times then turn that valve back

445
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
on for the autobots going on so that's

446
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,040
one thing you might want to consider if

447
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,599
you feel like

448
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,519
you you are potentially over fertilizing

449
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
so something to keep in mind can i

450
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,278
transplant from roots organic soil to

451
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,559
fox farm absolutely i don't know if

452
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,399
you're talking about like starting in a

453
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,319
one gallon container for example or solo

454
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,480
cup of roots organic and then going into

455
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,639
a new container that has fox farm in

456
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
there absolutely no problem what i hope

457
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
you're not talking about is like

458
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,278
starting in a one gallon container with

459
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,439
roots organic

460
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,278
taking that plant out shaking off all

461
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
the medium breaking up all the roots

462
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,639
getting rid of that medium then going at

463
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,040
a fox farm i don't think there's any

464
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,440
need to do that i've seen people go from

465
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,559
soil to cocoa that way

466
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,680
and the plant was not happy at all so i

467
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,359
wouldn't recommend that but you can

468
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,758
absolutely go from

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,759
roots organic to fox farmer vice versa

470
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,919
no problem did you completely move on

471
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,839
from earth dust nutrient line i wouldn't

472
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,759
say that i still have a bunch of earth

473
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
does nutrients i plan to use in my

474
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,440
outdoor garden i've just been really

475
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,758
liking the craft blend you know i only

476
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,519
have so many plants so

477
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,959
nothing against earth dust took

478
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,320
definitely took me a while to get used

479
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,919
to it and learn what that guy was doing

480
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,519
i wish there was more instruction back

481
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,360
when it first came out but once i got

482
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
the hang of it yeah things were things

483
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,759
were dialed in just got into coco does

484
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,320
the ph go up over time with cocoa unlike

485
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
soil that's a good question it's hard to

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,879
say

487
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,958
because it really depends on what else

488
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,879
is in the cocoa like for amendments for

489
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,479
example what are you using dolomite lime

490
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,639
is one of the things that that drifts it

491
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,320
up so if you have dolomite lime in there

492
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
it will definitely drift up and the

493
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,800
plant is going to release acids in order

494
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
to control the ph a little bit right so

495
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,519
if your ph is too high the plant will

496
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
actually release acids into the

497
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,600
rhizosphere you know lower the ph

498
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,198
particularly to grab some of the

499
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
elements that aren't available at that

500
00:16:53,198 --> 00:17:00,078
ph iron is a good example of that 6.5 ph

501
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,078
or lower is typically where iron can be

502
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,278
uptaken by the plant so if the peaches

503
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,359
higher than that

504
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,519
it's going to send out acids to lower it

505
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,399
so it's able to to grab that iron now

506
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,720
coco coir in particular is known for a

507
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,720
high cation exchange so talking about

508
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
cat iron exchange capacities basically

509
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,640
think of it like a buffer a lot of

510
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,078
people explain it as you've got your

511
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
piece of media

512
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
cocoa and you've got all these particles

513
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,519
that can stick to it and so cation

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
exchange capacity is just like the

515
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,599
capacity it has the ability it has to

516
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
stick to those particles you hear about

517
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,918
how cocoa a lot of people have to go

518
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
heavy on the calcium and magnesium right

519
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
it's because it has a high cocoa has a

520
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,440
high cation exchange capacity things are

521
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,359
going to stick to it that calcium

522
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,160
magnesium so that's why a lot of people

523
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,439
buffer cocoa with calmag prior to

524
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
planting in it

525
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,798
rinsing rinsing and buffering that helps

526
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,640
most of the time as far as does it go ph

527
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,000
go up over time

528
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
i found it does if you're checking the

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,679
runoff ph but i found it doesn't really

530
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:03,280
impact the plant i personally go for a

531
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,919
5.8 ph of the nutrient solution going in

532
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,399
and then i ignore runoff ph

533
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,080
for cocoa because yeah you know when i

534
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,280
first started planting it

535
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,399
what went in for ph is what measured it

536
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,440
came out

537
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,559
however over time what went in it i got

538
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
a

539
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,319
a number that was way up there and then

540
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,160
i read it online did my own research and

541
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,200
people say ignore it ignore it as long

542
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
as the plan's looking fine you're

543
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
putting that

544
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,000
5.8 ph going in

545
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,839
you're going to be fine so that's kind

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,839
of what i've stuck with over the years

547
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,909
