1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,318
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:07,679
if you can get those stomatas to open up

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,359
and to intake co2 it'll increase your

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,879
growth and your performance of your

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,798
plants like so much it got me nervous

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
wanting to venture into the organics but

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,800
as soon as i did and as soon as i found

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,719
out how simple it was it was like why

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,039
didn't i do this from the start

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,239
let's all add another layer of living

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,880
soil sea soil on top of the top dressing

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,118
so that that top inch is only the living

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,039
soil that's kind of drying out once i

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,039
see tap roots or some sort of root

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,119
formation i'll transplant them into

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,200
little half gallon square pots

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,839
it becomes super simple

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,399
when you want it to be simple just dive

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,520
into it get into the living soil and

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
just start

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,198

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,479
gardening you have a pretty easy

98
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,238
techniques you do a lot of easy

99
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,079
techniques when it comes to organics and

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
we're going to get into that today i

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
know there's a lot of people out there

102
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,518
that watch my channel tune into this

103
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,598
podcast that they are they grow with

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
synthetic bottle nutrients and they want

105
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,000
to make that transition over to organics

106
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,560
and i think kind of this conversation

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,840
here with you will kind of unravel

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
how easy organics can actually be so i'm

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,598
super excited for this one one thing

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
that we usually start out with is could

111
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,238
you just kind of tell us a little bit

112
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,759
about yourself and kind of how you got

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
into gardening

114
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,518
yeah for sure um

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
i've kind of always been into gardening

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,799
from a young age

117
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,798
my dad had a huge

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,239
vegetable garden out back of our

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,039
property and

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
um

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,919
he kind of just

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,198
made me get my hands dirty in it so uh

123
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,198
i started

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,439
started when i was probably four or five

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
doing that and then uh

126
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,120
as time grew i you know became a late

127
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,198
teens i i started

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,439
i started actually

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,360
going into hydroponics i grabbed

130
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,839
general hydroponics

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,720
grow bucket with some

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,279
general organics uh

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
bottle nutrients and master allies and

134
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,918
tomato plants and they were the

135
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,918
most delicious hydroponic tomatoes i've

136
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,599
ever tasted in my life

137
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,180
so it was kind of just intriguing with

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
with organics and and growing stuff and

139
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,560
[Music]

140
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,800
so yeah i kind of dabbled into the

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
medical market and

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
in the legacy side of things and

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
we uh

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
we had quite a few plants in uh

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,879
current culture hydroponics

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,759
and

147
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,439
so i did a few years of that and then i

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,439
moved i moved

149
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,839
a thousand kilometers away from from

150
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,759
where that was and uh

151
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,279
and then the legal market came alive in

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
canada here and i uh

153
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,038
i started

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,038
growing medical stuff and um

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
i actually

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,960
just started using synthetics like most

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,038
people you know uh

158
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,120
pro mix hp

159
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,399
just bottle nutrients

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,280
normal you know calm egg stuff like that

161
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,000
and uh and then i got into fox farm

162
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,918
ocean forest so it's you know mostly

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
organic mix and

164
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,399
um

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
i seen how

166
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,439
i see how easy it was

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,800
it seemed just you know add water and

168
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,038
the plants just grew and they grew like

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
beautiful beautiful plants

170
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,360
um

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,759
and i kind of did that whole synganic

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
side of things so i started off organic

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
and then i went

174
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,758
after the nutrients kind of drained out

175
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,680
of the soil i went back into the bottles

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
again and that's kind of when i started

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
to see my problems

178
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,359
you know the calmag issues and

179
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
ph uh

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,080
toxicities and stuff like that and

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
and i was just like man why am i doing

182
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,000
this to myself why can't i

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,439
why can't i just

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,519
add water the entire time like so

185
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,639
i kind of looked up a bunch of soil

186
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,639
mixtures um

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
my local

188
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,399
my local hydro store has uh

189
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,560
has guy green nutrients so i just

190
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,560
i threw a bunch of that in there and it

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,759
started messing around and now i'm like

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,120
full blown organics and it's it's just

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,360
amazingly simple it can be real easy for

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,478
sure once you kind of figure things out

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
you know it might take a little bit of

196
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,279
research to begin with and some people

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,279
might complain

198
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,318
that you're not able to kind of look at

199
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,679
a one-page thing and follow a chart a

200
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,598
feeding chart like you can with bottled

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,038
nutrients right once you figure out the

202
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,038
basics and you kind of have a general

203
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,560
understanding of things it really can be

204
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,759
as simple as just

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,439
watering

206
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
and top dressing you know what i mean

207
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,279
and we'll get into that a little bit

208
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,719
deeper here in a few so now you actually

209
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,119
have a youtube channel too so you're

210
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
actually showing off your garden to an

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,038
audience now i know you have i have your

212
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
youtube channel up right here 182

213
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,279
subscribers looks like you probably have

214
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,959
a couple dozen videos

215
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,279
yeah it's fairly new it's it's maybe

216
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,878
about six months old or so so it's

217
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,959
fairly new i'm just trying to get in to

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
get into it i'll definitely link it down

219
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,359
in the youtube description section below

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,680
so if you are on youtube you can easily

221
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
navigate to his channel and check it out

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
and then if you are on one of the

223
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,439
podcast platforms

224
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,520
search mad hatter organics and that'll

225
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,319
take you to his channel

226
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,439
so are you just an indoor grower or do

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,039
you do outdoor growing or what

228
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah um

229
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:25,199
i've dabbled into

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,199
outdoor growing but where i am it's

231
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,400
it's a very weird climate um

232
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
we have

233
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,278
a later i guess

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,479
yeah late spring so it goes into

235
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,080
about may 20th is the last frost um so

236
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
like you know i can't get my plants out

237
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
until may 20th and then first frost is

238
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
september 14th

239
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,599
so

240
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,560
i have a very short period i can really

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,560
only grow autoflowers

242
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,278
um

243
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,759
i have dabbled into photo periods but

244
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,759
they just take way too long they go far

245
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,639
into october and

246
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,240
uh

247
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,080
they just end up getting

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,639
you know the humidity spikes because the

249
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,000
temps drop so much um so i just end up

250
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:13,360
getting bad bud rods and

251
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,679
and this year we had horrible horrible

252
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
thrips um

253
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,399
and then we also have a bunch of hemp

254
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,120
farms around

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,679
that uh that just

256
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,039
the aphids the aphids are absolutely

257
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,639
insane

258
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,039
uh i've

259
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,720
i've done everything i can and i'm just

260
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,879
i've kind of given up on the

261
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,879
outdoor stuff but i do grow lots of

262
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,309
vegetables outdoor um

263
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,639
corn

264
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,639
[Music]

265
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,879
tomatoes

266
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,639
cucumbers peppers you know all the all

267
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,320
the general stuff

268
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,399
uh but i think next year i'll probably

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,959
be dabbling into a little bit more

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
vegetables so you're mostly indoors now

271
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,319
can you talk about what your current

272
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
indoor grow room setup kind of looks

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
like you know what size grow room are

274
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,199
you in lighting ventilation so on and so

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,300
forth

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,519
yeah uh so

277
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,879
[Music]

278
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,679
i have a little desktop vivosun tent

279
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,200
uh

280
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,879
it's got

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,680
it's actually for

282
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,958
propagation so seedlings and clones um

283
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,199
it has a little spider farmer sf 300

284
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,119
it's a little 35 watt unit perfect for

285
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
cloning and seedling for for myself at

286
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
least

287
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,279
i've got a little four inch fan in there

288
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
to circulate air

289
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,000
and then a little

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
a little nightstand or a humidifier so

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,278
it takes a little water bottle you pop

292
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
it on top and it just has this little

293
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,559
cool mist that comes out and it

294
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,759
keeps humidity perfect in there

295
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,799
so yeah i i run that for a few weeks and

296
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,120
then

297
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,199
i have it set up so it's perpetual

298
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,278
it goes into my 2x4

299
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:57,440
vivosun tent that i have a spider farmer

300
00:10:53,278 --> 00:11:00,320
sf4000 in that i've dimmed down to about

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,240
40 50 percent uh if i crank it up it

302
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
just the heat just becomes too much in

303
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,120
there

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,519
uh so i have a little

305
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,759
four inch fan exhaust fan that kicks out

306
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,879
of there i've got my vents open in there

307
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,120
i use that as my veg tent so the lights

308
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,838
are staying on from 18 to 6

309
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,860
18 and six um

310
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
i also use auto pots

311
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,039
[Music]

312
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
so once they're done in the seedlings i

313
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,958
transplant them into the auto pots i

314
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,439
start the veg off for about a month in

315
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,838
the auto pods and then

316
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,959
they get kicked over to my 5x5 that's

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
right behind me here um i've got an 8

318
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,278
bar

319
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:45,359
led

320
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:49,919
just an alibaba one um 650 watt

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:54,000
it produces some some light for sure uh

322
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,000
so i've got that set up with

323
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,479
a six inch exhaust fan

324
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,600
um

325
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
and then

326
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
another auto pots with the aqua five

327
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,078
valves so i just basically take them out

328
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,319
of the tube or two by four ten

329
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,120
the pots and i just transplant them over

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,760
into the the trays into the 5x5 so it's

331
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,759
super simple

332
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,039
i also have everything set up

333
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,000
on

334
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,919
ink bird controllers so i have

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,240
the seedling tent has inkberg

336
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:31,759
controllers and a heat mat the 2x4 has

337
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,399
both the humidifier or humidity and temp

338
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,439
controllers they're non-wi-fi

339
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,679
and then i have the 5x5

340
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,680
with the humidity and temp controller

341
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,679
they're both wi-fi so i can check them

342
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,439
on my phone to make sure that all my

343
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,120
temps and humidity are

344
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,700
are set perfect

345
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,278
and

346
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,800
[Music]

347
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,120
and yeah so they

348
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,078
my temp controller is set up on

349
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,399
with a exhaust van to pull out hot air

350
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,239
if it gets way too hot in there uh and

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,399
then it's

352
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,480
and i also have a little roll around oil

353
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,399
fed heater that

354
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,159
kicks on because i'm i'm in my basement

355
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,559
and i'm in southern alberta where it

356
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
gets minus 30 so it in my basement it

357
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,359
gets pretty cold

358
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
so i have my

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
heater there just in case the temps do

360
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,959
dip down too far

361
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,759
it'll kick on and heat up the tent

362
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,838
and then i have my dehumidifier set up

363
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,000
on my inkberg controller or humidity

364
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
humidity controller

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
so once the

366
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,560
humidity is

367
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,480
too high it kicks on the d-hum and

368
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,198
sucks all the video

369
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,199
and i also have the humidifier that's

370
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,039
you know if it gets too high or it gets

371
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,958
too low then it kicks on so you got

372
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,519
multiple tents for the different stages

373
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,198
of growth and one way you keep it easy

374
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,278
you just bench is you have automation

375
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,359
right so you're able to control the

376
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,120
environment's conditions

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,278
through automation the input controller

378
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,759
the heater so on and so forth so

379
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,480
definitely a way to keep it easy is to

380
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,958
invest in the equipment in order to

381
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
make it easy so your hands off quite a

382
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,518
bit there yeah absolutely in regards to

383
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,839
controlling the environment

384
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,759
now are you starting from seed or do you

385
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,320
usually do clone

386
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,879
uh it really depends on what i do um

387
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,760
obviously i start autoflowers from seed

388
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,838
if i do do autoflowers um i'm kind of

389
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,600
leaning away from it i did a few years

390
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,839
of it so i'm just

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
kind of interested in photo periods now

392
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
um

393
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,319
but i mostly start from seed with photo

394
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,559
periods and right now i'm doing a fetal

395
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,000
hunt uh 20 seed feed on

396
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,239
that uh that have started from seed and

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,879
i will be transplanting everything over

398
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
to the 2x4 soon um

399
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,838
finding the females calling off the

400
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,120
males

401
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,160
and uh and then i'll be taking clones

402
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,560
and cloning the planets out so i do a

403
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,519
little bit of both okay cool

404
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,958
now what are you a soil grower coco

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
what's in your mix

406
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,879
it's a kind of a little bit of

407
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,480
everything it's a super cocoa i like to

408
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,000
call it uh

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,360
it's a coco cocoa pearl

410
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,720
from psycho

411
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
psychonutrients i don't know if you're

412
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
familiar with them they're from

413
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,719
australia

414
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,639
but uh yeah some coca-cola with uh with

415
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,120
perlite in it

416
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,560
uh and then i add some either guy green

417
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,759
living soil or sea soil

418
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,198
and then

419
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,360
i'll add worm castings and guy green

420
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,439
dry amendments

421
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,680
so it's a little bit of a

422
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,600
super cocoa mix

423
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,958
what are you adding in can you give us a

424
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
little bit details about like kind of

425
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,559
your ratio and kind of what you're

426
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,560
adding in so what your initial mix kind

427
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,359
of consists of in detail

428
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,719
yeah um so it's my the auto pots are

429
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,759
3.9 gallons

430
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,519
so i'll add uh about two and a half

431
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,079
gallons of

432
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,198
coco coir uh half gallon of worm

433
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:02,239
castings

434
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,838
and then

435
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,120
a half gallon

436
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
of

437
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
the living soil or sea soil and then

438
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,240
i'll mix in the dry amendments on top of

439
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
all that

440
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
okay and then you're just following the

441
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
instructions for the dry amendments

442
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
according to what is gaia green what is

443
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,078
it you know whatever tablespoon per

444
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,919
gallon it mentions on the packaging

445
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,519
yeah i think uh

446
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,120
what did i have it set for i think it

447
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,759
was three tablespoons per gallon yeah

448
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,278
two it was i mixed in the four four four

449
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,800
and the two eight four the whole purpose

450
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,879
and the power bloom

451
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,359
got it so three tablespoons per gallon

452
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,879
for each of those yeah yeah cool all

453
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
right so that's their initial mix and

454
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,159
then you're starting out in smaller

455
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
containers as you mentioned coming from

456
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,120
ron let me make sure i'm visualizing

457
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,278
this right you're starting off in the

458
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
smaller containers in your ceiling tent

459
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,799
and then you're transplanting into

460
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,119
directly into that autopoc container

461
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,559
that three point whatever a four gallon

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
container will say for easy it's just

463
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,359
under four gallons i believe it is auto

464
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,119
pot xl i believe it is yeah when do you

465
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
actually do that transplanting

466
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,599
so yeah like

467
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,439
i start off my seedlings in rockwell

468
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,918
cubes and then

469
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,640
once i see taproots or some sort of root

470
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,880
formation um i'll transplant them into

471
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
little half gallon square pots

472
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
um

473
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,720
or solo cups uh and i'll just i'll i'll

474
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,719
basically just transplant those right

475
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
into like a living soil or sea salt just

476
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,558
so they're not getting too much

477
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,360
nutrients so they sort of so they're not

478
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,160
getting

479
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,759
burnt right away typically i'll leave

480
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
them in those solar cups or half gallons

481
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,599
for about two weeks and then i'll

482
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
transplant them into those pots

483
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,480
um into the auto pots four gallons

484
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,279
and i'll leave them in veg in the auto

485
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,679
pods for about four weeks

486
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,558
so then they'll deplete

487
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,640
kind of their veg nutrients out of that

488
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,798
mixture and then once i

489
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
throw them over into the 5x5 flower tent

490
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,798
so i'll veg

491
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,880
i'll start my seeds and veg for total

492
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,200
one and a half months

493
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
um and then i'll kick them over into the

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,400
flower tent and

495
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,279
as soon as i do that i'll top dress i'll

496
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,519
tea

497
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,918
and i'll mic you know add microbial

498
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,599
inoculants okay we'll get into more

499
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,520
detail on what nutrients you're feeding

500
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,879
when and the teas

501
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,519
a little bit later

502
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,880
first what is the water source using are

503
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,798
you using reverse osmosis distilled

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,480
tapped are you collecting rain water and

505
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,879
bringing that in so what do you do for

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,880
for water well for all my outdoor stuff

507
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
i i use rain water i've got a barrel

508
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,240
barrel collection system with that

509
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,120
um

510
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,200
i was starting to kind of think about

511
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,959
kind of introducing it into into the

512
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,480
tents as well but

513
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
uh

514
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,759
we'll see we'll see

515
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,798
um but i was also using ro uh i was

516
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,359
running to the store every week or so

517
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,319
collecting four big five

518
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,918
or i guess they're five gallon jugs of

519
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,519
water

520
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
you know they're costing me two bucks a

521
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,519
jug so it was just getting a little

522
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
costly and a little time consuming doing

523
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,359
that

524
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,160
so i actually bought um

525
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,199
one of those boogie filters i think the

526
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
they're like rv filters for for camping

527
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
trailers

528
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,960
you hook them up to your hose and they

529
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
get rid of contaminants that are in the

530
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,960
water out of your tap

531
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,320
they dechlorinate it they

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,400
get rid of a lot of the chloramine

533
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,720
they just reduce overall minerals in the

534
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
water so it's more of an acceptable

535
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
level like

536
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,599
like yourself i have kind of a hard

537
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,200
water situation here i'm running about

538
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,119
315 ppm

539
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
um

540
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,959
so i

541
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,038
kind of want to pull as much as i can

542
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,079
without spending five six hundred

543
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:55,279
dollars on the naro system for my house

544
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:58,480
so as of right now i've switched to just

545
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,558
using a filter on the end of a hose and

546
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
pulling all the minerals out of it yeah

547
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,000
it's a good thing to

548
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,359
remove the chlorine and chloramine in

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,359
particular because that's what's known

550
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,279
to kill off the microbes in the medium

551
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,558
right and that's what's the microbes you

552
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,240
want in a

553
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,759
organic system because that's they're

554
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,279
there working to break down those

555
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,960
amendments

556
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,000
and turn them into usable nutrients for

557
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
the plants

558
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
so it's good that you're you're

559
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,038
filtering that out there now you

560
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,240
mentioned the ro system being very

561
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,079
expensive i think you said about three

562
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
four hundred dollars i know you live in

563
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,158
a completely different area than than me

564
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,759
i have a five stage one that i have

565
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,200
underneath my sink

566
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,119
and that one ran me about 200 u.s so i

567
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
don't know i think canada probably about

568
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,599
three hundred years a little bit more

569
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:45,279
in there but i did the math on it and it

570
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,119
does turn out to be good for me i know

571
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,879
everybody's different number of plants

572
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,279
you're growing blah blah blah blah blah

573
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
but it can be worth the investment and

574
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,918
this is particularly talking about to

575
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
the people who

576
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,600
did what you did which was go to an ro

577
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
station

578
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,439
you know what i mean and spend that

579
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,440
money i mean my ro station that's right

580
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
down the street it's like a dollar 75

581
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
for five gallons so it can be very it

582
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,679
can add up very quickly especially if

583
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,759
you're not only putting that water into

584
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,080
your medium but if you're also filling

585
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,400
up humidifiers that's another thing to

586
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,000
kind of calculate as well so ro system

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
is something i definitely recommend but

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,079
i have you know use tap water

589
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,440
as long as you're filtering out that

590
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,519
chlorine chlorine the things that are

591
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,880
going to kill off the microbes which is

592
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,599
what you're doing right now so that's

593
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,039
good

594
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,918
yeah i was

595
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,919
i'm not against going ro whatsoever i i

596
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,320
love it i just

597
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,559
it's too time consuming too

598
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,558
costly for me right now so eventually i

599
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,839
will get one in the house

600
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,279
makes sense and then one last thing to

601
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,720
talk about ro i know some people are

602
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,119
going to call this out as

603
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,960
it's wasteful right so for every gallon

604
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,719
of ro what do you get

605
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,279
roughly three gallons is going to go at

606
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,798
the drain so recommendation and i got to

607
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,119
give a shout out to dog of the hut for

608
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,960
this one take your drain line put it

609
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,319
into a bucket and then use that for your

610
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,400
outdoor plants right so you're not

611
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,240
really wasting that it's not just going

612
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,759
right back into your local water

613
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,000
municipal system you know what i mean

614
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,960
it's if you're actually using that water

615
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,880
so just a tip there now are you ph

616
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,159
adjusting your water at all or is it

617
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
coming out within the range you want it

618
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,600
to be in

619
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,240
it's it's coming out a lit like a little

620
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:23,279
bit more than i'd like it's not too bad

621
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,720
uh but i also don't adjust it

622
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,599
um

623
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,519
i rely on the microbes to balance

624
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,399
balance that out for me

625
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,639
uh

626
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,280
i i trust it and

627
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,440
have trusted it so far uh it's been

628
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,839
working and i haven't seen any sort of

629
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,080
ph issues in my planet so is there a

630
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,000
specific ph range that you aim for or

631
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,000
you just like hands off as far as don't

632
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,839
even monitor it all just kind of water

633
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
it in and kind of let the microbes do

634
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,319
that thing

635
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
um

636
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,279
my tap comes out at 7.9 so it's it's not

637
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,319
horrible

638
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,678
uh i like to see it at seven

639
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,240
um and i'm sure the microbes will

640
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,240
will balance those out to seven

641
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,919
okay that makes sense

642
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,839
now talk to us about your watering

643
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,520
strategy i know you're using the auto

644
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,119
pod system you mentioned that i've used

645
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,519
the auto pod system in the past as well

646
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,319
we actually had a conversation offline

647
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,960
about using the auto pot system and

648
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,359
organics can you just talk to us about

649
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,279
the auto pod system kind of how it works

650
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,359
in your organic system yeah uh

651
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,720
the auto pawn system is an automated

652
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,000
watering system

653
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
it

654
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
doesn't require any electricity or any

655
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,679
sort of motors or anything to pump with

656
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
[Music]

657
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,000
it it works off of capillary action so

658
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,759
you have a reservoir a 15 gallon

659
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,079
reservoir that will

660
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,839
feed into the trays

661
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,839
the

662
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,798
trays or your your soil mixture will

663
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,959
then

664
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,278
soak it up from the bottom

665
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,079
and you know use that capillary action

666
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,000
to

667
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,199
water your water your plants water your

668
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
soil

669
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
when

670
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,480
when my nutrients kind of fade out of

671
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
the soil

672
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,880
i'll top dress

673
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,839
but when i do that i'll also

674
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,320
uh top water so i'll add

675
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,319
i'll add

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,840
a half a gallon or so water just so i

677
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,400
can i can get the nutrients kind of

678
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,199
soaking down into the soil instead of

679
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,440
getting pulled up from the bottom

680
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,840
uh

681
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,000
and then yeah i add teas i top dress the

682
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,959
teas as well um

683
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
i top dress microbes

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
every about every two weeks i'll shut

685
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,799
the system right off

686
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,278
i'll turn yeah i'll turn the system

687
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,000
right off and i'll i'll let the soil dry

688
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,798
out for a day or two and then that way i

689
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,880
can i can top water without having that

690
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,119
soil absolutely saturated

691
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,600
and drowning the roots out that's what i

692
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,959
was doing too you know auto pot system

693
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,959
like you mentioned it's hooked up to a

694
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
reservoir and it's coming down and it's

695
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
it's basically dumping out water or

696
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,120
nutrient mix whatever you have in the

697
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
res

698
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,639
to the bottom of the pot and then it's

699
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
like you said capillary action which

700
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
people that don't know that it's

701
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,640
basically just wicking up

702
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,678
the pot right but in my experience i

703
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,679
found that that top inch or so is still

704
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
still dries out so the problem that i

705
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
ran into in the past particularly with

706
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,278
top dressing organics

707
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,879
is it just it didn't maintain that

708
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,000
moisture level and the moisture level

709
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,600
needs to be there in order for the

710
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,038
microbes to be active and break down

711
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,359
those nutrients that are in that that

712
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,879
top layer so i struggled i had like

713
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,959
yellowing like

714
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
mid flowering week five or so you know

715
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,159
four or five for flowering on some

716
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,839
plants but i did the same exact method

717
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,480
that you did which is turn off that

718
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,119
valve and just let the thing dry out for

719
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,798
a couple days and then top water and i

720
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,839
also went in there like daily and i was

721
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,200
spraying

722
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,278
the top of the medium in order to keep

723
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
it moist like on a daily basis one

724
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:58,240
sometimes two times a day just that top

725
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,079
layer not soaking it so it goes all the

726
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,240
way down but just doing what i can to

727
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,839
try to keep that top layer moist

728
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,519
yeah because it is important when you

729
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,879
have an auto watering system there and

730
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,720
there are other so many different auto

731
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,640
watering systems out there some of them

732
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,798
are up top and kind of work their way

733
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
down which might be better arguably

734
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,038
better for organics i know i run the the

735
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,120
blue mat system that's one that drips

736
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,519
down from the top and i've had no issues

737
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,798
with that top layer drying out but yeah

738
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,158
something i thought that was definitely

739
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,079
good that you brought that up and talked

740
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,000
about the auto pot system and organics

741
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,918
because of the fact that it can be a

742
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
little tricky right it can be a little

743
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
tricky but

744
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,319
in the long run it is easier it is more

745
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,918
hands-off you know yeah cool yeah it

746
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,200
kind of like how you were doing it

747
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,640
spraying the top layer it kind of just

748
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
defeats the whole purpose of auto

749
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,799
watering it's you know like you want

750
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,200
that ease and and

751
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,440
reliability of it uh

752
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,880
but when you're having to talk top water

753
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,278
everything it's like

754
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,640
what's the point but uh kind of the way

755
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,400
i kind of got around that as well with

756
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,520
the top dressing

757
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,700
is i'll add another layer of living soil

758
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,839
sea soil

759
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,759
[Music]

760
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,959
some sort of of

761
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,759
media on top of the top dressing so that

762
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,440
that top inch is only the

763
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,679
the living soil that's kind of drying

764
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
out so you have that layer of top

765
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,880
dressing that will actually

766
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,798
be able to get

767
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,600
the water absorption

768
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,759
gotcha yeah i usually use a mulch layer

769
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,918
so barley straw is what i what i use

770
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,319
that helps keep that layer below the

771
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,240
straw below the mulch layer moist do you

772
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,720
use a mulch layer at all or just kind of

773
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,480
what you mentioned there i yeah i know i

774
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,120
don't it's just uh

775
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,599
yeah the living soil kind of layer uh i

776
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,398
recently just got in contact with a

777
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,558
brewing company to get some rice hauls

778
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,519
so i'll be i'll probably be adding that

779
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,480
in for

780
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,960
for more aeration and more silica um and

781
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,079
then that top mulch layer like you said

782
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,960
to try to

783
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,558
keep things a little moisture up top

784
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,038
cool how about cover crops do you do

785
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,798
anything for cover crops at all

786
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,960
i don't uh i don't reuse my soil in wall

787
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:11,200
i don't i do reuse my soil i don't reuse

788
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,120
them in my tents uh i i add them to the

789
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,200
gardens in my yard uh i will

790
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,079
add them to the compost i'll add them to

791
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,038
the

792
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,759
the the big garden bed for

793
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,038
more out of like autoflower plants

794
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,379
in the greenhouse

795
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,640
um

796
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,278
[Music]

797
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,159
but yeah i don't i don't use any

798
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,679
hey cover crop i i'm kind of looking at

799
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,480
getting into

800
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,360
if i can find someone with a two by two

801
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
um

802
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,319
fabric bed

803
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,559
i'd like to add it to my 2x4 and then

804
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,798
if i do end up going that route i will

805
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,720
start doing cover crops that way because

806
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,158
then that soil will just

807
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,880
be there and i won't have to replace it

808
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,159
how about beneficial like insects do you

809
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,960
have any like

810
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,640
spring trails road beetles isopods to

811
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,640
use worms in your garden anything like

812
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,080
that at all or

813
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,120
uh outdoor stuff i use worms um in the

814
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,798
beds and that for for the veggies

815
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,278
uh

816
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,960
in my tents i'll use beneficial uh

817
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,398
swerve skis and

818
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
californicus

819
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,038
um

820
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,558
just to protect for ipm measures for uh

821
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,480
spider mites and

822
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,440
thrips

823
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,759
but

824
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,399
no i i keep i try to keep everything as

825
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,359
clean as possible so i don't need

826
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,119
the rove beetles and whatnot to

827
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,240
for beneficials

828
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,599
and that's one thing i think a lot of

829
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
people get tripped up on you know

830
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,918
especially when they're starting to

831
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,679
learn organics they think it's a

832
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,038
requirement you know they think it's a

833
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
requirement to have cover crops they

834
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:44,960
think it's a requirement to have

835
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,879
emotionally they think it's a

836
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,360
requirement to have worms

837
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,679
beneficial insects when really it's not

838
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,278
you know there's there's that is one way

839
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,798
to go about it and you could argue that

840
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,720
that's the better way to go about it the

841
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,038
more natural way to go about it for

842
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,440
nutrient cycling and so on and so forth

843
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,079
but you can certainly get away with

844
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,679
using organic inputs without using any

845
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,519
of those beneficials mulch layer cover

846
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,120
crops all that stuff really you're just

847
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,720
relying on the microbes to break down

848
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,759
those amendments which is what you're

849
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,440
doing on this

850
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,798
on that avenue so

851
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
i think again i think a lot of people

852
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,519
get tripped up on that they think they

853
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,839
must do that in order to be considered a

854
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,200
living organic system or an organic

855
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,199
system whatever you want to call it but

856
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,720
you can get away without it for sure

857
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
that's uh that's one of the biggest

858
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,839
things that

859
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,120
when i was starting to get into organics

860
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,759
that really

861
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,199
kind of got me nervous about it was

862
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,960
was the

863
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
soul like this

864
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,038
so much information there's so many

865
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,719
different ways to go about it right i

866
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,079
mean yeah you know you can do the top

867
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,679
dressing way with the organic blends

868
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,278
that you're doing or you can do the

869
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,798
living soil and have individual

870
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,038
amendments that you put on once in a

871
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,839
while i mean rely on worms to create

872
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,919
worm castings rely on cover crops to do

873
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,599
nitrogen fixation so there's just

874
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,919
there's so many different ways to go

875
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,240
about it so yeah i think that's kind of

876
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,159
it got me nervous wanting to venture

877
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,839
into the organics but as soon as i did

878
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,200
and as soon as i found out how simple it

879
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,879
was

880
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,120
it was like why didn't i do this from

881
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
the start i hear you i was the same way

882
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,558
information overload and then finally i

883
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,720
found out about organic blends and then

884
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,119
kind of went that route so let's get

885
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,200
into organic blends in particular you

886
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,439
know the organic inputs the organic

887
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
nutrients that you're using curricular

888
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,159
firm are using gaia green

889
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,798
is that right yeah okay

890
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,679
you also use worm castings as well right

891
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,000
yeah

892
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,240
so when do you first apply i know you

893
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,480
you mentioned your initial amending of

894
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
that soil now eventually those nutrients

895
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,399
are going to be depleted

896
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,558
from the soil so at what point you have

897
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
applied that first top dressing and what

898
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,200
does it consist of so

899
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,839
yeah my first initial

900
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,640
amendment mix is when i go to transplant

901
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,959
them from sealing into the veg tent um

902
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,480
and then as soon as they're done in the

903
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,640
veg tent about week four so uh

904
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
week six from c but week four from

905
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,278
transplant

906
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,880
uh

907
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,359
i'll throw them over into the five by

908
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,640
five flower tent and

909
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,519
i will

910
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
top dress i'll mix up a mixture of of

911
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,558
living soil

912
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,640
um

913
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,000
guy green 444 and guy green 284

914
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,080
and also

915
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,159
add in some worm castings a couple uh

916
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,119
probably about two cups over castings

917
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,200
and then i will scratch the surface up

918
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,959
uh get those feeder roots kind of

919
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,240
exposed and

920
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,200
then i'll top dress all the dry

921
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,120
amendments on top of that and then

922
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,759
on top of that top dressing like i said

923
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,319
before i'll add a layer of living soil

924
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,200
just so that it has that dry layer kind

925
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,398
of thing

926
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,558
but yeah that's

927
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,439
that's as soon as i start as soon as i

928
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,038
flip them to 12 12 i top dress that's

929
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,120
traditional i feel like a lot of people

930
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,919
will do that they'll do it either on at

931
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,359
the flip or right before flipping that

932
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,038
light cycle you know so they have a

933
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,398
solid 30 40 days in veg and then they'll

934
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,319
kind of flip over some people even

935
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,479
longer than that but there's so many

936
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,398
different ways to go about it now

937
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,759
let me ask you this the gaia green that

938
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,879
you mentioned two eight four and four

939
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,720
four four

940
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,120
you're doing three tablespoons per

941
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,240
gallon for each of those is that correct

942
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,239
yeah yeah okay all right and then

943
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,839
do you apply a second top dressing at

944
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,599
all throughout the grill and then what

945
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,079
does that consist of if you do

946
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,759
yeah i will do the exact same

947
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,319
mixture uh

948
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,879
about four weeks into flour uh top

949
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,240
dressing that as well okay and then are

950
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,039
there any other feedings that you do

951
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,919
after that or is that it so

952
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,000
between the top dressing so i'll go

953
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
as soon as i put the flower top dress

954
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,159
two weeks after that

955
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,080
i will add a tea a

956
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,120
brewed compost tea

957
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,519
and then

958
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,359
about a week after that i'll

959
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,599
i'll introduce more microbes so i use

960
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,599
this product called microbial mass yeah

961
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,038
it has the microbes for that focus on

962
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,599
phosphorus breakdown similar to like a

963
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,278
mammoth p is another microbial inoculant

964
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,558
that's well known for to have the

965
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,838
microbes in there that focus on

966
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,878
phosphorus breakdown it increases the

967
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,398
bioavailability of phosphorus that's

968
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,279
that's what i'm looking for

969
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:19,759
so then yeah so i'll add

970
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,240
microbial mass and i'll also add uh

971
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,839
um it's uh it's another product from

972
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,199
microbial mass

973
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,000
where

974
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,598
it's derived from crustaceans like crab

975
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,599
shells and stuff so i'll add both

976
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,480
microbial mass and ketosol at the same

977
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,800
time

978
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,039
um and then

979
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,760
that's at week three and then week four

980
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,719
all top dressed again and then

981
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,480
i'll repeat that process until

982
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,878
pretty much

983
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,878
the fly you know the end of flower so

984
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,239
usually typically it's about eight to

985
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,199
nine weeks and

986
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,239
you know

987
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,678
i'll let the all that the flowers

988
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,159
deplete the soil

989
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,240
after that eight eighth week there so

990
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,759
the microbes that you're using

991
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,439
when do you start them and when do you

992
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,240
stop them are you also just doing the

993
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,320
dosage on the bottle for that so i'll

994
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:12,319
actually add them right from seedling uh

995
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,800
as soon as i

996
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,160
yeah as soon as i i drop seeds in the

997
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,119
into the rockwell cubes all

998
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,118
at a couple drops of microbial mass just

999
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,240
not not too powerful

1000
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,200
but uh

1001
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,159
it's increased a little bit of uh

1002
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,598
success rate on on the seats and clones

1003
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,679
um

1004
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,920
so yeah i'll run that all through it's

1005
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,480
every pretty much every two to three

1006
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,320
weeks i'll run that uh with

1007
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,280
with adding them into the auto pots i

1008
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
will

1009
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,960
i will double the amount that i that's

1010
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,960
on the bottle just because

1011
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,960
i i top dress in

1012
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,920
so i'll top dress in sorry i'll top

1013
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,960
water in a liter water with the solution

1014
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,680
and then

1015
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,440
i'll double the amount and add in

1016
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,769
the water from the below

1017
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,880
um

1018
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:03,920
[Music]

1019
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,960
so it kind of balances each other out

1020
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,599
so it's

1021
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,280
back to that bottle recommendation okay

1022
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,599
that makes sense and then do you

1023
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,960
incorporate any sugars into your garden

1024
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
i think one of the ones that i believe

1025
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,920
i've seen you use in one of your

1026
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,519
channels before is liquid weight by

1027
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,200
green planet nutrients

1028
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,960
yeah yeah um

1029
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,559
yeah so i'll add that in

1030
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,559
when i'm doing my compost teas

1031
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,160
just to actually feed the microbes i

1032
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,639
don't

1033
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,719
like to give them too much sugar

1034
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,639
um i'd like

1035
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,639
them to get the plant or to get the

1036
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,719
sugars that are derived from the plants

1037
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,719
um

1038
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,319
so yeah i do add a little bit of that

1039
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:46,799
liquid weight it's it's a three

1040
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,640
three part sugar solution so it's mostly

1041
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,760
molasses really

1042
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,838
uh

1043
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,839
and i'll add that in with my compost

1044
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,519
teas as well just to feed the microbes

1045
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,358
from the compost let's get deeper into

1046
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,119
the compost teas because i know you said

1047
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,279
you use throughout the grow or at least

1048
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,960
in flowering can you talk to us about

1049
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,960
the compotes you do

1050
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,800
they're just the aerated compost teas

1051
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,599
can you kind of tell us like how much

1052
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,320
compost you use to how much water and

1053
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,880
what else you're adding in

1054
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
yeah uh so i have these little little

1055
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,960
mesh bags

1056
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,838
they're for produce from the

1057
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,480
grocery stores

1058
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,400
uh

1059
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,400
they

1060
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,079
they just have little tiny holes in them

1061
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
just enough so that

1062
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,200
the the compost and everything doesn't

1063
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,530
fall out of them

1064
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,879
um

1065
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,079
[Music]

1066
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,200
but i'll take a five gallon bucket i'll

1067
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,480
add i compost i have my own compost bin

1068
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,399
so i i

1069
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,079
add worms to my compost bin as well so

1070
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,000
it helps break down everything in there

1071
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,720
um

1072
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,800
it's just mainly food scraps from

1073
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,959
from dinners and

1074
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
you know whatever's left over in the in

1075
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,358
the

1076
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,078
vegetable bins in the bottom of the

1077
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:01,119
fridge i will add about two cups of that

1078
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,680
compost to those bags and then i'll also

1079
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,400
add a cup of worm castings

1080
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,759
and

1081
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,639
a couple teaspoons or tablespoons of of

1082
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,480
the

1083
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,719
guy green power bloom

1084
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,639
i'm not really 100 sure if the power

1085
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,838
bloom's really doing much if i'm brewing

1086
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,759
that as well

1087
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,358
but i just do it just

1088
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,560
just because

1089
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,598
uh

1090
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,358
so yeah brew i'll brew those with

1091
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,480
with an oxygen or a

1092
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:31,679
air pump for about 24 to 48 hours just

1093
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,599
kind of typically what everyone does

1094
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,838
and then yeah i shut off the auto pod

1095
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,838
systems for two days and let everything

1096
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:41,199
dry out and then i'll

1097
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,519
all top water all my compost season and

1098
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,559
was that for a five gallon container

1099
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,519
five gallon home depot bucket okay

1100
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,599
and then

1101
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,719
you're doing that how often once a week

1102
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,720
or once every other week or what uh

1103
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,118
once every two weeks two and a half

1104
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,959
weeks and if i feel like i'm kind of

1105
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,079
over watering them with the compost teas

1106
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,760
i'll um i'll just take them upstairs and

1107
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,839
give them to the house fonts instead

1108
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,280
good point gotta put it put it to good

1109
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,960
use i mean you could even sprinkle out

1110
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,880
in your backyard right your vegetables

1111
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,679
i'm sure they'd love it as well oh yeah

1112
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,680
yeah

1113
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,838
yeah i brew all my approved compost teas

1114
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,039
for my lawn and for my vegetables out

1115
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,119
back and

1116
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,480
yeah put it put it to good use

1117
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,000
one thing i forgot to ask about was

1118
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,519
temperature and humidity i don't think

1119
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,358
we covered that what do you typically

1120
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,838
aim for for temperature in your

1121
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,960
environment so for seedlings i like to

1122
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,480
keep it around 78

1123
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,639
um

1124
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,358
fahrenheit uh and then

1125
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,279
65 to 70

1126
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,519
relative humidity

1127
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,360
uh just to try to i

1128
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,838
i'm a big believer in vpd um

1129
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,599
[Music]

1130
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:52,400
the vapor pressure deficit it's just

1131
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,880
it's proven it's it's a massive benefit

1132
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,880
to your garden uh

1133
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,440
if you can get those stomatas to open up

1134
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,400
and to intake co2

1135
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,159
it's

1136
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,920
it'll increase your

1137
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,039
your growth and your performance and

1138
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,720
your plants like so much so it's it's a

1139
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:13,119
it's a huge thing so i try to

1140
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,838
get everything in that perfect range the

1141
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,440
perfect vpd range and uh there's a few

1142
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,400
charts that are online that you that i

1143
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,119
follow

1144
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,680
um to to get them in there to for the

1145
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,760
right humidity and temperature at the

1146
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,799
same time

1147
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
so then

1148
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,839
seedlings will stay at 65 to 70.

1149
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
once i go over into the veg tent i will

1150
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,838
stay around

1151
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,960
78 to 80

1152
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,400
fahrenheit um

1153
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,679
and i'll

1154
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,440
typically sit around 60 to 65 percent in

1155
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,358
veg for a few weeks

1156
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,200
once i hit flower tent

1157
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,199
i'll start off at uh

1158
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,598
that's

1159
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,160
60 humidity and i'll drop to about 52

1160
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,800
into in 52

1161
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:04,239
until the flowers are done

1162
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,839
uh temps right now

1163
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:10,000
they're a little high they're sitting at

1164
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:13,759
85 not too bad but uh

1165
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,199
i typically like that 80 80 degree mark

1166
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,359
uh

1167
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,000
it's kind of fall right now so it's not

1168
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,400
too hot it's not too cold so my house my

1169
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,880
my central air my house isn't gone

1170
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,079
and it's not cooling everything down and

1171
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,000
uh

1172
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,640
getting to that point and i don't want

1173
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,920
to add my my little roll around ac unit

1174
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,358
because it's just

1175
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,680
it's more power more noise it's

1176
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,440
it's it's too much so

1177
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,598
i'll let her ride for now i'm almost

1178
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,119
finished flowering so

1179
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,280
uh

1180
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,200
and then yeah it'll be winter time so

1181
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,960
the the basement will

1182
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,159
cool everything down for me that way

1183
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,119
nice nice

1184
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,440
let's flip it up let's talk about ipm

1185
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,280
so do you do anything at all in order to

1186
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,760
prevent pests from invading your garden

1187
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
yeah like i said before i use a little

1188
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,520
sachets that i hang off of my plants

1189
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,358
by culper

1190
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,199
culprit i'm not sure how you pronounce

1191
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,000
it but uh

1192
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,358
covert biological systems

1193
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,960
uh

1194
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,920
they hang off your plants and they

1195
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,519
introduce swift skis and

1196
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,200
californicus to fight off thrips and

1197
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,838
spider mites

1198
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:32,559
so i got hit by spider mites if

1199
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:34,239
probably a year ago really sucked

1200
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,480
they came

1201
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,598
what week four of flower week three of

1202
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,039
flower

1203
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,359
there was nothing i could do i couldn't

1204
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,639
spray anymore i couldn't really

1205
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,799
couldn't really do anything other than

1206
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:49,118
introduces the

1207
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,519
sachets so they helped a lot uh

1208
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,200
they got everything under control

1209
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,880
manageable

1210
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,838
where they weren't you know completely

1211
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,838
webbing up all my butts but

1212
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,639
uh

1213
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,400
but right from seedlings i i use

1214
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,239
essential oil sprays

1215
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
uh there's a company called

1216
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,399
um

1217
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,560
culture

1218
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,119
and they they have a bottle of it's

1219
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,519
called mercenary and it's just essential

1220
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,039
oils so there's peppermint and sesame

1221
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,159
seed oil and

1222
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:22,880
rosemary so all the all the beneficial

1223
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,719
oils that we'll use as suffocants and

1224
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,680
deterrence for

1225
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,639
for the bugs i start that right from

1226
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,318
pretty much

1227
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,639
as soon as they start showing their true

1228
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,639
leaves

1229
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,480
all the way up until about

1230
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,000
a week to a flower so so as soon as they

1231
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,119
start getting those little pom-pom hairs

1232
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,480
on them that's

1233
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,400
what i cut them out

1234
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,838
and then i keep everything i try to keep

1235
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
everything as clean as possible as soon

1236
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,318
as i'm done with the tent everything

1237
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,679
gets

1238
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,119
bleach spray i sewed everything like

1239
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,440
i tried to keep

1240
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,200
clean clean and clean yeah that helps so

1241
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
much i always do a uh

1242
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,519
just kind of a wipe down of all the

1243
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,000
equipment grow tents everything before i

1244
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,759
start growing also i try to do one

1245
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,679
between when i flip the flower you know

1246
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,000
i mean i try to do another cleaning of

1247
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,399
that if i am able to remove the tents

1248
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,679
remove the plants out of the tent i will

1249
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,519
you know what i mean i think it's worth

1250
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,519
it in my opinion and of course one of

1251
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,440
the basic things to do is to avoid going

1252
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,719
directly from your outdoor garden to

1253
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,559
your indoor garden right because you

1254
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,959
could be little those little critters

1255
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,719
could be stuck on your clothing and

1256
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,000
could definitely invade your your indoor

1257
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:32,318
plants so yeah like i said this

1258
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,480
this year it was horrible thrips and

1259
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:37,199
horrible aphids so it was like

1260
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,760
i was freaking out for a bit i you know

1261
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,239
i didn't even want to go outside

1262
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,640
okay so what advice do you have for

1263
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,318
growers who are just getting started

1264
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,519
with organic gardening

1265
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,279
uh

1266
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,358
you know it's not as hard as you as you

1267
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,519
try to make it make it seem you know

1268
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,000
like it

1269
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,759
you read so much into it and you're just

1270
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,480
overwhelmed with the amount of

1271
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,480
information and the amount of like oh do

1272
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,719
i need worms and do i need this and do i

1273
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,920
need that well no you don't really you

1274
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,159
know just

1275
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,800
have a quick search on on build a soil

1276
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,799
build it you know fill the soil has

1277
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,000
amazing soil that

1278
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,720
that's already pre amendment amended and

1279
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,559
pre-built for you so it's like

1280
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,318
they have these little mixtures that you

1281
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,400
can do they have

1282
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,639
there's little

1283
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,519
there's little packets of

1284
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,118
of already pre-mixed uh

1285

brewed tea stuff

1286
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,280
so it's just you know it's it

1287
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,519
it becomes super simple

1288
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,830
when you want it to be simple

1289
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,880
um

[Music]

1291
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,720
just dive into it

1292
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,720
get into the living soil and just start

1293
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,760
you you don't need to go crazy on

1294
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
[Music]

1295
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,079
on rice halls and cover crops and this

1296
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,838
and that you can just

1297
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,839
start off simple um

00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,599
there's lots of of mixes that you can

1299
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,639
mix up yourself too like the coots mix

1300
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,519
and

1301
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,279
uh

1302
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,880

people going to be tuning into this epic

1362
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,199
it's not easy as i think it is you know

1363
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,040
what i mean if you're new you may be

1364
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,639
thinking that it's not that easy by

1365
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,480
listening to this but

1366
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,239
i think once you continue to push

1367
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,199
yourself to learn more and more about it

1368
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,879
you'll find out that the organic blends

1369
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,679
top dressing method

1370
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,920
is the more easier way to go about it

1371
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,000
you know when it comes to organics so

1372
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,039
