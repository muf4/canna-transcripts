driver to the grow light and this bag

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,739
there are four rope ratchet hangers and

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,658
an rj11 cord which is used to connect

55
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,599
and control multiple lights you can

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,759
actually connect up to 60 g8600 grow

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,318
lights at the same time very beneficial

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,439
for those of you in a commercial grow

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,839
operation driver hangers here's the

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,520
driver with the dimmer box attached it

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,039
also has a six and a half foot power

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,260
cord attached to it and lastly our two

63
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,120
frame pieces the girl at bars will

64
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,399
connect to them I place the two frame

65
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,200
pieces onto my coffee table and I'm

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,659
going to Simply clip both ends of the

67
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,939
LED bar to the fixture the first bar

68
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,400
slowly clicked into place since I wasn't

69
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,620
sure of how much force to use the

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,659
remaining Bars were much easier to put

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,640
in once I realized how much force to use

72
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,919
the wire on each bar then needs to be

73
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,259
connected to the frame so as you can see

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,878
I'm doing that here after all the wires

75
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,159
are connected to the frame we're ready

76
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,079
to attach the driver to the fixture I'm

77
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,780
using those plastic pieces that I showed

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,580
earlier sliding them onto the bottom no

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,919
screws needed those pieces will then

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,840
click onto the frame and the driver is

81
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,059
now secure since the driver is

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,920
detachable it can be placed outside of

83
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,959
the grow 10 instead this will result in

84
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,639
less heat being generated inside the

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,500
grow tent spider farmer said this will

86
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,479
also help provide a longer lifespan for

87
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,180
the grow light I like to use only one

88
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,219
row ratchet hanger on each side Loop it

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,680
over the grow tent top bar and then

90
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,419
latch each end onto the fixture the

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,580
dimmer box can be turned on full power

92
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,658
or you can adjust the dimmer anywhere

93
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,540
from 10 to 100 this unit pulls 860 Watts

94
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:34,219
from the wall at 100

95
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:37,439
PPE 2.8 micromoles per Joule ppf

96
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:39,658
2391 micromoles per second and the ppfd

97
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,340
map here shows the light spread across

98
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,378
the coverage area you can of course

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,500
maximize the light and increase plant

100
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:49,139
growth if you add CO2 spider farmer also

101
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,979
sent me their uvr 40 which is their UV

102
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,899
and IR bars it comes with mounting clips

103
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:58,199
its own driver and switch so you can

104
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,939
independently control the UV and IR

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
the frame

109
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,840
they were super easy to install they

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,120
latch onto the fixture and that's it

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,158
they list these benefits and have more
