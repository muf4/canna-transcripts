1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,569
what's up everybody feed that don't know

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,400
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it in

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,879
your watch I'm actress channel this is

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,830
the Mars hydro TS 3000 LED grow light

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,809
they sent me over the scroll light they

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,370
are sponsoring this video and in this

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,750
video I'm going to unbox the unit and

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,769
I'm also going to test the power output

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,759
using my apogee MQ 500 power meter this

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,589
mean your measures from three hundred

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
and eighty nine eighty meters to six

12
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,589
hundred ninety two nanometers

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,650
plus or minus five nanometers and

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:31,018
measurements are in ppfd okay first

15
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,988
thing out the box is this user manual it

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,399
lists off technical specifications

17
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:37,468
installation instructions and different

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,689
structions ten on the back side there's

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,420
some words of caution and it shows their

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,488
warranty policy it has to mean while

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,070
drivers these ones will be mounted to

22
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,669
the back claw fixture a five foot power

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,159
cord a wire hanging kit and Toubro

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,500
pratchet hangers and of course the

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,628
fixture itself I'm not going to go over

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,909
all of this grow lights features in this

27
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,198
video but I will leave a link to the

28
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,148
grow light in the description section

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,438
below so you can click on that link if

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,170
you want to learn more about this grow

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,298
light this LED grow light is dimmable in

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,070
order to dim the unit you flip the

33
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,439
driver upside down and remove the rubber

34
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,089
piece then stick a screwdriver in there

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,679
then you can adjust the dimmer that way

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,450
for this part test

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,090
I put the dimmer up to on two percent

38
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,290
full power the scroll I polls about six

39
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,430
hundred and twenty nine watts from the

40
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,240
wall and about five point two four amps

41
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,009
really this is just to give you a

42
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,688
general idea of what the power output is

43
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,310
it's not gonna be a hundred percent

44
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:33,839
accurate I'm taking the power

45
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,820
measurements in a four foot by four foot

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,280
grow tent and the reflective walls could

47
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,899
increase the part numbers alright let's

48
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,569
get into the measurements

49
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,569
