00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519

your life

48
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,560
i'll give you my elevator pitch perfect

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,399
uh i grew up in the midwest uh i was

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,840
diagnosed with

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,840
crohn's colitis when i was like um

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,280
probably 13 or 14 in that range

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,640
and i got busted for cannabis

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
in 1973 when i was 17 when i wasn't even

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,478
smoking yet

56
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,919
uh ironically enough a buddy of mine had

57
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,478
his stash and i was driving and went

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
through

59
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,239
an amber light at like two in the

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,879
morning and um where i lived it was

61
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,399
pretty

62
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,519
um it wasn't not a lot of light

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
pollution right

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
so the sheriff's car pulled out behind

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
me because i blew this light or he

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,959
thought

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
and my jim wooded friend crawled down

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
the window and threw in his entire stash

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,039
and this what big freezer bag

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
so of course the cop cars right behind

71
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,000
us and all they can see is what the car

72
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,318
what's coming out the windows in front

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,439
of them it's like a movie right

74
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,479
so it was over right there yeah so

75
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,519
they threw us in the county jail and um

76
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,000
ever since then i've been on a crusade

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,719
to smoke and decriminalize it i guess

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,719
at least in my own mind nice man and you

79
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
uh you you have a youtube channel

80
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,318
and how many subscribers do you have and

81
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,800
what type of videos do you do

82
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,639
we got about uh we have about 27 000

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
subscribers

84
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,318
um yeah it's it's we're pretty happy i

85
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,238
mean i really started doing it hard

86
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,719
about a year and a half ago i moved out

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
to seattle from new york city with my uh

88
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,479
my wife and one of my daughters

89
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:14,318
uh in december of 2015.

90
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,079
um and i i kind of made a vow that

91
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,958
year as a new year's resolution to like

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,719
do a video a day because all the gurus

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,719
say you gotta be consistent and so on

94
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,318
and so forth um

95
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,239
and then my health got really really

96
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,958
really really really really bad

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,599
um my crohn's disease came back with a

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,039
vengeance

99
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,719
and long really long story short

100
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,400
i had a colectomy which is where they

101
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,400
take out part of your colon

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,039
and they gave me a colostomy bag which

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,158
is basically you poop into a bag

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,239
um that was last may

105
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,639
and then they put me that's really

106
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,640
recent

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
and then they but thank god you know uh

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,640
i think

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:03,120
with the humera and a lot of herb

110
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,119
and very in its various forms

111
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,680
they reversed it so they closed me up in

112
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,798
december and

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
now i'm just i'm fatter you know i've

114

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,800
um algorithm thing where very few people

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
who do any kind of what even a

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,840
semi-controversial

130
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,439
get any kind of mainstream advertised

131
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,239
money so they don't let me monetize

132
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,279
about 90

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,478
of my videos so it's still

134

219
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080

220
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
smugglers there

00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:44,399
um on the coast uh

222
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,720
so i kind of got into it there and uh

223
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,399
it was more of a hobby i remember my

224
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
senior year

225
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,159
i graduated we moved into this big

226
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,680
apartment on marlboro street which is

227
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
like this really nice

228
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
tree-lined street in the back bay sort

229
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,079
of a brownstone but not really we had

230
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
these huge walk-in closets in this

231
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,000
this crib so i had like eight plants i

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
had the lights up there and i told my

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,399
roommate to water them what's

234
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
this mother essence uh they were grow

235
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,000
they were grow

236
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,199
you know sunlight tubes whatever they

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
call them back then and

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,000
the thing is they weren't even grounded

239
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
so if you touch them the wrong way

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,918
you've got

241
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:23,279
shots what year is this

242
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,878
this that was probably 78 i think

243
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,239
yeah 78 um so i told my roommate to

244
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
water the plants while i was going i

245
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
took the lsats and i went cross-country

246
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,240
with my girlfriend

247
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,278
the guy but watered them once and forgot

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
about him

249
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,200
so so yeah so then i went oh they all

250
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,158
died i'm assuming that's the end of that

251
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,519
story

252
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,360
i literally like toast yeah

253
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,879
but then i moved to new york city and i

254
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,839
was growing it was still it was really

255
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,039
bunk i mean

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,720
the you know i tried to find worm

257
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,319
castings i had heard a rumor that there

258
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
was a nursery out somewhere in brooklyn

259
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
that had them i couldn't even find the

260
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,159
damn place

261
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
this was in the early 80s um and i had

262
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,278
like a little apartment in the west

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
village and i grew some plants but you

264
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:09,278
know i used a lot of

265
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:12,240
miracle growth you know the connection

266
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,278
would spark up and it would spark up you

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
could see little

268
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,360
things at the end of the joint you know

269
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,480
right right

270
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,039
uh and then i i kind of pulled nasty

271
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,120
yeah very so then i kind of pulled back

272
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,199
uh because i got married and i had kids

273
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
it just wasn't practical

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
um and then we went to amsterdam my wife

275
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
and i and the kids a couple of times so

276
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,839
i was hanging out at the shops

277
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,599
now long story short ended up setting up

278
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
a growth thing in new york city for my

279
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
own medicine

280
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,278
then i got into it you know i i had like

281
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
a little uh

282
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,439
friend of mine called the sugar comb

283
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,479
hideout um

284
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,080
and right it was a small studio

285
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
apartment where i had like two grow

286
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,240
tents and i had a kitchen it was all

287
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,278
and it was all this old plumbing and

288
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,839
eating it was horrible it was really hot

289
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,320
um it wasn't practical at all we got

290
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
bugs um

291
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
i mean i was doing it with a buddy of

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
mine we used to have to get stripped

293
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,519
down to our undies

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
because it was so hot in there sometimes

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
in the apartment like

296
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,278
oh yeah just in the rooms well it was

297
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
like at a room it was two rooms like the

298
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,240
kitchen which was about

299
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,759
two by four and then the grow room yeah

300
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
exactly

301
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,120
the only place where there wasn't a

302
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,159
plant was the bathroom you know sleeping

303
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,919
under the lights

304
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,278
yeah well i wasn't really sleeping there

305
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,719
very often i was hanging out there

306
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,078
during the day sometimes but i wasn't

307
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,200
spending nights there

308
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:40,319
right but

309
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
uh so then i we something happened i had

310
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
a real

311
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,320
[ __ ] neighbor and i just you know i

312
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
also wanted to get rid of the apartment

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
and then someone got murdered on the

314
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,879
block and i was coming down from

315
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,319
the apartment one day one that like a

316
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,519
night that happened or something

317
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
and there were people talking to the

318
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,480
dorm and i knew these guys were cops

319
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
i mean just look you know there is clean

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,079
coast cops

321
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,760
they look like cops i mean not always

322
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,919
but in this situation they did and that

323
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,439
i took that as a time to get out

324
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,679
and it was funny because when that

325
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
happened i was actually transporting

326
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,879
plants from that location uptown

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
to harlem so i was sort of between runs

328
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,919
and i saw the cops hanging out i just

329
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
held back

330
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,958
so there was that kind of yeah it was

331
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,519
pretty weird how it all worked

332
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,639
but we found it yeah and we found this

333
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,759
awesome place up in

334
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,159
uptown that had uh perfect ventilation

335
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,200
it was on the top floor like 11th floor

336
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,799
apartment nothing around it it was like

337
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,320
sort of a tower

338
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,719
uh so get great cross ventilation um

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
and no real neighbors i just couldn't

340
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
imagine growing

341
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,199
in the city like in apartment buildings

342
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
and with elevators and stairs and

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
neighbors and

344
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,879
yeah that was more difficult yeah it was

345
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,919
kind of ballsy i mean you know

346
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,919
definitely ball

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,039
a little terrifying a lot of the time

348
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
you know

349
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,838
uh i remember i had a really bad fight

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
with my wife

351
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
and she was at my the place where i was

352
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,079
growing and

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,759
you know i don't know about how it is

354
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,039
here or where you guys are at but it's

355
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,519
certainly new york city domestic

356
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,599
violence

357
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
they take you to jail i don't even need

358
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
to see them

359
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
somebody tells the cops that you beat

360
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,440
them you laid hands on them

361
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,078
you're out right you're in rikers so i'm

362
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,760
sitting in this apartment with not a lot

363
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,120
but it was a lot uh certainly for a new

364
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,600
york studio apartment

365
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
and uh we were having a real set zoo and

366
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,240
uh

367
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
i was just just really lucky i mean i i

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,799
had a guardian angel i think or at least

369
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,639
did

370
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,319
i mean i've done i've been punished for

371
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,720
a lot of my life but

372
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
uh so far not no but no big issues with

373
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
reads

374
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
other things you have no issues with

375
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,480
leads right well that's good

376
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,638
is that where the name came from up town

377
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,839
grow lab you just have to start to be

378
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,639
chill you know as much as you can what'd

379
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
you say mr girl

380
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
is that where the name came from uptown

381
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:10,639
girl lab where yeah

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,560
that's really cool that is a cool name

383
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,680
and it kind of because you know we you

384
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,078
know we were talking before about

385
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,399
eclectic growing styles

386
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,319
i mean if we were i was doing organic

387
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,278
when i hooked up with tweezy and then we

388
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
went to

389
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,600
hydro or aeroponics and then deep water

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
culture

391
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
and then we brought it all back to

392
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
organic

393
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,599
and when i left the city when i left

394
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
that's what he was running and that's

395
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
what i was running

396
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
had been running out here for the last

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
18 months or so

398
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
why did you change so much like you just

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,360
want to experiment

400
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,959
or well i had this fantasy that i was

401
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
going to make a lot of money growing in

402
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,679
all these like

403
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:51,039
tubular grow systems you know um

404
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,679
like like arrow flows or yeah exactly

405
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,120
so we had like i think eight airflow

406
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,359
machines

407
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,039
going um and yeah we did get some yield

408
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
but we were kind of you know we weren't

409
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,399
really

410
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,679
smart we didn't we all we we kept

411
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,958
telling ourselves we got to grow just

412
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,919
one string

413
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,319
just one strain you know but we liked

414
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,198
the plant too much

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
so we grew a bunch of differences all

416
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:17,359
the time

417
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,519
so you didn't like if you would have

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,039
just stuck with one consistent like uh

419
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
high yielding strain you think you would

420
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,360
have

421
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
probably yeah we would have killed it

422
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,039
i'm sure

423
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,000
yeah are you like are you using

424
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,919
environmental

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,039
controllers can you can you tell me like

426
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,039
what's going on now like

427
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,679
okay so in the flower room i mean

428
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,759
in the let's start at the beginning

429
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,198
right in the bedroom perfect

430
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,039
so i just took about um

431
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,039
i'm gonna say 25 to 30 clones

432
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,719
uh for two different strains something

433
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,958
that we're calling ashley's

434
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,759
uptown kush because my friend ashley 420

435
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,159
positive smash 420 she found a seed in a

436
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,639
bag that she bought at a store

437
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,360
i think it's a blackberry a blackberry

438
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
kush or

439
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,759
uh some sort of berry kush um

440
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,359
so we mommed her out and took like a

441
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,559
bunch of clones off of her and then i

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
have something called northern monkey

443
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,879
which is a cross

444
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
of uptown girl lives monkey boy kush

445
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,198
which is

446
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:24,399
essentially a reserva parvata um

447
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:27,439
sour crossed with an og kush

448
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,120
if i'm not mistaken and that was crossed

449
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
with the northern lights number five

450
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,519
from bodhi seeds sort of totally by

451
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,278
happenstance

452
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,879
um so i got those i just put them

453
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,838
in dirt last week and i'm what we're

454
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,519
watering them

455
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,320
with kyle cushman's vegan matrix

456
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
is this um is this under t5 lights or

457
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
hps

458
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
clones are under well they're under a

459
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,078
cfl fluorescence cfl

460
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,719
okay gotcha yeah one cfl

461
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,239
um they're all in five by fives you know

462
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,480
we call them dylan's

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,839
the square pots they're like five and a

464
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
quarter by fabric

465
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
i know exactly what you're talking about

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,320
they're popular for flood tables

467
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,240
yeah exactly and they're like um

468
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
laying on a four by a three by three

469
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
card table

470
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,959
nice and do you you have like a big tray

471
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
or anything for a run

472
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,159
about four different trays guys those

473
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,320
eight of those pots fit in one tray so

474
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,120
i've got four trays in the in the tent

475
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
on the table so this is stage one your

476
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
humidity like do you have to do anything

477
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
to control that

478
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,360
or you know man i really no i don't

479
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,399
is it in like a is it a basement or

480
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
something or there's like cold

481
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,679
temperatures or

482
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,519
no it's in i have this little

483
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,958
outbuilding where i live it's an

484
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
unheated um uninsulated i'm pretty sure

485
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,159
because it gets cold in here in the

486
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,799
winter um

487
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,360
office space basically it's just a room

488
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,719
okay

489
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,240
about 175 square foot room so i've got a

490
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,278
three by three and a four by four foot

491
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,959
pro tip

492
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,120
really tense um so in the one cent where

493
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,078
i've got the clones i just put some

494
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,558
seeds in some

495
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,759
um they call them root riots i think

496
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,838
they're from uh

497
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,199
i don't know some grow company riots

498
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:11,678
i've heard of them they're like a little

499
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,919
uh

500
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,280
they're little uh peat moss yeah but

501
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,480
they're pre-cut and they're

502
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,119
already wet when you get them yep yeah

503
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,519
so i just put those ten femmes in there

504
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,918
uh

505
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,918
and those are underneath the card table

506
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
which also has another cfl hanging from

507
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
it so it's tiered

508
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
it's a duplicate okay um so that's in

509
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,079
the three by three

510
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,798
and i'm waiting for those to come up we

511
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,439
just put them in yesterday

512
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
and then the other tent i've got uh also

513
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
that's the bigger tent that's the four

514
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
by four

515
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,839
uh this is probably a bill collector i

516
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:51,359
used to be a bill collector

517
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,558
speaking of anyways so the so the other

518
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,759
ten the four by four

519
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:59,119
is um the top

520
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,119
half well they're all like either plants

521
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,558
that are from seeds are being flown

522
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:07,199
i've got a white russian mom that i got

523
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,119
from a seed from uh serious seeds in

524
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
amsterdam

525
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:16,159
it was a regular seed and i did a um

526
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,120
gender test on through bioscience

527
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,720
and i cloned her mom so i've got a room

528
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,399
of about 20 white russians that are

529
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,759
flowering out now

530
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,759
nice excuse me so i've got about

531
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,759
how many plants do i have there i've got

532
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,160
i've got ten plants they're they're in

533
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,200
three gallon containers

534
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,960
islamic now they're in veg

535
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,759
i'm you know sort of super cropping them

536
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,600
and tying them down keeping them short

537
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,798
got something called guide dog which is

538
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,918
from a guy named

539
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,038
nick tops in europe he's a holy smoke

540
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,360
seeds is his

541
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:54,480
um his company but this guide dog

542
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,918
the one that i did grow um was amazing

543
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
so i'm trying to see if i can replicate

544
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,720
that with one of his trains and i've

545
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
just got some chronic

546
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,919
just so that when i cut which is going

547
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,160
to be in about five weeks

548
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,880
i'll have something to slide in i'll put

549
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,880
them in like bigger pots

550
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
and they'll really kind of get much

551
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,600
bigger before i flip them

552
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,200
can i ask you about super cropping can

553
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,678
can you uh just give the listeners a

554
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
quick

555
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,720
overview as i mean as quick as you

556
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,199
really can i know it's a

557
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,558
they can get complicated but um that's

558
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,038
true i don't know how you do it

559
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,038
um super cropping to me is just

560
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:31,038
basically

561
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:34,798
uh you know squeezing this the top most

562
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:37,919
generally stem uh below the

563
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,720
like flower right and just squeezing it

564
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
to the point where

565
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,720
you almost hear a crack and if you let

566
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,759
go it'll just like droop over right

567
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,798
but it's not you haven't really um

568
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,000
serrated or cut the flesh of the plant

569
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:55,359
so i have the the eight to ten plants

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,759
here which are vegging it's possible i

571
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,439
may

572
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,240
bring them out of the uh

573
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
to the outdoors depending how nice the

574
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,480
next month or so looks like i got about

575
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319
10 outside already and

576
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,599
they're really loving it do you have do

577
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,839
you still do indoors in

578
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,158
indoor bloom too or no or i've got a

579
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,839
bike 125 square feet

580
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,240
uh you know in my garage nice

581
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,839
and are using like umbrellas or air

582
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
cooled hoods or

583
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,959
so i've got two dimmable thousand watt

584
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,038
lights

585
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,319
uh framing a 600 watt now the problem is

586
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,000
it's been really very warm out here

587
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,918
so i've just been running them all at

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,119
600. it's just too hot to run a

589
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,759
thousands because i don't have any air

590
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,038
conditioning in

591
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,038
there typically this yeah

592
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,480
the seattle climate is pretty forgiving

593
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,679
in the summer you know

594
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,279
um but it's been fairly sunny lately

595
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,200
so that kind of hots things up

596
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,639
so they're you're they're not air cooled

597
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
hoods on that

598
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,038
no i have an intake fan and

599
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,519
a exhaust fan so and i've got three

600
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,440
oscillating fans on the walls

601
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,720
so there's a lot of a lot of air

602
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
movement that probably helps you during

603
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,759
the winter time right you said it gets

604
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,839
uh cooler in the winter there

605
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,079
yeah i mean it doesn't get freezy

606
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,720
freezing but it definitely gets

607
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,079
it it can get cold enough in that room

608
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,079
where

609
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,918
i sometimes think about putting a space

610
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,918
heater in but then when i do i kind of

611
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,600
freak myself out about it

612
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,720
um it definitely can [ __ ]

613
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,639
it's one of those one of those

614
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,679
environmental challenges that i have out

615
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
here

616
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
for sure unless i'm going to spend a

617
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,000
fair amount of money to remedy it which

618
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,000
i'm not going to

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
i just have to live with do you use co2

620
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,519
uh you know i've started it i've got a

621
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,640
regulator which i think is stuck because

622
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,119
i just got a brand new co2 tank today

623
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,799
and if it's not they're not fitting

624
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,279
because the co2 is shooting out of the

625
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,720
tank

626
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,759
so you might uh did you make sure

627
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,960
there's a little rubber

628
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,480
i don't know if it's made out of rubber

629
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,600
actually it might be plastic it's a

630
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,640
gasket that goes between

631
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,038
it yeah something got blown across the

632
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,038
room

633
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,280
when i worked at the grow store we dealt

634
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
with people all the time bringing them

635
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,599
back saying that they didn't work and

636
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,440
then you just

637
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,079
you know see if they there's this little

638
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,720
gasket that comes in everything

639
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,359
an o-ring exactly and if it's not it's

640
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,079
between the the valve and the

641
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:30,639
the unit the plug-in unit the plug-in

642
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,359
the tank yeah okay i think it made total

643
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,880
sense to me

644
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,879
all right perfect just got to see it

645
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,038
so do you um do you have like a

646
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,919
environmental controller

647
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,960
for the co2 or you just use it i have it

648
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,799
on the timer

649
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
which i have to go and reset it's a

650
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,400
digital timer

651
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
so i'd like for the first 45 minutes

652
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
it's on when the lights go on then every

653
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
15 minutes every hour they're after like

654
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,240
eight hours i think perfect

655
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,519
said that i mean honestly my plants are

656
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
looking a little bit skinny this time

657
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,558
around but the

658
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
white russian i have to when i when i

659
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,399
say that

660
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,240
i don't know you tell me as a grower i

661
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
always think around you know four weeks

662
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
before harvest that my plants aren't

663
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,480
going to be heavy enough they're not

664
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,159
going to be fat enough and then they get

665
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
they start bulking up

666
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,520
oh yeah i mean they're still white

667
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,400
they're all white

668
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,759
there's no there's no discoloration yet

669
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,759
are you in dirt for these or

670
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,798
like what size pots are they in for me

671
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,519
what i've been doing

672
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,879
is uh there's a company called iron

673
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:34,240
organic and they make a uh it's a peat

674
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,320
basically an infused peat potting mix

675
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,480
i mean it's a just add water mix so

676
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,000
basically we did

677
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,079
most of the plants that are flowering

678
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,919
out now are in that

679
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,079
mix we've got a half a dozen that we're

680
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,200
running just with water

681
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,000
just to see right plain water and

682
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,558
whatever

683
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,919
nutrients they have in the dirt yep and

684
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,558
you know i've been i've been pruning

685
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,840
them like

686
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,319
everything else then the rest of the

687
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,839
room is being run mostly in that

688
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,439
uh mix although the big pots like the 10

689
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,839
gallons and even some of the sevens

690
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
which means about half a dozen plants

691
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,519
i'm sort of doing a no-till thing i

692
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,038
basically just pulled out the root ball

693
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,158
and dropped into clones and covered them

694
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,720
up with fresh soil

695
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,960
it's organic you just keep the same soil

696
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
keep letting it self compost

697
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,159
you know you're adding your top dressing

698
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,840
bokashi or whatever

699
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,640
um and you'll let it like hello you know

700
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,000
um like i got a friend in oregon who um

701
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
what do they do they grow in like these

702
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,839
200 gallon earth pots right

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,159
or cloth pots it's a legal grow

704
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,439
so when they cut they basically cut out

705
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,400
take out the center

706
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
mass you know where the root ball is and

707
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,519
then they'll they'll cover it with

708
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,480
whatever bone meal bokashi hay

709
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,519
you know dry amendments yeah and they'll

710
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,360
let us sit over

711
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,038
over the winter you know three to five

712
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,199
to six months

713
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,038
and then they'll drop in the new clones

714
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
and do some sort of top dress and take

715
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,240
it from there

716
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
cool yeah that's what i do for my

717
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
vegetable garden outside to be honest

718
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,439
yeah so i mean it's the same principle

719
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
it's the same principle it's just the

720
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,640
problem i think with a lot of growers

721
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
and that's it's marketing is that we are

722
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,038
sold

723
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,798
a lot of product that you really don't

724
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,278
necessarily need

725
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,879
for sure um even indoor growers don't

726
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,919
need all the bottles

727
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,080
um i mean i'm just curious about remo

728
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
i somebody one of my subscribers sent me

729
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,918
an email about them

730
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and he said you really have to watch it

731
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,278
because if you look like one milliliter

732
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,159
more per gallon you're going to get

733
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,480
burned

734
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,919
you know and i hate that well that's a

735
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,679
dangerous part about using multiple

736
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
bottle systems is if you mis

737
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,240
if you if you mess up one of the bottles

738
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
and there's six of them that goes into a

739
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,880
water mixture then you just

740
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,320
wrecked the whole mystery mixture i

741
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,440
think that's how you're gonna fix it

742
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,519
i think it's also more more um

743
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,960
it has more of a deleterious effect if

744
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,240
it's in hydro

745
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,798
soil there's a buffer there right

746
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
that's my feeling no i agree you're

747
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,759
gonna you're gonna catch a break with

748
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
soil if it's in hydro

749
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,359
like a deep water culture system water

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
them in the day and go away

751
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,558
and come back at night you could kill

752
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,039
everything for sure

753
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,240
everything up so your soil grower tried

754
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,480
and true

755
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,278
yeah i mean it's the real deal man you

756
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,319
know i got

757
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,960
earthworms uh there was a hydra store in

758
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,720
seattle

759
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,558
seattle uh was a sodo hydro

760
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
and apparently the law changed so he

761
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,839
wasn't getting a lot of business

762
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
for whatever reasons i can't remember

763
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,879
it's a 502 law

764
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,240
and uh so he basically went out of

765
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,760
business but he used to sell

766
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,240
these worm castings that had live worms

767
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,720
in them

768
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,159
they were the best yeah that's cool so

769
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,600
what i do there's a nursery down the

770
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,799
street from me and they sell

771
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,079
red wigglers you know in the 350 like

772
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,679
thing for 20 bucks

773
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,119
which is actually pretty comparable to

774
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,360
some online

775
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,038
from what i've seen so i'll just go

776
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,879
there and buy you know

777
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,400
20 bucks or 40 bucks and just put a

778
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
couple of worms on each plant

779
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,919
and let them do the thing how have i

780
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
never i've never heard of this that's

781
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,480
awesome

782
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,558
no it's if you're doing organic you have

783
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
to it's it's so much cool the plants

784
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,038
love that [ __ ]

785
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,558
do you do like a tease do you make

786
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,759
teaser um

787
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,599
i do i mean i used to do it more um

788
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,798
from scratch now you know i go to the

789
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:26,240
shows and people give me tea mixes

790
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,599
although i use booze malibu uh compost

791
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,640
tea

792
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,719
and also the one from extreme gardening

793
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
they've got a really good one now when

794
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,519
you're doing this type of growing is

795
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
there any like a balloon booster is

796
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,000
there

797
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,278
like an organic bloom booster like are

798
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,798
you even thinking about any of that

799
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,919
stuff or is it just like

800
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:47,440
dragonfly organics makes a blue

801
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,200
uh formula you know

802
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,558
i'm always suspicious of this i used to

803
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,720
have to be

804
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,398
i used it in hydro and we got these with

805
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,079
my my boy dj

806
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,278
dc and we got these like nubs like rocks

807
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,558
but you couldn't smoke them

808
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,519
they were unsmokable you couldn't they

809
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,119
wouldn't combust um

810
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,960
i think we were using some [ __ ] that was

811
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,839
probably outlawed in 14 countries i

812
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,200
don't know

813
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,359
yeah paclobe is the one that i've heard

814
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,080
of that's like a flower hardener that

815
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,359
is popular and can have that effect

816
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,759
that's probably it

817
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,558
um so i've been using i did a trade i

818
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:26,240
traded my book for some uh

819
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:29,119
fairly large bottles of mammoth p

820
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,839
so and you don't use very much of it you

821
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,439
see them

822
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,879
giving it away at a trade show grab a

823
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,759
couple bottles i give it away like two

824
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,278
ounce bottles

825
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,519
i've used it i don't really know if it

826
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,440
helps i'm not really convinced of its

827
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,519
efficacy but

828
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,440
you know i got it i'm going to use it

829
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,480
yeah i mean how you how do you prove it

830
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,399
i guess you just have to do a

831
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,519
side-by-side to really figure it out

832
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:48,879
and you know what i really don't have

833
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,839
much time for that i don't have the

834
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,440
space of the time to be doing like

835
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,199
i'll just use it if it works great

836
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,480
and if it does i mean it's not as long

837
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
as it doesn't hurt anything

838
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,599
exactly exactly and you know my plants

839
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,200
generally

840
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,319
are freaking healthy i mean i had some

841
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
spider mites at the beginning of the

842
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,200
year

843
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,839
which i should deal with those that's

844
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,519
that's a big thing so um

845
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,558
you know i sprayed like three different

846
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,879
types of

847
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:20,398
uh midicide or um prophylactic

848
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,960
like two or three different times in

849
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,959
rotation

850
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,038
multiple products then yeah i use dr

851
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,720
bronner's peppermint soap

852
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,599
um and that and then i use some

853
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,159
organicized

854
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,839
and then i use some green cleaner i

855
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,799
believe it is

856
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,480
um those were the three things that i

857
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,720
rotated

858
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,038
over about like every every third day or

859
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
every second day

860
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,640
because you can't just spray them every

861
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
single day because they the

862
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
the life cycle of the bug is you know

863
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,759
they the eggs

864
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
they hang out and they hatch then they

865
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,000
do whatever is different there's like

866
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,200
three different stages that you get

867
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,038
their life cycle

868
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,880
and it's a lot of work you know i

869
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,879
discovered these you know pump spray

870
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,799
spray bottles which are freaking awesome

871
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,320
but it also you know when you have a

872
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,398
problem like that you really have to

873
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,240
strip as much foliage off your plants as

874
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,959
you can

875
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,440
so you have the least amount of surface

876
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,759
area to cover with the the spray

877
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,159
because the [ __ ] grows back people don't

878
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,119
really um

879
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,720
it scares them understandably when you

880
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,798
strip a plant down to a stick

881
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,200
right yep what kind of leds are you

882
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:35,278
using these are from a company called

883
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,679
new tech i think it's n-u-e-t-e-c-k

884
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,119
if you people go to my uh youtube

885
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,960
channel

886
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,879
uh there's a link in the description to

887
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,440
the videos and they can actually get

888
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,440
like a template there we go

889
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,278
um they're light

890
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,120
uh and they can be daisy chained up to

891
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:58,159
five uh i've got three up and two down

892
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,678
um and they emit like 25 watts per

893
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,080
lamp i think okay they're like cool

894
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
cool temperature cool they just don't

895
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,918
get warm

896
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,719
uh they do not have any kind of built-in

897
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,320
fans like a lot of leds do

898
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,839
and they're super flight i mean they are

899
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,200
suspended

900
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,359
from the top of the grow tent by um

901
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,440
you know the plant wire twisty tash have

902
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,719
you heard of these mr growit

903
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,320
uh sorry i'm dealing with cat issues

904
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,079
my cat's messing over there messing up

905
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,319
the audio and stuff

906
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,319
oh sorry what are you talking about

907
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,759
there it's just a different kind of led

908
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,480
i mean they're the other ones i've seen

909
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,480
it i'm sure other people may have it

910
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,319
uh it's just like it's about it's a four

911
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,919
foot um

912
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,759
or like you know 45 inch

913
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,960
long strip with about let's see

914
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,440
so they've got eight lights eight small

915
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,759
lights i think the whole fixture itself

916
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,759
emits like 25 watts

917
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,119
uh and it's got the purple jupiter kind

918
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,158
of look

919
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,199
but um it's the plants

920
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,640
they really love it i'm sold on the on

921
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,440
these lights for vegging

922
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
absolutely are they priced right i mean

923
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,720
i know the pricing in the led world

924
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,519
ranges from super high to super super

925
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,558
low

926
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,839
if you build yourself you know i don't

927
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:20,319
think you can have less than three of

928
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,759
these and

929
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,759
you're if you've got a 10 like this

930
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,759
and i think they with the discount i

931
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,640
think they come up to 125 bucks

932
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,720
thereabouts

933
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,919
each which is not horrible because you

934
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,839
know what you're never going to replace

935
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,559
a bulb

936
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,439
um even if it's a cfl i mean cfl's are

937
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:42,319
60 bucks right so

938
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,640
you can get a you can get a cfl fixture

939
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,439
from hydro farm with the bulb

940
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,200
what all you need you know uh for sixty

941
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
dollars on amazon right

942
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,720
so the led is twice as much uh it's but

943
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,158
it's cooler temperature wise

944
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,798
it's lighter it's just easier

945
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,559
and i think it's i think the plants like

946
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,720
it more

947
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,319
nice that's awesome that's my feeling i

948
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,519
know i haven't really done many clones

949
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,200
under it so

950
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,640
i have to give you a disclaimer there

951
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,399
but i don't see why it would be a

952
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
problem

953
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,639
tell me uh what's the biggest yield

954
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,639
you've ever hit

955
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,600
how many lights were you using oh

956
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:25,089
probably like two and a half pounds

957
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,240
in like a three light room um

958
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:28,000
[Music]

959
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,919
my yields aren't are never really i'm

960
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
never really happy with my nails

961
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,320
i haven't really put that down you know

962
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
i'm still working on that

963
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,720
it's uh it's a source of frustration

964
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,640
but like we were talking about it's

965
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,960
really quality over quantity although i

966
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,480
did i grew a lot of skunk last year

967
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,278
i had a lot of skunk do you do anything

968
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
like do you

969
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,720
try last night do you use a trellis and

970
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
that or bamboo stakes or anything to

971
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
hold those

972
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,839
suckers up well you know

973
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,399
i did do a uh sort of a trellis knitting

974
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,759
uh two runs ago and that was kind of fun

975
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,918
but i didn't like the

976
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,278
uh the fact that everything was like in

977
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,838
a fixed position

978
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,358
it made it hard to water and i like to

979
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,719
put my plants and move it around

980
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,319
sometimes

981
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,918
um so i don't but i whether it's because

982
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,480
of my super cropping

983
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,398
or just what i'm feeding i'm feeding

984
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,000
them nectar for the gods which is a

985
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,960
calcium-based um i've heard it i've

986
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,159
heard of that

987
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,039
yeah you show us a lot of that

988
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,720
it's good stuff it's a good product um

989
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,159
but you know i have not had

990
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,759
to use sticks i did when i trellised i

991
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,919
had to use yo-yo clips

992
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
from the i've got like a sort of those

993
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,598
are awesome too

994
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,960
yeah they are very super helpful super

995
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,800
helpful i

996
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,918
saw those in a high grow hybrid video i

997
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,399

998
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,638
this

999

no he does like deep water culture

1000
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,760
growing does like the yo-yo

1001
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,879
clips from the ceiling and the trellis

1002
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,920
netting and

1003
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,358
builds his own systems from from scratch

1004
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,519
i don't know that's that's where i saw

1005
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,880
him the yo-yo things and i was sold as

1006
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,159
soon as i saw him like wow yeah and

1007
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,640
they're cheap you know

1008
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,159
flex each and they you they they have a

1009
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,598
couple lifetimes in them you know

1010
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,598
they're not gonna last forever but you

1011
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,119
can get some use out of them for sure

1012
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,680
let me ask you guys what was your like

1013
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,920
biggest fail or biggest catastrophe in a

1014
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,279
grow

1015
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,000
uh uh getting spooked and having to kill

1016
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,599
everything and

1017
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,199
clean the apartment out in about two

1018
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,119
hours uh

1019
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,679
really well yeah yeah what was the spook

1020
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,640
uh we thought the landlord was gonna

1021
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,759
call the cops on

1022
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,039
us and uh because we gave me gas they

1023
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,520
smelled it

1024
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,719
no we had an apartment we had two

1025
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,358
apartments in the same

1026
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,399
premises one basically above the other

1027
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,759
one

1028
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,838
and we were moving out of one and we

1029
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,000
hadn't really completely moved out uh

1030
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,078
and they somebody went in there

1031
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,159
uh from management without our

1032
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,200
permission and saw like the bathtub was

1033
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,039
filled with empty three-part bottles

1034
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,799
um but there were nutrients all over the

1035
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,320
place and there was like a half trim

1036
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,440
plant there

1037
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,559
and the guys these guys were rallies and

1038
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,400
they were flipping out

1039
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:22,000
and the guys who were at the super

1040
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,599
they were soul brothers you know we were

1041
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,199
very connected to them and um

1042
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,880
they gave us a heads up they didn't like

1043
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,719
you know sweet they they didn't get in

1044
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
the way of anything but they

1045
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,679
called my partner who lived up in the

1046
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,118
neighborhood and all that was a

1047
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,719
heartbreaking

1048
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,240
because these plants we had these plants

1049
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,519
that were just

1050
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,479
they were going to be flowering in like

1051
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,440
two weeks they were in dwc we had some

1052
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,119
skunk number one i had a bunch of [ __ ]

1053
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,159
and it was all

1054
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,760
ouch and uh but it had to be done it

1055
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,719
couldn't take up chance

1056
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,599
right better say that sorry yeah and

1057
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,358
then you know we

1058
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,640
we cooled off for a couple months

1059
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,639
somebody's gotta start back up

1060
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,480
new landlord no just a little bit more

1061
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,240
organized

1062
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,240
a little bit tighter tighter game

1063
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,920
not as sloppy although that building

1064
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,078
they had so many people renting out

1065
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,720
their apartments for airbnb to europeans

1066
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,640
it was insane

1067
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,480
every day there'd be a different foreign

1068
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,960
speaking person downstairs trying to get

1069
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,079
in

1070
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,519
it's the weirdest thing right airbnb is

1071
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,760
the best

1072
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,719
jay if you can go back in time and talk

1073
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
to yourself

1074
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,879
before you started your first grow what

1075
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,519
advice would you give to yourself

1076
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,200
wow my first bro knowing what you know

1077
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,679
now you go back in time and you tell

1078
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,949
yourself

1079
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,799
oh don't use miracle girl

1080
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:48,000
[Laughter]

1081
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
that's the first thing that comes to

1082
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,320
mind because that's the most

1083
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,519
obvious thing right it's funny though

1084
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,559
because you know when i was growing it

1085
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,960
was really you know

1086
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,159
the book i used was this murphy stevens

1087
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,000
guy

1088
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,399
and you know happy illustrations were

1089
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,480
like pencil drawings like cartoons

1090
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,160
i mean it was really very uh there was

1091

jorge cervantes no man

1093
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,440
but um i mean rosenthal's first book

1094
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
is probably about the same time

1095
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,159
cervantes probably

1096
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,720
contemporary contemporaries but that's

1097
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,319
