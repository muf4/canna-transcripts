1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,448
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,250
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it you

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,798
know watch a mattress Channel this is

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,509
the gross star a 600 watt cob LED grow

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,849
light I purchased this grow light off of

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,039
Amazon at a discount and in this video I

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,528
am going to unbox the unit and also test

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,629
the power output first thing out of the

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,368
box is the user manual has a ton of

10
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,528
information about the grow life it has

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,660
some various safety information usage

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,379
suggestions specifications about the

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,519
light and warranty terms next is a wire

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:35,789
hanging kit one rope ratchet hanger a

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,070
power cord which is 6 feet in length 3

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:41,219
reflector cups which go over the three

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,710
cob LEDs the cob LEDs on this grow light

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,140
our bridge Lux and epaulettes and they

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,759
are 200 watts each I won't be going over

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,619
all of the features on this LED grow

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,269
light I will provide a link in the

22
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,339
description section below is so you can

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,120
learn more for the part tests I'm going

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,910
to use the apogee

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,419
MQ 500 power meter this meter measures

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,819
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,489
plus or minus 5 nanometers and the

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,109
measurements are taken in ppfd I say

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,640
this in every video but this is just to

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,500
give you a general idea of what the

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,489
power output is it's not going to be a

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,379
hundred percent accurate

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,199
the reflective walls in the grow tent

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,478
could increase the numbers according to

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,290
the listing for this LED girl light it

36
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,500
has a core coverage of 3.9 feet by 5.8

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,600
feet which must be wrong this girl light

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,879
is a better fit for a 2 foot by 4 foot

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,489
grow space and I place this grow light

40
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,828
in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow Tim I'll be

41
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:37,798
taking measurements at 12 inches away 18

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,328
inches away and 24 inches away just like

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,100
all the other part test videos I do I

44
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:51,468
will let the measurements do the talking

45
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:51,468
