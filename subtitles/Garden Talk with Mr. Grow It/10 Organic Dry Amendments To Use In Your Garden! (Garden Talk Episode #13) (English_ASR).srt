1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
coming up on garden talk so if your

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
plant's kind of weak

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,080
and you're trying to train some of your

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,039
plants and get better growth

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
you got to train it and it snaps instead

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,039
of just kind of bending

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,519
well that's because a lot of it might be

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,038
not

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,679
enough silica that your plants are

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,199
getting are using or in available form

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,518
the chelation is a multivalent ion

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,840
with the cation exchange it's another

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,320
one of those cation exchanges that

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,880
it can chelate and change some of the

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,359
multivalent bonds ion bonds

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
and help with different plants to

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,238
chelate different nutrients or to lock

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,199
things out

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,238
enzymes are what help with how plants

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
express themselves

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,599
how they use nitrogen you know as a

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,759
newbie

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
keeping it simple i can grab a couple

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,198
boxes of a couple ingredients that have

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
some beneficial biology and some good

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,839
nutrients

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
and start with that

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960

medically

66
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
fit welcome to garden talk how you doing

67
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,639
doing good

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
how are you doing i'm doing great man

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,519
i'm super excited to have you on dude

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
i've actually been following your

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
channel since like 2013.

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
so you were like one of the first people

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,318
that i've actually started watching so

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
i'm like fanboying it out a little bit

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,919
that's interesting to me because i

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
didn't really know that you were kind of

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,119
a fan of mine

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
and so it's really nice to know that you

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,759
know you were one of the people who

80
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,878
actually like

81
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,799
i think you were one of the first people

82
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,719
to actually nudge me over to the organic

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
side of things i remember really came

84
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,560
onto my live stream one time and

85
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,479
i was like checking the ph of the runoff

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,840
and you're like why do you check the ph

87
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,280
with the organics you don't have to and

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,039
you're like come over to my world you

89
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
know come on

90
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
yeah yeah you were definitely an

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,439
inspiration for me to kind of

92
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,039
transitioning over i mean

93
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,959
the the amount of knowledge that you

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,878
have on the organic side of thing

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,640
is something i admire so i'm super

96
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,719
excited to have you on the show today

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,759
but um thanks for having me very glad to

98
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,680
be here

99
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,199
cool um so for those that don't know who

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,879
you are can you just tell us a little

101
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,839
bit about yourself and how you got into

102
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,280
growing

103
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,400
well um i've been a cultivators

104
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,360
since 2000 11 12-ish

105
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
started kind of learning uh when i lived

106
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
in las vegas

107
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:28,158
um back then i wanted to know about

108
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,919
cultivating vegetables and

109
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:36,479
additional you know plants for

110
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,679
me and nevada was a medical state so i

111
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,518
could

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
so i really wanted to kind of know and

113
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,680
that's what got me into it

114
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,519
um what kind of pushed me even harder is

115
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,799
i lost my father

116
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,158
and like being around

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,080
plants and just growing really helped

118
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,679
because i didn't have like the cognitive

119
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
skills and understand how to deal with

120
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,959
that type of loss in my life

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
and it really helped me deal with how to

122
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
get through the loss because i was able

123
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,598
to get in and kind of take care of

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
things and

125
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,039
like just sit there and be with the

126
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,438
plants and it was nice

127
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,000
and so medicinal plants you're only

128
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,120
fruits veggies are you indoors outdoors

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,720
or what um i do like

130
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,280
summertime we try to get our garden

131
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,639
going so we'll do vegetable crops

132
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,638
squash tomatoes peppers i try to do

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,240
some other like mints and herbs

134
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,720
for in the house outdoor

135
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
we do some municipal plants we just

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
recently moved to pueblo area

137
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
it's kind of harder to do it here the

138
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,279
heat

139
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,000
it's really dry it's sometimes almost

140
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,119
just as bad as living in las vegas

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,680
um but i do a lot more indoor

142
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
if possible um it's easier to control

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,439
some of my environment conditions i can

144
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,439
grow year-round

145
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,478
instead of just through the summer and

146
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,439
spring

147
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,038
seasons down here in pueblo we have a

148
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,959
little bit later fall so i can get a

149
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,839
little bit later crop outdoors if i need

150
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,560
to

151
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,359
for some of my vegetables so kind of a

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,439
little bit of both really nice nice

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
cool all right so let's get into the

154
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,600
topic today so we're going to talk all

155
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,478
about

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
dry amendments so there are so many

157
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,639
different

158
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,079
dry amendments that can be incorporated

159
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
in your garden right dozens of different

160
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,758
amendments

161
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
we're not going to be able to talk about

162
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,919
all of them today unfortunately we'll

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
talk about a handful of them

164
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,399
but you have a whole wealth of knowledge

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
in regards to a lot of these amendments

166
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,478
and that's really what i want to pick

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,800
your brain on today

168
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,719
i watched your video that you have on

169
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
dry nutrient tea

170
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
so your nutrient tea video and this kind

171
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,359
of inspired

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
the questions that i have for you today

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,038
i basically have a list of amendments

174
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
that we're going to go over for him and

175
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,079
have a feeling that a lot of my viewers

176
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,478
aren't even going to like be aware

177
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,758
of these amendments so um i guess this

178
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,279
would probably maybe be like a more

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
intermediate slash

180
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,559
advanced type topic you know because a

181
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,399
lot of these things that we talk about

182
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
they're they're not used

183
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:07,758
in a lot of um normally used

184
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,720
application garden settings like

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,600
some of the amendments that i use most

186
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
people don't use

187
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,199
in their garden settings i do it for

188
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,319
a specific reason and most of my reason

189
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
is

190
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
everything that i've been learning and

191
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,318
understanding from

192
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
all of the self-taught education growing

193
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,000
up in iowa

194
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279
around farmers trying to learn you know

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
understand

196
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:39,198
cultivation it's about diversity

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,360
and so i try to use a vast

198
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
variety of different dry organic

199
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
amendments and most people are like oh

200
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,879
that's a lot

201
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,799
well i don't know what the plant wants

202
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,279
or needs

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
i try to give it everything possible

204
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,439
that makes sense

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,439
so let's just get right into it then

206
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,399
let's uh let's start with gypsum

207
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,478
so that's one of the things that you

208
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,519
incorporate and so talk to us about

209
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,240
gypsum what you know what are the

210
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,120
benefits

211
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,519
how do you apply it so on and so forth

212
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,000
well

213
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:11,680
gypsum is it's a calcium

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,240
and a sulfur kind of

215
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:21,519
powder it's really water soluble uh

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,439
it works great for a lot of people

217
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,279
find that their plants or soil are like

218
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,598
calcium deficient or the plants

219
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,279
have a little bit of calcium deficient

220
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,719
this is pretty

221
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,839
high amendment like 22 percent calcium

222
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
and like 17

223
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,239
sulfur in some of this so it's pretty

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
high

225
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,879
there's several different ways you can

226
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,639
mix it in i do

227
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,319
a tea i will mix it in a super soil mix

228
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,000
when i'm trying to make

229
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,680
like a soil to grow in

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so there's a couple different

231
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
applications um

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,160
a lot of people really just do it more

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,360
as a top feeding

234
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,919
or a soil you know like a uh

235
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,680
super soil like i'm saying or a tea um

236
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,000
just from the solubility

237
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
uh kind of repeat myself a little bit

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
sorry

239
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
um some of it also helps with like root

240
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,360
growth

241
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,720
nutrient uptake uh cation exchange

242
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,000
calcium really does a lot for the plant

243
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,919
and this is part of what we're

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
trying to do is get the plant these

245
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:33,360
available nutrients

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,759
gypsum has calcium sulfur

247
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,038
readily available to it so that's what

248
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,080
we're trying to do

249
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,439
um a lot of what really i found

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
very interesting because a lot of people

251
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
are concerned

252
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,719
with some of my soil mixes being high in

253
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
heavy metals

254
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,480
well gypsum actually helps to reduce

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,600
some of these heavy metal toxins from

256
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,879
manganese to boron to aluminum it kind

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,639
of binds it up so

258
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,559
the plant can't uptake it and so

259
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,559
when a lot of people are concerned about

260
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,399
like using trace miserals

261
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,679
trace minerals like azomite that we're

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,440
going to talk about

263
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,838
that's one of them that kind of has some

264
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
higher heavy metals to it

265
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,640
but this will help prevent those heavy

266
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,278
metals from being uptaken in the plant

267
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,559
so it's really interesting it helps with

268
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,679
soil structure

269
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,039
runoff um kind of helps retain water a

270
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,559
little bit

271
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:34,000
instead of allowing it to run off um

272
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:37,199
balances the ph kind of like

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,039
what dolomite lime can do real

274
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,959
similar but it's actually to me and if

275
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,240
quite a few other people gypsum's better

276
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,559
than dolomite lime

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,600
in some ways so there's a lot of really

278
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,159
interesting information that comes with

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
just gypsum itself i know you use the

280
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,759
down to earth

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
gypsum yes when we talk about

282
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,240
application rates

283
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,639
i mean i know you said you can use it as

284
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,919
like a rich soil conditioner

285
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,278
also as a top rest do you know the

286
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,679
application rates off top of your head

287
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,958
or

288
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,359
just refer to the box um i do

289
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,159
and i don't so i'll give it to you in a

290
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
two-part

291
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:19,439
deal depending on the size of

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,919
pot gallon to bale

293
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,440
like my measurements that i have already

294
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,240
on like some of my super

295
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
soil it's made out for a bale so it can

296
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,680
be

297
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,759
anywhere from a cup and a half to six

298
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,439
cups just depending on

299
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,439
how much you're really trying to add to

300
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,240
it if you're trying to make it

301
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,519
in a super soil in a five gallon pot

302
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,639
it's like

303
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,000
two tablespoons three tablespoons so

304
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,278
it it really varies on each of these

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,720
depending on per gallon per pot or

306
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,320
the amount of soil you're trying to make

307
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
so i can give you you know kind of a

308
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,480
just answer but

309
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,759
i'm assuming that most of your audience

310
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,759
are going to make different

311
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,799
sizes of this when they go to use some

312
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,319
of it so

313
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,879
really look on the box see what they

314
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,480
recommend down the earth has

315
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,159
on their website kind of tells you a

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,639
little bit you can also

317
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,399
google and some of them do tell a little

318
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,639
different application rates

319
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
um so kind of just do a little research

320
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,639
to see what you

321
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
what you like i play around a little bit

322
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,439
when i add it

323
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,679
sometimes i add more of it sometimes i

324
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
have less of it i kind of see what my

325
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,359
plant is wanting and what's needing so

326
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,518
it's not quite dialed in but i i still

327
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,560
play with my recipe a little bit so

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,799
gotcha azomite you mentioned azamite

329
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,559
uh briefly let's talk about that what is

330
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,919
azomite what are the benefits how do you

331
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,679
apply it

332
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,799
azomite is a very interesting deal

333
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,078
it's rock dust that's from ancient

334
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,159
volcanoes

335
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,159
that it's harvested this is where we

336
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,199
talk about some of the heavier minerals

337
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,480
being in the

338
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,680
in the dirt itself because of

339
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
everything that's coming up from the

340
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,958
volcano aluminum

341
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,958
magnesium copper lead like

342
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:15,679
arsenic heavy toxin metals

343
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:17,759
but it's not so high that i'm concerned

344
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,439
because most of the benefits of trace

345
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,399
minerals

346
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,279
you as humans are we as humans and our

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,159
plants both need trace minerals for

348
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,519
major and hormonal functions within the

349
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,679
plant

350
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,360
so believe it or not the plant does need

351
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,519
lead it does need arsenic

352
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,000
it does need copper zinc boron aluminum

353
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,879
not in such high doses but they need it

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
for

355
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:48,000
major and minor functions of how we act

356
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,440
how different chemicals are sent

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,278
you know through our body through the

358
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,079
plant different hormones

359
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,078
so this really helps the plant basically

360
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:59,199
be in the homeostasis

361
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:03,359
so if we can get the

362
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,399
all the trace macro micro nutrients

363
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,039
that's kind of what rock dust azomite is

364
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,278
doing

365
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,039
is giving us that whole variety of all

366
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,559
these different trace minerals

367
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,078
that we don't get from other fertilizers

368
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,359
or amendments

369
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,958
and what that same thing is soil

370
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,560
amendment stools to begin with and also

371
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,000
as a top dress or what would you

372
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,838
recommend

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,559
i do it i'll add it to both my teas one

374
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,040
for veg

375
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,039
one for flour just depending on the

376
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,240
cycle i still add it

377
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:39,439
i do add it to my soil amendments when

378
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,519
i'm doing a top dress

379
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,480
i don't do so much of a top dress with

380
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,720
it because

381
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
that's where most my tees i'm trying to

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,519
get some of the solubility

383
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,440
if i think i'm having issues then i'm

384
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,198
looking more at my super soil recipe

385
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
that i made

386
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,439
instead of looking at like okay what's

387
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,278
going on with my plant

388
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
is it because i'm not getting trace

389
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,639
minerals

390
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,559
most of the time i don't have

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,360
deficiencies with trace minerals just

392
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,958
because

393
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,839
um i add more than most

394
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,799
because i don't know how much the plant

395
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,440
actually needs

396
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,639
and it needs different minerals at

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,639
different times

398
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,639
of its cycle so if i can get the variety

399
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,839
and let the biology and the soil kind of

400
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,759
do what it does

401
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,760
the plant will regulate when it wants it

402
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,720
when it needs it and i just kind of sit

403
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,679
back

404
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,839
rock phosphate what is it what are the

405
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,479
benefits how do you apply it

406
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
rock phosphate is really interesting

407
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,199
because

408
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:44,719
at first i used to use

409
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:47,759
um i'm trying to remember it's a

410
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,079
bottle of b vitamins um

411
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,879
it's like plant hormones so rock

412
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,198
phosphate

413
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:58,320
is kind of doing that it's a phosphorus

414
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,359
um that's like the b vitamin

415
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,839
complex that the plant needs for energy

416
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,720
for uh different functions like uh

417
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,240
nutrient fix or nitrogen fixation where

418
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
the plant will take different types of

419
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,198
nitrogen and change it to usable

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,480
forms it's something that

421
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,759
it helps with photosynthesis that plants

422
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,879
really

423
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:26,399
photosynthesis is key it

424
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:30,399
it helps the energy the atp and how the

425
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,039
plant uses energy to create its sugars

426
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
produces

427
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,679
its flowers you know and with its growth

428
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
so

429
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,838
that's kind of what this rock phosphate

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
is is that b

431
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,279
complex energy that helps overall with

432
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
plant growth

433
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,559
how do you usually use it um this is

434
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
it comes a couple different ways it

435
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,479
comes granular or

436
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
powder so most of the time i'll mix it

437
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,278
in a tea

438
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,720
try to get the solubility of it not all

439
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,039
of it soluble

440
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,879
um so that's when if i'm trying to amend

441
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,198
the soil i'll just

442
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,799
take that and put it in the soil kind of

443
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,000
help amend it

444
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:11,758
same thing super soil um if i'm making

445
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,519
a bail um i'll probably use

446
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,639
three cups for one cubic bale

447
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,799
so if i was doing like a five gallon pot

448
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,198
maybe like three tablespoons not

449
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,559
teaspoons tablespoons

450
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,679
because most of it is in tablespoons

451
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,559
it's pretty interesting don't see much

452
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,679
of their

453
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,559
nutrients are on their line or any dry

454
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,599
amendment really

455
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,518
using teaspoons unless you're really

456
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,879
doing like a hydroponic setup or

457
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,879
something along that line

458
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,399
now correct me if i'm wrong rock

459
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,360
phosphate and some of these other

460
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
amendments

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
some are going to take longer to break

462
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,360
down right those microbes that are

463
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,439
breaking down those nutrients

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,278
is rock phosphate one of the ones that

465
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,600
take longer like i've heard

466
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,639
on some of these amendments that it

467
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
takes

468
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,120
it can take a year to potentially break

469
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,519
down well that's like

470
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,119
green sand for instance and we'll kind

471
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,959
of talk about that later but

472
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,159
greens hands one of them that literally

473
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,558
takes 12 to 14 months before it really

474
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
gets

475
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,000
available so yes some of this

476
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,599
takes a while to get and become

477
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,959
available

478
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,159
they're a different breakdown how do i

479
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,519
say

480
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,079
some of it is quick some of it may take

481
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,839
a few

482
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,159
weeks some of it may take a few months

483
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,519
depends on the biology

484
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,000
what the plants really asking for so it

485
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,918
it varies on what's really happening in

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,079
your rib zone with the biology

487
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,520
because that's going to be a big thing

488
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,399
that's why a lot of times when i'm

489
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,440
making teas

490
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,480
i'm looking for that solubility of it

491
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,558
where it's readily available almost like

492
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,319
i'm creating a bottle nutrient

493
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,079
getting that solubility ready and then

494
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
feeding it to my plant

495
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,119
got it when you talk about solubility

496
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,839
you're talking about basically turning

497
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,719
it into a plant available form

498
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,319
correct a liquid form where it takes

499
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,279
some of that nutrients

500
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,038
and gets it to where it's soluble in the

501
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,160
liquid form

502
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,038
as in insoluble means it's not able to

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,279
break down

504
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,879
through water cool how about uh

505
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,359
langbanite

506
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
i like that language it's pretty

507
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,399
interesting because it's

508
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,480
pretty much potash it's pretty much

509
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
potassium a little bit of magnesium and

510
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
sulfur

511
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,038
it's one of those that i put in my soil

512
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,199
mixes

513
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,839
when i'm mixing my super soil but when

514
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,160
it comes to my teas

515
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,678
i try to use it more for flour when my

516
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,919
plants are ready to go

517
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
to produce their fruit when they're

518
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
flowering when they're ready

519
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,280
to just try to get more flower

520
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,720
development

521
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,639
it's one thing that i'll really kind of

522
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
use it's all soluble

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,320
it's kind of like a salt but it

524
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
when it hits water it will dissolve

525
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,639
basically in the water

526
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,000
it helps with chlorophyll within the

527
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
plant

528
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,079
to help get chlorophyll because we

529
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,160
didn't plants need it to kind of help

530
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,000
with photosynthesis

531
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,000
so that's one thing that's kind of key

532
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,359
about using some of this potash

533
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,960
or this langmanite is it only

534
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,199
not only helps with that but it helps

535
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,759
with like the sulfur part of it helps

536
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,840
with

537
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,839
enzyme activation

538
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,199
so it kind of helps some of the enzymes

539
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,599
the proteins

540
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,600
in the plant kind of being able to be

541
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,918
broke down and used

542
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,839
and that's kind of like important

543
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,360
because enzymes are what help

544
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:46,319
with how plants express themselves

545
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,279
how they use nitrogen how they kind of

546
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,759
develop

547
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,000
so it's really interesting on how some

548
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:55,599
of like these simple dry amendments

549
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,160
really work on different cellular

550
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,279
levels of the plant and we don't really

551
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,679
realize that

552
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,960
just using them how often do you apply

553
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,400
it do you do a top dressing at all or

554
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
just a soil conditioner

555
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,120
uh more of a soil conditioner um if i

556
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,959
wanted to do a top dressing because it's

557
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,639
water soluble it would break down pretty

558
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,679
quickly i'd probably use it

559
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:20,400
in a beginning stages of flour and fruit

560
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,480
um like if i was flipping like say my

561
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,519
medicinal plants

562
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,120
and i would put it in like maybe two

563
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,119
weeks before they really went in the

564
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,119
flower

565
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,158
because then it's letting the plant kind

566
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,639
of know hey

567
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
things are happening things are changing

568
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
you know we're getting different

569
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,158
nutrients

570
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,159
and it's kind of where

571
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
how people will kind of help the plant

572
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
along

573
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,639
doing things before you really put it

574
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,038
into those cycles and that's kind of one

575
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
of them

576
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,720
that would be something i would do

577
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,558
dolomite lime

578
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
so i think that's probably one of that a

579
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,440
lot of people have heard of it's pretty

580
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,079
common

581
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,558
talk to us about that a lot of people

582
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,839
use

583
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,319
dolomite line for soil conditioning

584
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,319
a lot of people that have acidic soil

585
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,279
dolomite lime helps really buffer and

586
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,399
brings up the

587
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,960
acidity level to more of a neutral

588
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
and so if you're growing blueberries you

589
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,319
want more acidic

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,919
soil so you really don't want some of

591
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,480
this dolomite lime

592
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,640
but if you're growing plants that

593
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,599
certain crops that more want

594
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,559
your ph to be around six to seven and

595
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,038
your soil

596
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,720
or your water is like a fork this

597
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,798
dolomite lime is going to help

598
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
balance it out as it's kind of breaking

599
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,759
down over time

600
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
it's high in calcium just like the

601
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,038
gypsum

602
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,558
that's why i try to use both of them

603
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,599
there are two different forms

604
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,279
of calcium and

605
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,639
i'm letting the biology kind of break it

606
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,119
down and the plant

607
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,919
take it up and however you know it's

608
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:00,558
it's going to be available for it

609
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,720
um zolomite lime also has magnesium

610
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,480
so when a lot of people are like oh i'm

611
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,360
having calmag

612
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
problems well i don't quite have that

613
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,439
using

614
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,640
dolomite lime there's so much magnesium

615
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,880
to it that

616
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,880
i shouldn't be having any issues and if

617
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
i am it's because it's not

618
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
in a form that my plant's able to take

619
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
it up now follow-up question on this one

620
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
say

621
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,240
hypothetical say you have a grower's

622
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,240
using synthetic nutrients

623
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
he gets himself into a bind maybe he

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,679
checks his runoff ph

625
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,480
realizes like the low fives needs to

626
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,400
increase that ph wants to utilize

627
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
dolomite lime to do that

628
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
would you recommend that and then how

629
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,720
long would it take to actually adjust

630
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
up that much see that's a good question

631
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,400
because

632
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,279
i haven't really tried that to see

633
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,559
what the solubility is going to do with

634
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,759
ph

635
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,720
so me adding it to uh

636
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,158
a hydroponic i don't know how fast the

637
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,440
ph is going to raise in it

638
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,280
or how much i'm going to have to use for

639
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
the setup because if i have a small

640
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,879
setup

641
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,839
it may be like a tablespoon or a

642
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,960
teaspoon

643
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,240
but if i have say 10 buckets that i'm

644
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,480
running like a

645
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,200
dwc or hydroponic setup it may take

646
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,079
a quarter cup gotcha okay so no clear

647
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,080
answer on that one

648
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,759
no not really because i don't i would i

649
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,240
don't play with that enough to really

650
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,359
say

651
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,599
hey if you use it in this fashion this

652
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,439
is

653
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,199
your what your results are going to be

654
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,000
okay oyster shell

655
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,400
talk to us about that that's another

656
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
great calcium product

657
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,759
like i don't ever really

658
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,960
seem to have problems with calcium in my

659
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,038
soil

660
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
because i have so many different

661
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,278
variances

662
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,600
of getting it in oyster shell

663
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,278
helps strengthen the calcium this is

664
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,000
where it comes back to the calcium again

665
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,798
it helps strengthen cell walls it helps

666
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,759
with different

667
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:07,119
enzymes um the production in the soil

668
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,798
the shells also give the biology in your

669
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,959
roots or in the soil

670
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,599
like surface area to live off and build

671
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,600
colonies

672
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,360
oyster shell it's not talked about

673
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,079
a lot but it's it's almost like crab

674
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,558
shell

675
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,278
it it can have some kitenase to it i

676
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,960
believe

677
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,558
but nobody's really talking about it and

678
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,679
i haven't seen it but

679
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:33,119
there's a similar product it's a silica

680
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,440
based carbon based type shell that

681
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,599
to me would have almost like chitin what

682
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,278
crab shell does but

683
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,959
i'm not positive on it i haven't seen a

684
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,278
lot of information on that

685
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,278
and so this can be used soil conditioner

686
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,000
can be used as a top dress all these can

687
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,640
really be used

688
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,519
kind of the same fashion is that correct

689
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,080
yes

690
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,519
and no there's some products that are

691
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,639
more soluble

692
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,319
than others so when it comes to making

693
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,520
teas

694
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,720
some of the products are going to

695
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,200
release more of solubility

696
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,000
it because that's it they're more

697
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
soluble

698
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,640
others are not so if you're trying to

699
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,038
make a tea with say

700
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
oyster shell it may have to sit a little

701
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,440
longer to break down to get some of the

702
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,400
solubility out of it

703
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,679
as where the lang banite it may sit in

704
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,759
there 20 minutes and already be

705
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,080
dissolved and ready to use

706
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,440
so it does come back to once again some

707
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,319
of the breakdown of

708
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
the solubility of these products if

709
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,079
you're going to make a tea

710
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,360
you have to wait for it if you're going

711
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,240
to do a top dress

712
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,839
or amend the soil with it you can put it

713
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
right in and let the soil

714
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,119
cook and do what it's going to do and

715
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
use it in a couple

716
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,038
30 days or so that makes sense how long

717
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,240
do you usually brew your teas

718
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,480
um 24 to 48 hours

719
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
most of them depend on the temperature

720
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
and

721
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
what i'm really trying to get in my

722
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,798
micro community

723
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
and how large of community i'm trying to

724
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,720
build

725
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,759
if i'm trying to water a lot of plants i

726
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
may

727
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,038
do more of a heavier tea where i dilute

728
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
it

729
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,798
a little bit more after it's been

730
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,158
brewing

731
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,720
that way i can disperse it out and have

732
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,520
a higher count to my watering sometimes

733
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
i'll just do

734
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:23,359
a smaller dosage where i'm like 24 hours

735
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,158
just get a little bit in the water and

736
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,759
then

737
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,559
apply it to my plants and my soil

738
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,440
green sand let's talk about it what is

739
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,480
it

740
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,480
it's basically silica

741
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,759
it's a it's trace minerals

742
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,759
like iron manganese

743
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,319
um it's how do i want to say it's

744
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,240
really different because a lot of like

745
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,720
the green sand that i get is from

746
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,640
glacier rock area where it's really been

747
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,839
pounded and all these trace minerals

748
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,960
from being ground

749
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,678
for however long these glaciers took to

750
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,360
move across

751
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:07,519
the continent a lot of it's

752
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:10,558
really fine particles almost

753
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,278
like uh sand like sand

754
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,319
but it's more minerals and not so much

755
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,038
sand

756
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,079
so it's like if you went to the beach

757
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,278
all the sand that you see

758
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,000
it's going to be a little different than

759
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,480
what green sand is

760
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,839
even though it has some trace minerals

761
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,360
to it green sand is going to be a little

762
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,959
bit higher because it's like

763
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:36,479
an iron content potash

764
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,278
it has like cation exchange

765
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,759
um where it helps pull up nutrients from

766
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,759
the soil

767
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,520
where like calcium is one of those

768
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,558
things that helps

769
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:52,639
with cation exchange where it helps

770
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:55,440
certain nutrients be taken up

771
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,278
through an ion exchange and that's kind

772
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,038
of the same thing of what people try to

773
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,919
do with bottled nutrients is they try to

774
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,759
create that

775
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,320
cat ion exchange where it's being pulled

776
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,038
up with all these ions

777
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,918
and that's similar to what green sand is

778
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,079
going to kind of do

779
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,200
but it's in an organic sense it's

780
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,278
straight silica

781
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
silica also helps with like the

782
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,000
strengthening of cell walls

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,038
and just as well so if your plant's kind

784
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,880
of weak

785
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,519
and you're trying to train some of your

786
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,240
plants and get better growth

787
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,558
you've got to train it and it snaps

788
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,440
instead of just kind of bending

789
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,918
well that's because a lot of it might be

790
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,519
not

791
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,320
enough silica that your plants are

792
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,759
getting are using or in available form

793
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,359
because silica comes in several

794
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,798
different forms

795
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,519
from using like horsetail horsetail is a

796
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,480
another natural product for silica but

797
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,398
that has to take time to break down

798
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,599
just like green sand it's one of those

799
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,359
that's the 12 to 14 month time to break

800
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,038
down

801
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,839
so even if i'm trying to use it now

802
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,000
it's not going to work because like

803
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,439
medicinal users

804
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,278
they plant it pot it four months later

805
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,080
it's done

806
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,880
vegetable gardens plant it pot it

807
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,359
produce

808
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
done well this is something that you

809
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,158
want to use more in like a

810
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,480
no-till setup where it has time to break

811
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,278
down

812
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,038
and actually be in the soil help really

813
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,440
build the structure in it

814
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,480
it's funny did you say cation exchange

815
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
and i uh

816
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,798
i just filmed a podcast episode and uh

817
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
it was released well it would be

818
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,319
released last week

819
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,558
and i pronounced vacation exchange and

820
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,918
that's the improper way and i'm

821
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:41,759
i'm gonna hear it in the comment section

822
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,080
i know that well here's what's funny

823
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,200
when you look at how it's spelled it's

824
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,439
c-a-t-i-o-n

825
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,519
so you would think that just looking at

826
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,919
it but until you've heard it a few times

827
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,119
to

828
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,559
recognize and go oh that's cat ion yeah

829
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,079
just like uh chelating

830
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,398
right chelating it looks like it's

831
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,519
chelating spelled chelating

832
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:06,558
yes it's ch but anyways

833
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,440
um okay cool uh how about granular humic

834
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,158
acids

835
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,880
let's talk about those humic acids are

836
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,960
one of those

837
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,760
things that it's created over a long

838
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,319
period of time

839
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,359
there's fulvic in humic acid both are

840
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,678
kind of

841
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,038
takes a long time to develop and humic

842
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,320
acid

843
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,720
comes from like leonard

844
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,359
leonardite slate it's from a slate

845
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,679
almost like a clay material

846
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,918
have you ever seen slate walking around

847
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,399
like beaches or

848
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,399
um like around the great lakes midwest

849
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,839
there's a lot of slate along the

850
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,918
riverbed area

851
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,319
so it's pretty interesting it just it's

852
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,440
real it's like a rock but it's so

853
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,480
thin and it's so slippery that

854
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,558
it's weird because slate

855
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,399
the what is it this product is made from

856
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:07,759
it actually helps to chelate

857
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:11,839
different heavy metals

858
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:15,278
it's very weird what humic acid does

859
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:18,480
and it actually can detoxify

860
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,759
heavy minerals and soil so going back to

861
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,120
the azomite

862
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,038
heavy minerals heavy metals

863
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,398
this is one of those other products that

864
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:32,000
can lock it up so it can't be taken up

865
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:35,599
by the plant so on top

866
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,519
of gypsum kind of helping the plant

867
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,759
with the detox of these heavy metals

868
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
this kind of locks some of it up

869
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,038
the humic acid locks it up so the plant

870
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
can't take it up

871
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,960
so when i'm using trace minerals that

872
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,960
are sometimes heavier

873
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,000
or hit have higher doses of heavy metals

874
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,840
that's one that i can actually use to

875
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,759
block it out that's what's nice about

876
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,918
um because it does the chelation's a

877
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,960
multivalent

878
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,799
ion with the cat ion exchange it's

879
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,600
another one of those cation exchanges

880
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,038
that

881
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,000
it can chelate and change some of the

882
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,599
multivalent bonds ion

883
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,599
bonds and help with different plants to

884
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,719
chelate different nutrients or to lock

885
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,959
things out

886
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,399
in more simpler terms the way i was

887
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,399
explained to it you can correct me if

888
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,199
i'm wrong on this one

889
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,439
the chelation is kind of like putting

890
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,840
nutrients into like an envelope right

891
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,278
and and making it more available for

892
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,439
uptake is it

893
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:42,159
yes in a sense so certain

894
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,558
nutrients come in different forms that

895
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,960
are not available

896
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:52,240
so say you have calcium or

897
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,679
here's a great one iron if you have

898
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,440
iron in your soil a lot of people are

899
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,960
like oh it's a heavy metal your plant's

900
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,120
going to uptake it well

901
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,000
not necessarily if it's not chelated

902
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,798
to an available form the plant can take

903
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
up

904
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,639
it's not going to use it even though

905
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,600
it's in the soil

906
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,038
and that's what a lot of chelation is

907
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,678
about

908
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,879
making different nutrients available in

909
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,000
a different form

910
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,480
than what they are all right bio

911
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,319
live talk to us about that down to earth

912
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,038
bio live is the one that i believe you

913
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,960
use

914
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:33,440
it is um they also have a bio fish and

915
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,360
bio thrive i think there's a couple

916
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,798
different in their bio lines

917
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:42,398
but what it is is a different

918
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:45,679
blend of multiple

919
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,959
down to earth amendments from kelp to

920
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,000
soybean mill to gypsum so it's

921
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,919
a variety of all these ingredients

922
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,519
and one but what they added was

923
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:03,038
beneficial fungi and bacteria

924
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,079
both endo ecto microrhizal

925
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,278
fungi there's several different strands

926
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,319
of bacteria

927
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:14,320
some of them uh the bacillus if i recall

928
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,039
um but that's what i use it for is to

929
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,240
get those

930
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,639
endo and ectomycorrhizal fungi in there

931
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,559
and not just the arbescule

932
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,919
fungi because there are several

933
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:29,759
different ones that come from different

934
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,398
nutrient lines um

935
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,359
that all of not all of them are the same

936
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,638
type of

937
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,159
fungi or microarrizal fungi so

938
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,559
i'm trying to get once again a

939
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,320
biodiversity

940
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,199
just like my nutrients i'm trying to do

941
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,599
the same thing in my soil so that bio

942
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,759
line really helps with what i'm doing in

943
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,480
the soil in the soil biology

944
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,399
because a lot of like what we're talking

945
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
about today we haven't really gone into

946
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,799
some of the soil biology

947
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,519
parts of it but some of these other

948
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
amendments

949
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,639
also really help with

950
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,839
what we're trying to do with not just

951
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,838
the

952
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:11,440
diversity and soil amendments but the

953
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:14,239
diversity and the soil biology

954
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,920
because that's they go hand in hand and

955
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,799
you're talking about the microorganisms

956
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,559
right when you're talking about the

957
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
biology right the actual

958
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,559
organism everything in the soil around

959
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,559
the root zone

960
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,759
um that's in the top couple inches of

961
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,440
your soil where

962
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
everything kind of breaks all the

963
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,880
nutrients down and that's where your

964
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,598
plants kind of get their

965
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
roots to these areas to create exudates

966
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,039
for these

967
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,599
to do that symbiotic exchange of

968
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,599
nutrients to sugars and carbs and

969
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,640
and then for the the bio live i'm

970
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,480
looking at it right now

971
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:49,679
it's a 542 mpk so would you say

972
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,159
that this is more beneficial in just in

973
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,960
veg

974
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:56,000
or can this be used in flour as well you

975
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,159
could use it in flour

976
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
it being higher in nitrogen is not an

977
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,078
issue

978
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,800
plants are still looking to take up

979
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,240
nitrogen

980
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,280
in flower cycle they're not using as

981
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,959
much

982
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,359
but they're yet they're still using

983
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,720
nitrogen to help development

984
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:18,319
and so using that would not be an issue

985
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:21,118
on either veg or flour

986
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,280
i use it in both the other part using it

987
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,240
in vet or in flour would be

988
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,280
the beneficial bacteria and fungi

989
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,559
because

990
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:35,280
if you're an indoor cultivator

991
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,358
re-inoculating the soil every so often

992
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,519
to make sure that

993
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:43,519
the species are there that the plants

994
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,838
looking for certain ones for certain

995
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,239
nutrients to take up

996
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,039
so that's what part of that diversity is

997
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,279
so if

998
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,960
they're dying off you're just trying to

999
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,880
you know re-inoculate and get them back

1000
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
into the soil at that time

1001
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,240
all right let's switch it up to next one

1002
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,760
bokashi

1003
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,159
talk to us about that actually just got

1004
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
some bokashi using it for the first time

1005
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,000
yeah not the group it's called growkashi

1006
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,760
that's the brand i guess

1007
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,760
got it from build a soil and started

1008
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,400
using it just sprinkled it like two days

1009
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,359
ago

1010
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,599
so talk to us about that um well it

1011
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,480
depends there's several different brands

1012
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,960
on the market

1013
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,400
several different companies some of it

1014
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,358
is just a

1015
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:28,400
wheat brand oat brand pikashi some of it

1016
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:31,440
has rice holes

1017
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,440
some of it has

1018
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,719
biochar mixed in with it so it just

1019
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,039
depends on the companies

1020
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,799
that you're getting it from like elevate

1021
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,400
organics is one that does some rice

1022
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,079
holes in biochar

1023
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,880
um build a soil

1024
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,079
they have one that's has rice holes in a

1025
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,640
wheat brand i believe

1026
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,480
that even if you had bokashi or if you

1027
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,319
had compost at home you can throw it on

1028
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,880
and create your own bokashi

1029
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,920
so what bokashi is is like three to four

1030
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,838
strains

1031
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,599
of anaerobic bacteria

1032
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,279
people think anaerobic bacteria is bad

1033
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,519
but these are the ones that are actually

1034
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,560
beneficial and good for the soil

1035
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,838
they help different functions within the

1036
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,559
plant

1037
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,039
they help break down different organic

1038
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,078
matter

1039
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,159
and different amendments that the plant

1040
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,720
really enjoy

1041
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,480
so these three or four strands are like

1042
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,519
yeast

1043
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,039
lactose bacillus and then like a purple

1044
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,880
non-sulfur are like

1045
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,639
what's commonly found in the what

1046
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,559
bokashi is

1047
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,719
and also it's really doing is helping

1048
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,119
get fungal communities

1049
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,279
are because bakashi's supposed to help

1050
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,280
build fungal communities

1051
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,920
but it's weird because it's an anaerobic

1052
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,920
bacteria

1053
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
but to me it's the way it breaks down

1054
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
everything in the soil that the fungal

1055
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,519
communities then want to come in

1056
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,599
and start helping kind of like

1057
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,639
it's weird because some of these fungal

1058
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,079
bile and

1059
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,039
bacterial communities really work

1060
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,000
symbiotically

1061
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,880
and you'll find communities and

1062
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,039
understand that

1063
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:20,079
like some are bad

1064
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:23,039
like different anaerobic bacteria can be

1065
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,519
bad and harmful to the soil

1066
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:30,400
and that's where a lot of aerobic

1067
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,159
biology help go in the soil kind of get

1068
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,400
rid of the bad pathogens

1069
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,719
the anaerobic if your soil

1070
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,680
is getting more oxygen to it will help

1071
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,959
get rid of a lot of

1072
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,519
the bad pathogens in there and that's

1073
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,039
where

1074
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,559
understanding the difference between

1075
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:51,199
like these are

1076
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:54,799
beneficial anaerobic as versus the bad

1077
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:57,919
anaerobic bacteria that makes sense

1078
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,800
and then one thing about bokashi

1079
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,440
is like really it it creates that white

1080
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,560
mycelium layer right across the soil

1081
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
which is pretty cool i had a lot of

1082
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,920
people hit me up to like

1083
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,599
what is this you know they all panic

1084
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,639
mode it's actually a good thing

1085
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,880
to see that mycelium layer across

1086
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,400
um and that's what's really helping that

1087
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
break down especially when you have it

1088
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,318
like

1089
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,838
when you top dress it right and have it

1090
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:20,559
over those nutrients that you maybe this

1091
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,519
top dress

1092
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,599
that's probably one of the more

1093
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,400
beneficial ways to do it right it would

1094
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,318
really help

1095
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,920
break things down a little bit quicker

1096
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,480
because that's what bokashi is really

1097
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,519
used for

1098
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
is for composting breaking down organic

1099
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,199
matter

1100
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,280
that's where you can create your own

1101
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,039
bokashi at home

1102
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,319
with a couple different ingredients like

1103
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,119
blackstrap molasses

1104
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,679
some oat or wheat brand or rice holes

1105
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,079
and then some e-m1

1106
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,078
and you can create your own bokashi or

1107
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,000
you can get bokashi and sprinkle

1108
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,000
on your compost and let it start

1109
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,838
breaking it down

1110
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,400
and if you really went got some yeast

1111
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,239
and some brown sugar molasses and you

1112
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,079
sprinkle that on compost it would

1113
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,439
start breaking it down as well because

1114
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,720
yeast is part of

1115
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,639
what akashi is so it's really

1116
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,239
interesting how you can create your own

1117
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,358
bokashi

1118
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,118
if you really wanted to or get it

1119
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,838
started breaking down your compost from

1120
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,800
these other

1121
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,318
like uh companies out there that is

1122
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,839
pretty interesting it makes growing fun

1123
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:24,800
too doing trying out new things like

1124
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,759
that

1125
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,280
looking at the growkashi directions

1126
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,040
right now just read it off so it says it

1127
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,359
can be used as a soil conditioner

1128
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,318
one to two percent of total soil volume

1129
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,838
is what it says

1130
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,358
we could use those top dresses which is

1131
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,838
what i did a third

1132
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,039
cup per square foot every two weeks is

1133
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,119
what they recommend

1134
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,559
and then as a soil drink it says use a

1135
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,200
third cup per gallon of

1136
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,159
clean water or nutrient solution and

1137
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:52,078
then let it sit for 24 to 48 hours

1138
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,078
stir in a tablespoon per gallon of

1139
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,200
blackstrap molasses that's the food

1140
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,800
source

1141
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,118
and then a strain to use so just some

1142
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,318
couple different ways to to use bokashi

1143
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,079
yeah

1144
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,759
and that's what's so interesting is

1145
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,760
because it's so

1146
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,640
versatile on using it for nutrients

1147
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,960
to feed your plant with to break down

1148
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,239
compost or get a compost pile going so

1149
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,440
you can use a compost

1150
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:22,639
to then feed your plants so it's

1151
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,960
it's really nice it's very beneficial

1152
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,679
a lot of people that's one of them that

1153
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,800
a lot of people

1154
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:31,199
don't know about and kind of overlook

1155
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,720
and a lot of growers are really

1156
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,118
interested in

1157
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,480
like getting these communities these

1158
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,039
fungal communities

1159
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,159
to the plants and that's kind of what

1160
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,318
this bokashi will do

1161
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,159
is help with the bacteria bring these

1162
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,719
fungal communities

1163
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,440
so we went over 10 different amendments

1164
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,239
there

1165
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,440
and you know when i first started

1166
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,199
getting to organics

1167
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,480
one of the things is that it can be

1168
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,159
overwhelming

1169
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,679
right you've got all these we we just

1170
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,679
scratched the surface today we went over

1171
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,759
10 and there's so many more beyond that

1172
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,159
you know kelp meal alfalfa meal insect

1173
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,880
frass uh blood meal i gotta cheat you

1174
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,719
here

1175
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
feather meal biochar so we could go on

1176
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,199
and on we could have a part two if you

1177
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,358
guys want a part two

1178
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,118
there could even be a part three because

1179
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,279
there's really so many because then you

1180
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,960
have the fish and the hydrolyzed fish

1181
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,040
and the fish meal and right there's

1182
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,800
three different ones

1183
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,480
and that's that's what's so interesting

1184
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,240
is

1185
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,760
i literally have a tote full of

1186
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,838
probably 20 different products that i

1187
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,440
use

1188
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:37,920
and everybody's like that's a lot but

1189
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,200
i'm looking at as i don't know what my

1190
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,119
plant needs

1191
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,679
and all of them work differently for my

1192
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,519
plant and the soil biology

1193
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:50,639
and that's all i can do as

1194
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,800
a home cultivator as growing my own

1195
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,519
fruits and vegetables is try to give the

1196
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,200
plants

1197
00:43:53,519 --> 00:44:00,639
everything available that they can use

1198
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:02,000
for nutrient uptake or nutrients in any

1199
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,519
form that i can find

1200
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,318
that's dry and organic

1201
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,920
because i don't like bottle nutrients i

1202
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:11,440
prefer not to use them they have shelf

1203
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,119
lives

1204
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,880
most of these dry organic components

1205
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,200
don't really have a shelf life

1206
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,640
they're good until they get decomposed

1207
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,519
or broken down

1208
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,000
so that's why i really enjoy using like

1209
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,079
the down

1210
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,358
to earth amendments because they're one

1211
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,880
of them that's

1212
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,960
pretty consistent of their product

1213
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,640
and where i can find them as versus some

1214
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,480
of these other companies

1215
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,159
and their box is environmentally

1216
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,559
friendly right it breaks down breaks

1217
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,159
down

1218
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:43,759
even says compost on the back of it

1219
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,838
use the box for compost yes so i have a

1220
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,599
big compost pile that i have all kinds

1221
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,759
of boxes that i've thrown in

1222
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,599
from making all these different soil

1223
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,640
amendments over the last couple years

1224
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,079
and it's

1225
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,400
they break down pretty quickly

1226
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,800
surprisingly so all that being said

1227
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
what advice do you have for somebody who

1228
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,119
is probably new

1229
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,880
just getting their feet wet with

1230
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,599
organics and stuff what advice would you

1231
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,760
have for them

1232
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,640
keep it simple so the kiss method

1233
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,040
look for a couple things that you want

1234
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,039
to try

1235
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:21,760
i would recommend like some bio live

1236
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,519
one of those lines maybe

1237
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,040
you know a little bit of rock phosphate

1238
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,838
for the trace nutrients

1239
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,519
either some gypsum or some dolomite lime

1240
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,199
just for the calcium magnesium

1241
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,960
sulfur to um um

1242
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,118
and here's what's so nice about some of

1243
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,920
this down the earth some of it's pretty

1244
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,760
inexpensive and it's starting to get a

1245
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,559
little bit more expensive

1246
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,359
boxes i can find gypsum for just about

1247
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,719
six bucks

1248
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,679
but some of these other amendments are

1249
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,919
around twenty bucks for a five pound box

1250
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:56,000
um you can get them in thirty forty

1251
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,760
pound fifty pound bags if you want a

1252
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,119
larger quantity

1253
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,760
but to me it's still really

1254
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,480
inexpensive where i can go get three or

1255
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,000
four

1256
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,079
items just to get started and

1257
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,199
mix them in a soil mix or make a tea

1258
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,920
with them

1259
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,838
and even do a foliar application with

1260
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,680
the solubility of some of this

1261
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,920
that's another application that you can

1262
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,679
do on a lot of this

1263
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,159
so taking you know as a newbie

1264
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,598
keeping it simple i can grab a couple

1265
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,759
boxes

1266
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,119
of a couple ingredients that have some

1267
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,079
beneficial

1268
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,358
biology and some good nutrients and

1269
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,560
start with that

1270
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,239
i think that's really good advice that's

1271
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,519
one way to not get overwhelmed with

1272
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,399
everything that's going on is just start

1273
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,920
with one

1274
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,079
yeah and get another one and kind of do

1275
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,680
your individual research and apply it

1276
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,839
as you feel best that you've done your

1277
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,118
research on and and go from there so i

1278
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,039
think that's great great advice

1279
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,039
and that's like me i've worked over the

1280
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,920
years where i have

1281
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,358
20 boxes i don't use them all at one

1282
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,400
time

1283
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:03,358
because things change during my cycles

1284
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,079
of what i'm feeding them but that's the

1285
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,759
whole point

1286
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,720
is i have what i need available

1287
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,200
for my plants and it takes time to build

1288
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,879
it

1289
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,480
because it didn't just happen overnight

1290
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,800
i don't

1291
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,920
the whole product line if you had to go

1292
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,599
out and purchase

1293
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,039
the down to earth whole product line you

1294
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,838
would probably spend fifteen hundred

1295
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:27,279
dollars to two thousand dollars

1296
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:29,039
that's expensive can't

1297
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,640
not everybody can afford to do that so

1298
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,159
that's where

1299
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,199
a box here a box there and you're only

1300
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,440
putting

1301
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,960
a couple tablespoons here a couple

1302
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,920
tablespoons there

1303
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,800
it's going to last you a while most of

1304
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,440
my boxes

1305
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,160
unless i literally have to make a whole

1306
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,838
new

1307
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,480
super soil recipe i

1308
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,239
don't use my it may take me six months

1309
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,280
to get through my box or longer

1310
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,919
it may take me a year on some of them

1311
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,319
the only time i use a large dose of the

1312
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,159
dryer granule commitments is when i

1313
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:10,480
make a large tea or do super soil

1314
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:12,318
amending and that's it bottled nutrients

1315
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,159
we talked about that shelf life you go

1316
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,239
buy a bottle that's got to be used by

1317
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,480
x amount of time and if it's not it's no

1318
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,479
good

1319
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,760
i can sit around for a year and i'll be

1320
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:24,639
good

1321
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,160
definitely a big benefit there for sure

1322
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,558
all right so how can the listeners find

1323
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,838
you

1324
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,760
and what do you got upcoming in the

1325
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,960
future well um

1326
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,319
we've got quite a bit going on um

1327
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,039
we'll start off you can find me on

1328
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,119
youtube medically fit

1329
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,119
about 18 000 people following me now

1330
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,318
it's been a slow progression on

1331
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,039
educating people um on the channel

1332
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,400
um i've got a lot of great playlists on

1333
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,239
the soil amendments

1334
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
where i kind of talk a little bit more

1335
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,118
on some of them on there

1336
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
as well as you can find me on instagram

1337

best place i talk to people and chat

1341
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,078
with people it's on instagram

1342
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,318
it's easier for me to find messages

1343
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,720
there than it is through youtube or

1344
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,679
anything else so ah you might want to

1345
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,078
take that back

1346
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,519
because you're gonna get flooded you're

1347
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,318
gonna get flooded with questions i'm

1348
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,199
sure that's

1349
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,119
okay because i try to answer most

1350
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,399
people's questions and help most people

1351
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,280
out that i can

1352
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,559
um it may take me a while to see because

1353
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,680
instagram if

1354
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,920
we're not following each other i have to

1355
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,759
allow their request to come through and

1356
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,519
so sometimes it takes me a while to see

1357
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,880
some of my messages but

1358
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,880
i usually try to help quite a bit of

1359
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,000
people out that want a little bit more

1360
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,680
information

1361

1362
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,358

1363
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,760
that's what the channel is really for is

1364
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,960
to try to point people in the direction

1365
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,040

1387
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,358
these different videos i've found

1388
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:35,358
and watched over the years and just to

1389
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,799
have somewhere people can go and find

1390
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,799

1391
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,480
if somebody asks i can try to go to one

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,119
plants you can is to do it yourself

1405

finding what works for you it works

1406
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,920
different for everybody else

1407
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,118
not everybody you know like you have

1408
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,000
soil growers

1409
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,680
hydro growers aquaponic growers

1410
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,280
everybody has their niche find what

1411
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,799
works for you

1412
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,200
don't be afraid to try something

1413
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,720
different either because like you

1414
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,358
it took you a little while and a little

1415
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,519
pushing to try some organics and

1416
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,199

1417
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,960
a while and i even sent you some of

1418
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,118

1419
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,480

1422
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,880
you pushing me

1423
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,679
to wean my way off the bottles you know

1424
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,079
and

1425
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,000
it just takes people sharing the right

1426
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,200
information

1427
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,880
and people willing to listen because you

1428
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,318
can lead a horse of water but you can't

1429
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,480
make him drink

1430
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,558
i can provide all the information to my

1431
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,760
listeners but i can't force them to read

1432
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
it or watch it

1433
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,280
