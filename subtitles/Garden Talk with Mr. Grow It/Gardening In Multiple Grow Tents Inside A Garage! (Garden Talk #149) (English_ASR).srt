61
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,639
asking today we're going to talk all

62
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,039
about growing plants in a garage and I

63
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,759
feel like this is something that a

64
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,039
decent amount of people do grow in a

65
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,598
garage cuz they can't within their house

66
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,120
for whatever reason right maybe they

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,159
don't have space in their house or

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,319
whatever but it's really a topic that we

69
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,680
haven't gotten into much in any of these

70
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,000
podcast episodes growing in a garage

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
really comes with his own unique set of

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
challenges which we're going to get into

73
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,479
I feel like even if you don't grow in a

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,840
garage there will still be some

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,119
takeaways in this episode so don't go

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,039
anywhere if if you see the topic and and

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,319
want to run here but first can you tell

78
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,560
us a little bit about yourself and how

79
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,439
you got into gardening sure so like you

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,158
said my name's Paul um mid-40s guy out

81
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,239
here in Southern California Los Angeles

82
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,318
I'm in the Valley I've been married for

83
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,000
20 years actually my uh anniversary was

84
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,560
2 weeks ago so congrats to my wife she

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,439
stuck around

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,920
um four kids and I've uh I've been a

87
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,598
garage grower for the past you know four

88
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,000
plus years uh grew up a farmers's kid so

89
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,079
uh spent a lot of time in the fields

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,799
when I was uh young up towards you know

91
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,159
early adult but uh my my father had a

92
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,719
Vineyard and an almond farm so spent a

93
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,079
lot of time out in the field so kind of

94
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,598
was introduced to farming gardening at a

95
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
young age and you know a lot of that

96
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,158
kind of translated into you know kind of

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,319
what you see behind me is the garage

98
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,759
grow awesome and then another question I

99
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,318
like to ask in the beginning is what's

100
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,798
your gross style I mean I know you're

101
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,919
indoors in a garage are you in soil

102
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,879
cocoa Hydroponics are you using organic

103
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,639
or synthetic inputs what's your style so

104
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,199
like you know I I have a grow tent I

105
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,639
have well I have three grow tents in the

106
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,119
garage um I'm from a farmer's kid so I

107
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,639
kind of reverted to soil it's what I'm

108
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,840
comfortable with um and I guess it's the

109
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,798
common phrase these days is Sanic so I I

110
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,799
I like to give you know the plants uh

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,120
synthetic nutrients but I also like to

112
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,560
add you know worm castings and I also

113
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,759
like to you know feed in molasses from

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,598
time to time kind of help the root zone

115
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,039
so uh I guess that's what you would kind

116
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:16,199
of call singad in and we'll get deeper

117
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,918
into nutrients how you use them what you

118
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,560
use throughout the whole grow cycle

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,478
later on in the episode first I do want

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
to dive into you explaining your garden

121
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,680
setup that's in your garage now you

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
already mentioned you have three grow

123
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,800
tents in there what do you have for like

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
lighting and how do you do ventilation

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,600
and so on so forth explain your grow

126
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:40,879
setup so this one to my side this way

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,520
this is a AC Infinity 3x3 um I got the

128
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,759
complete setup with the uh with the

129
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:49,399
controller which you know it's hands

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,319
down it's fantastic I mean it it kind of

131
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,239
I don't want to use the word boring but

132
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,120
it really helps regulate so much of the

133
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,400
environment that it kind of it becomes

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,680
almost hands off uh this one behind me

135
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,519
is a competitor I'm not going to name

136
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,720
any names but uh some point I want to

137
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,478
upgrade I'm just you know the light is

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,600
pretty good but the I'm I've really

139
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,959
never been a fan of their their tents

140
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,280
you know truthfully in their customer

141
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,879
service they one time they told me to

142
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,239
sew something um on a defect and I was

143
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,079
just kind of shocked but uh thankfully

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
AC Infinity is not like that and then

145
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,839
I've got one over here on the side

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,079
that's a bit of a reject uh tent I kind

147
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,839
of you know picked up as something I

148
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,079
needed but you know the light in there I

149
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,519
have it's the uh green Sunshine company

150
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,918
the electric sky 180 V3 which I still

151
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,439
love that light you know what I I mean

152
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,599
it I think it works great so it's it's

153
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
hard to part ways with that one so I

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,800
might upgrade the tent and the and the

155
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:41,560
ventilation but I just I I still want to

156
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,160
use that light um you know ventilation

157
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,839
I've got you know I've got fans inside

158
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,600
there lots of lots of air circulation

159
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,638
and I've got an intake fan for all of

160
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,680
them um as well as an exhaust so lots of

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,120
air circulation um and you know there's

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
there's some things I do to just make

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,600
sure that I keep things clean as well

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
but uh that's the setup I have right now

165
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,439
kind of a variety of companies when it

166
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,120
comes to the other uh the last one the

167
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,399
one behind me is it's all competitor

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,240
stuff you got three different tent there

169
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,598
are you doing like Perpetual grow is

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,319
that why you have three different tents

171
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,279
or is it just so you can grow a certain

172
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,680
number of plants or what's the reason

173
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,478
for the three different tents oh you're

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,918
exactly right I'm a Perpetual grower I

175
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,000
kind of have you know different plants

176
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,519
and different life cycles just so I you

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,439
know so there's always a surplus but um

178
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,000
just to kind of keep things going plus I

179
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,000
like to play it's you know having you

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,800
know the right amount of plants in one

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,160
tent or something like that is

182
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,598
just gardening is fun right so you want

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
to play games you want to try different

184
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:42,680
things and you want to kind of enjoy

185
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,038
yourself and so if it's just all inone

186
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,759
it kind of makes it a little bit boring

187
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,959
so I kind of like to you know want the

188
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,759
Perpetual grow but also kind of

189
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,038
diversify and just kind of you know do

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,400
different things at different times with

191
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,000
different plants so now are you on like

192
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,318
a strict schedule for your Perpetual to

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
where like okay I'm going to do this

194
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,680
number of weeks in veg then I'm going to

195
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
flip that the flower and then so you've

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
got everything kind of rotating evenly

197
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,279
or you just kind of like wing

198
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,959
it you know

199
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,439
I my jars are full

200
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,598
so to Simply put it you know what I mean

201
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,959
like I I've got plenty so I you know

202
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,560
like right now you know the 3X3 has it

203
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,279
has one one plant in it and it's in a

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,038
Solo Cup it's the global grow cup so I

205
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,918
devoted you know that entire plant and

206
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,240
that entire setup to that bonsai tree of

207
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,639
a plant that's sitting in there right

208
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,598
now you know what I mean and you know

209
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,918
this one's got a a good amount of clones

210
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,000
and then the one over there in the

211
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,758
corner has a it's a Gary pton that's

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,800
kind of later stages of flowering so

213
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
it's it's in a scr so it takes up the

214
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,840
entire tent you know what I mean so it's

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,360
a variety you know I

216
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,038
play understood so in your grow tents

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
where your plants are growing what

218
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,000
environment conditions do you typically

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,519
aim for so I guess with that I mean

220
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
you've got your Optimum you know I I my

221
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,279
Bas is typically I go off of VPD you

222
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
know and and not strictly but you kind

223
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,279
of you know once you kind of get an

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
understanding of the variations that

225
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,559
you're looking for you kind of need to

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,478
you know where your your the relative

227
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,399
humidity needs to be in contrast to you

228
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,158
know the heat in the uh well I'm in

229
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,359
SoCal so the heat typically in the in

230
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:21,158
the tents right um but you know there's

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,080
Optimum conditions and I think there's

232
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:24,839
realistic conditions and then there's

233
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,399
getting by conditions I mean you know

234
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,198
actually when we met when you were here

235
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,839
in Southern California that couple weeks

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,918
was you

237
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,918
know horrible simply put the weather was

238
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,120
just horrible I mean it was you know I'm

239
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,240
in my I'm in my garage and it's 1: p.m.

240
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,839
and it's like 95° outside and you're

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
just thinking like oh my gosh but I mean

242
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,680
at the end of the day the plants are

243
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,639
really resilient you know what I mean

244
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,319
they can handle a lot sometimes you open

245
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,720
the

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
tent and it's hot in there and the

247
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,160
humidity is low and the plants are

248
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,518
praying you know what I mean they're

249
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,719
just loving life and you're like okay

250
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,839
you know what I mean you tough little

251
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,519
critters you know what I mean so you

252
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,519
guys are doing pretty good but you know

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,320
I I like to be you know again I base off

254
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,560
of VPD you know what I mean I think one

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,680
of the important things is just to make

256
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,039
sure you've got a good functioning

257
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,559
humidifier you know what I mean just so

258
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,799
you're kind of always keeping that up

259
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,879
because in my experience is when it's

260
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,078
really hot if you can increase the

261
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,838
humidity it it decreases the general

262
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,958
temperature and the environment right so

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,800
um I think you know that's really

264
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,759
helpful and actually one of the ideas

265
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,439
that I had send AC Infinity because I I

266
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,519
I do the entire grow in in the tent

267
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,720
right I do the you know from seedling

268
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,039
all the way I use a I use a dome for the

269
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,680
seedling but you know when they're

270
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,958
little dinks to where I'm harvesting and

271
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,159
cutting down it's all in the grow tent

272
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,199
right so you know one of the one of the

273
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,240
you know the uh wish list items that I

274
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,120
had send AC Infinity was hey it would be

275
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,639
great if on the automation there was a

276
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,759
Notifier that you know when your

277
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,919
humidity is low the water in the

278
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,600
humidifier is low so you tells you hey

279
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,879
go fill it up again you know what I mean

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,159
because you never want to run out if

281
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,240
you're if you're drying or something

282
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,199
like that you in in a dry environment

283
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,320
you don't want to run out of you know

284
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,440
water in the humidifier right so I think

285
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,240
it's important I have another one

286
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,800
that'll tell me when it's when it's

287
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,759
empty but that's typically too late so a

288
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,919
warning sign would be uh magnificent but

289
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,399
that's the environment I'm typically

290
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,559
looking for you know it's during the

291
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,799
colder months it's usually you know 50s

292
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,719
to 70s in the garage hotter months it

293
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:27,519
could be 70s to 90s in the garage so you

294
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,920
know typically in the tent it's a little

295
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
bit cooler and then I've got some

296
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,759
you know some things that I use you know

297
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
such as what's really important to me is

298
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,120
an external AC unit that actually also

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,799
has a humid a dehumidifier in it um as a

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,320
means of being able to push in colder

301
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,879
air when I need to and I you know I have

302
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,760
a method of doing that as well but it's

303
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,879
important to me I think we'll talk about

304
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,879
it later but I mean if you're going to

305
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,240
invest and you're in a warm climate

306
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,639
something you need especially if you're

307
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,839
going in the garage you need to be able

308
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,600
to combat the Heat and so you mentioned

309
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,519
you trace you track after VPD do you

310
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
happen to know like for kPa do you

311
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,320
measure by that do you use that and do

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,559
you kind of have it in mind like okay

313
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,519
for this stage of growth I'm going to

314
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,838
aim for this kPa veg flower and so on so

315
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,519
forth you have those numbers so you're

316
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,399
just looking at a chart I use you know

317
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,078
there's some convenient things that I

318
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,039
use you know there's an app on my phone

319
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,679
it's like Dr Greenhouse I believe it's

320
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:23,278
called Uh VPD calculator so basically

321
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,599
you punch in you know the the the uh the

322
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,759
temperature and then you also punch in

323
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,440
the relative humidity and it kind of

324
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,278
tells you where you are um as far as you

325
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,320
know if it's if it's it's either humid

326
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,879
if it'll tell you if it's dry stress or

327
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,680
it'll tell you if it's in you know in

328
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,480
Optimum flowering uh conditions or if

329
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,759
it's in Optimum vegetative condition so

330
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,639
you kind of get used to it so you know

331
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,399
think T typically it's like a 15 Point

332
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,039
difference between the temperature and

333
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,879
the humidity for uh for flour and then

334
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,240
for uh for veg is typically about like8

335
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,200
you know what I mean so if it's if it's

336
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,560
80° in the 10 you're probably looking at

337
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
like 72% relative humidity and that'll

338
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,759
kind of put you in a good spot with for

339
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,759
veg you know what I mean so I'm no Pro

340
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,600
and I'm no scientist I kind of go off of

341
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,759
you know experience I guess you kind of

342
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,278
know what temperature if it's at this

343
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,078
temperature I should probably be at this

344
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,679
humidity you know what I mean so and

345
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,679
then at the same time you you you have

346
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,879
built-in trust with the the uh

347
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,679
Automation and controls you know so

348
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,600
they're doing their job too which is

349
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,078
really

350
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,759
convenient got it yeah and when I'm in

351
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,439
seeding and veg I'm usually aiming for

352
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,919
like a point 8 to 1.1 kPa and then for

353
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,639
flower is like typically about 1.2 to

354
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:41,319
1.5 sometimes upwards of 1.6 kPa but

355
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:44,278
according to the pulse VPD charts that's

356
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,760
kind of the optimal range and then you

357
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,720
know a lot of people think that they

358
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,399
need to just be in that range and that's

359
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,440
it they have to if they're outside of it

360
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,720
they're screwed which really isn't the

361
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,360
case right like the plants will still

362
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,278
grow it just might not be that optimal

363
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,079
growth according to to VPD but I toally

364
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,519
get what you mean by like having the

365
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,719
experience and knowing okay I'm at 82 de

366
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,039
F I know I need to be between this and

367
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
this percent relative humidity you kind

368
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,120
of get that feeling and and most people

369
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,759
that are just using temperature and

370
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,839
humidity a lot of people really are

371
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,759
falling within that optimal VPD range

372
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,040
without even knowing it so so yeah I

373
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,480
just figured throw that one out there

374
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,559
well at the same time you see plants

375
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,600
outside you know you have plants outside

376
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,039
and it's 110 degrees outside and the

377
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,519
relative humidity is 27 degrees or

378
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,399
percent I should say and the plants are

379
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,759
all doing just fine you know what I mean

380
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
so it's like again there's Optimum

381
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,159
conditions and there's realistic you

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,759
know I really try to fall into the

383
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,198
realistic sometimes you just can't get

384
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,278
there you know what I mean it's if it's

385
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,519
just too hot out or if it's you know if

386
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,159
it's just too cool it's too dry you can

387
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:51,600
combat that with with the humidifier but

388
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,958
um again like you said most people just

389
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,240
it it falls within the range of

390
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,638
acceptable right the plant's going to be

391
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,799
it's dealing with it and sometimes you

392
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,879
kind of think maybe the stress is itself

393
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,278
in the with its uh with its triome

394
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,838
production and some of that stuff too

395
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,759
you know what I mean instead of it being

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,720
a perfect lifestyle for them good point

397
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,800
so that's inside your grow tent now how

398
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,720
about your lung room or really the room

399
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,879
that your grow tents are in which is

400
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,079
your garage are you aiming for a certain

401
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,639
temperature and humidity in your garage

402
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,519
so that way any air coming into your

403
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:26,519
grow tents are of the proper Temp and Rh

404
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,078
or or what you know that's a great qu it

405
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,039
this is my my lung room is my man cave

406
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:33,559
you know what I mean so behind me is my

407
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,278
kind of my grow area over here to my

408
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,638
side is you know kind of a bench with a

409
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,799
laptop you know my my whole you know I

410
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,839
when I'm working from home that's where

411
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,679
I'm working and in front of me is my TV

412
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,240
so when I'm watching you guys on your

413
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,879
podast when you know you on your podcast

414
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,120
with some of these other guys it's all

415
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,320
right here so typically my garage is

416
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,600
open and I'm hanging out in here and I'm

417
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,040
and I'm you know again I'm in SoCal so

418
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,399
typically the weather's pretty nice

419
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,719
you've got your hot time and you've got

420
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,440
your cool time but we don't get the Four

421
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,160
Season like some of these other places

422
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,959
where where people are growing so it's

423
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,519
often times tolerable if it's too hot

424
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,638
out the garage is closed and I'm hanging

425
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,560
out inside a closed garage if it's just

426
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,680
right you know the garage is open and

427
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,958
you know again there's a couple things

428
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,479
that I do you know whether it's you know

429
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,399
using the external AC unit if I need to

430
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,278
to help push in cold air if it's really

431
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,480
hot out you know what I mean even if the

432
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,000
garage is closed and it's still hot out

433
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,560
I you know I'll hook up ducting from the

434
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,159
AC unit

435
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,119
straight from the AC unit to where you

436
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,360
know it kind of opens up like this I'll

437
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
shove the ducting and I'll shove it in

438
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,318
there and I'll tape it on there so it

439
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,039
doesn't fall out and then I'll run that

440
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:44,399
duct hose straight into the intake fan

441
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,120
of my uh of the grow tent so it's just

442
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,679
pushing coold there right into there

443
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,879
right so just have to make sure the

444
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,039
filter on your external AC units always

445
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,159
clean uh so it's pushing you know

446
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,879
cleaner air but I mean if if you're

447
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,519
looking for a way to decrease the you

448
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,318
know the internal temperature of your

449
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,799
grow versus outside by up to 15 20° I

450
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,759
you you're just pushing in cold air you

451
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,039
know I'm fortunate my garage actually

452
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,039
has a spot that's got a external like a

453
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,120
kind of a ex like a where air can

454
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,198
exhaust so I've actually taped the

455
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,759
exhaust from the AC unit straight there

456
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,078
so it's pushing all that hot air right

457
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
out of my garage so I can run the AC

458
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,278
unit with my garage Clos and it's

459
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,919
ventilating the hot air out and it's

460
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,078
pushing the cool air right into my tent

461
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,360
so it's really helpful I you know

462
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,039
depending on the climate you're at you

463
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,199
know you're in Vegas if for any of the

464
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,159
people out in Vegas going in their

465
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,240
garage you need an AC unit in there you

466
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,838
know or else it's it gets it gets hot in

467
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
there it's becomes a scorcher you know

468
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,560
so you got to have something the plants

469
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,399
will be happy but come on you know make

470
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,078
their lives a little bit easier right so

471
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,958
that's my lung room yeah I have a couple

472
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,439
buddies who grow in the garage I'm based

473
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:57,159
in Las Vegas the desert and uh

474
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,040
summertime it's from June July August

475
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,399
just about every day is over 100 degrees

476
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,519
Fahrenheit which uh I did the conversion

477
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,240
here because I didn't want to leave out

478
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:09,359
the folks that's using Celsius but over

479
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,959
37° celsus and uh that's pretty hot here

480
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,479
and sometimes it reaches up to 110

481
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,439
degrees Fahrenheit yeah and my buddies

482
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,160
are growing in the garage out here they

483
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,038
have like you said they have an air

484
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,400
conditioner literally right in their

485
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,679
garage and so they're cooling that air

486
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,199
now on the flip side when you're in the

487
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,280
winter time it gets very cold so they

488
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,160
actually have to heat the place do you

489
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,759
have to use a heater at all in the

490
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,080
winter time to kind of heat up your

491
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:38,160
garage so the grow space inside your

492
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,839
grow tents for example doesn't get too

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,960
cold yeah you you know I I get inventive

494
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,720
you know with the AC unit you know I

495
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,720
I'll shove because I've got the 310 I'll

496
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,798
shove three duct hoses in kind of in the

497
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,839
line like this and it's just running to

498
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,319
all three t0 simultaneously which is

499
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,000
pretty cool so it's a three in one and

500
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
for you know I've got like a floor like

501
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,279
a space heater you know those you know

502
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:04,279
just $50 space heater and um I've

503
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,119
actually encl I've got I grabbed a tote

504
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,639
and I and I kind of enclosed it in the

505
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,519
tote standing vertically and I ran the

506
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,480
three duct hoses in there kind of

507
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,879
trapping the heat in that area as best

508
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,038
as I could so the intake fan was just

509
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,720
sucking in warm air from there and um

510
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,000
you know that proved to be successful as

511
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,038
well cuz you're you know again if you

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
you know if you've got multiple tents

513
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,038
andless you want to buy three space

514
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,159
heaters and throw them each one in the

515
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,798
tent which sometimes is too strong and

516
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,679
it gets too warm in there because it's

517
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,879
right on them you know what I mean but

518
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,360
if you're running the intake fan often

519
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,000
times it's got the uh you know the the

520
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,678
the adjuster on it right so if it's

521
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,599
pulling too much or too little you can

522
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,360
adjust that but I've you know I've used

523
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,558
a a big tote that I got from Home Depot

524
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,639
put the you know kind of leaned it

525
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,918
against the uh the space heater against

526
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,159
the wall and then I had the three uh

527
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,360
duct hoses going in there and just

528
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,840
sucking the hot air right from that area

529
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,240
and it helped warm the entire you know I

530
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,359
might be cool where I'm at because I

531
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,319
want the I want the heater on me but my

532
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,199
my tents are thriving with with the

533
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,279
right temperature

534
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,880
so that external that external help in

535
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,000
my opinion is really important if you're

536
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,720
in the garage whether it's that that

537
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
outside AC unit that's going to help

538
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,798
cool the

539
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,200
tents um and also the dehumidifier which

540
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,319
is fantastic when it comes to drying but

541
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,440
um and and also just a quality space

542
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,839
heater that that you could use if you

543
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,038
got one tent you could either kind kind

544
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,319
of Hose it in or whatever I'm not big on

545
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,960
putting the heater right in the tent

546
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,960
depending on how much room you've got

547
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,720
especially if it's going to be right

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,679
next to one of your plants so I kind of

549
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,079
like it to come from the general the

550
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,559
intake fan I'm just a fan of that that's

551
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,439
an interesting way to go about it having

552
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,319
it duck directly into the grow tents the

553
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,679
way that you're you're doing it there's

554
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,439
different ways to go about it right like

555
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
you could just do it passively and just

556
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,120
grab what's coming in from your garage

557
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
for example but uh that might not be as

558
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,279
good as the way that you're doing it now

559
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,759
followup question I have for you is do

560
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:08,158
you also have the rectangle intake vents

561
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:11,158
open as well or you only have the hoses

562
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,880
hooked up to the ventilation socks I

563
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,840
don't have them open I I if if I you

564
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
know if if I don't if the weather's

565
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,000
perfect the intake the fan is just kind

566
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,600
of sitting on top of the tent right um

567
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,480
and one of the things that I do to kind

568
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,639
of you know what I I like to cover it

569
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,038
with panty

570
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,280
hose the uh the intake fan if it's

571
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:35,599
sitting there by itself I'll cover it

572
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,798
with panty hose um as a as a really good

573
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,678
method to kind of filter

574
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:43,200
out stuff and you know um it'll kind of

575
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,159
blow your mind because if you kind of if

576
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
you clean it weekly you you know spack

577
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
it against like you know something

578
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,240
you'll just the amount of Filth that

579
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,119
just bounces out of there is disturbing

580
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,359
but at the same time kind of refreshing

581
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,918
because you're like wow this would have

582
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,798
all gotten sucked right into the grow

583
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,360
tent and just been part of that

584
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,480
environment you know what I mean but um

585
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,798
that's why I was saying clean the filter

586
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,798
on the AC unit if you're going to duct

587
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,119
it that way because you just you're

588
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,960
trying to make sure that anything going

589
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,038
in your tent is guess as filtered as you

590
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,480
can if you're not using you know the uh

591
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,599
like a carbon filter or something like

592
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,038
that as an intake to like kind of bring

593
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,918
in clean air that way but most people

594
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,679
these days kind of use the uh carbon

595
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,000
filter to to kind of kill the smell

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,360
right so it's usually the ex the exhaust

597
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,599
that it's connected to so good tips you

598
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,359
know I know we spent a long time here on

599
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,439
just the environment conditions and how

600
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,879
balance them and stuff like that but I

601
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,278
feel like it's it's kind of an important

602
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,960
thing to talk about when you're growing

603
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,839
in a garage because it's just it's so

604
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,319
different you know it can be so

605
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,480
different or it could be similar to

606
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,359
growing inside of a house but for most

607
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,720
people I feel like it's uh it's got its

608
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,119
own unique challenges when it comes to

609
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,960
environment but let's move on to other

610
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,038
parts of the grow let's get into some

611
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,120
Basics what do you typically use for

612
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,919
like container size and type and and I

613
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,439
think you mentioned you're in soil right

614
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,520
what's in your mix so containers

615
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,278
um well when I'm when they're seedlings

616
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,918
you know actually I kind of like to use

617
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:14,240
Clear Solo cups that I put inside of a

618
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,960
colored Solo Cup um because it you know

619
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,038
it helps you kind of look at the roots

620
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,519
you know you kind of know what's going

621
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,119
on down there and it's it's a really

622
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,158
kind of a cool cheat code um when you're

623
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,319
growing so but I start off in a in a

624
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,559
Solo Cup clear in a colored one and then

625
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,399
if I'm if I'm going straight into the

626
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,359
the final resting place the home that

627
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,278
it's going to be in I'll go into a a

628
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,639
fabric

629
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:38,240
pot um but if I'm going to transfer up

630
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,080
to it I'll I'll go from plastic into and

631
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,640
then the final one is a is a fabric one

632
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,720
just because transplanting is a heck of

633
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,720
a lot easier pulling it out of a plastic

634
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,038
pot versus a uh a fabric one cuz those

635
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,000
roots like to kind of dig into the

636
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,158
fabric ones right so it it could be kind

637
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,679
of chaotic to get them out of there um

638
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:59,080
as far as a

639
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:01,360
mix um soil so I like to use typically

640
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:05,199
my mix is like one3 happy frog from Fox

641
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:07,319
Farms and then you know 2/3 uh ocean

642
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,720
forest and then within that I like to to

643
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:14,240
add uh worm castings you know I used to

644
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,839
add peite but I feel like Fox Farms uh

645
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,120
has enough in there to you know air

646
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,639
rat's just fine I think in my opinion

647
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,719
but I used to add peite but I don't do

648
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,840
that anymore so it's just really it's

649
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,400
one3 Happy Frog two3 ocean forest and uh

650
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,519
some worm castings nice and did you

651
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,400
mention I think I met to what container

652
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,158
size those fabric pots are oh sorry

653
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
container size it varies typically if

654
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,159
you know if I'm kind of doing a simple

655
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,720
like a pheno hunt or something like that

656
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,679
I'll throw them into two you know two

657
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,480
gallon pots just so you know kind of

658
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,120
maximize the room um but typically I

659
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,079
kind of stick to the 3 to five range uh

660
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,639
depending on what I'm you know uh how

661
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,000
big I'm really trying to get them but if

662
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,559
you're in a tent they're going to get so

663
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,839
big you know you don't I don't in my

664
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,079
opinion you don't really need to get

665
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,639
bigger than a 5 gallon pot you know

666
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,278
unless you're trying to grow a monster

667
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,960
in a 5x5 or something like that but you

668
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,720
know I think three three gallons is is

669
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,000
is convenient five gallons is convenient

670
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
I was actually asking myself the other

671
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,839
day I'm like I wonder why they don't

672
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,759
make four gallon CU they make one two

673
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,720
three and five but they don't make four

674
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,720
which could be even convenient too but

675
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,798
uh I'm usually between three and five

676
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,640
there was a four I'd probably buy a four

677
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,158
that's just Diva yeah when s in it

678
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,120
growing I'm mostly the same as you

679
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,640
either a three gallon or five gallon

680
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,599
sometimes I like to just be in the five

681
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,759
because well for mostly just for like

682
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,398
watering purposes if I'm hand watering

683
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,000
you know the 5 gallon is going to need

684
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,000
to be watered a little bit less than the

685
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,079
three gallon for example so that's the

686
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,880
the only reason why I would really

687
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,918
choose a five over a three when I'm

688
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,200
Sanic gardening okay so you mentioned

689
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,759
your mix third Happy Frog two3 ocean

690
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,319
forest and then some worm castings now

691
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,759
eventually those nutrients are going to

692
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,798
deplete and you're going to need to add

693
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,119
in some more nutrition when do you

694
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,240
typically start your first feeding what

695
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,719
does it consist of and then yeah if you

696
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,000
can walk us through kind of the

697
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,038
remaining life cycle and how you do your

698
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
feedings you know

699
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,319
I kind depends on how the plant bigger

700
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,798
when I kind of when I start like if

701
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,720
they're thriving and they're growing

702
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:13,599
probably I don't know you know after

703
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,278
I've transplanted them from like the

704
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:21,519
Solo Cup into a a bigger you know uh

705
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,519
home I guess you can say um say probably

706
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,359
3 weeks something like that you know I

707
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,879
think the nutrients in the soil they

708
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,000
they last a pretty good amount of time

709
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,720
so typically about 3 weeks

710
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,398
two to three weeks I'm not heavy on on

711
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,399
the feeds so I I don't try to kind of

712
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,599
push too much on them and it you know in

713
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:42,599
my past what I give has shown me success

714
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,719
so probably about you know two to three

715
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:48,158
weeks um as far as what I did you ask

716
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,519
what I give what do I use yeah what do

717
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,480
you use for nutrient lineup so I'm a I'm

718
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,720
a kind of a creature of habit so when I

719
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,278
first started you know a lot of the

720
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,079
information I got was from a from a

721
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,759
friend of mine that was growing at home

722
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:00,960
um out in central California

723
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:03,359
more on on a grander scale uh for

724
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,558
businesses and um he introduced me to a

725
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,959
company called veg plus boom Bloom

726
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,319
they're out in San Diego and um you know

727
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,399
they have a part A and A Part B they've

728
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,319
got a foler spray as well as something

729
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,798
they call life which is uh their their

730
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,839
version of the micro rise but I've been

731
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,558
you know I've been using them for for

732
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,759
since I started and you know I I do add

733
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:26,200
some you know some Bloom additives and

734
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,558
such during flower but um you know when

735
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,600
they're seedlings I typically give them

736
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,918
you know RO water with some seaweed

737
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,558
extract um kind of helps I think it

738
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,919
helps the kind of just helps get them

739
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,398
started I think as far as like group

740
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,679
development things like that and then

741
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,678
once I once they're in veg you know

742
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,840
typically if I'm looking at PPM it's

743
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,480
it's right around like the 500 range um

744
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,759
with the uh with the part Aid that I

745
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,278
give um unless I give molasses that

746
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,599
usually help thanks to PPM I think

747
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:58,240
Skyrocket if I'm not mistaken but

748
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,319
uh during veg I just I just give the

749
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,480
part A you know I add I add some cow

750
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,678
here and there like to add silica um you

751
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,038
know I think it helps with uh with just

752
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,919
making the the plant just more sturdy uh

753
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,919
as far as branches and just being able

754
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,960
to you know carry some weight later on

755
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,840
right so I like to add silica and then

756
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,200
once I've kind of gotten into flour you

757
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,240
know you you add you keep everything

758
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,399
that I had before you know I I include

759
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,159
you know U molasses I like to include um

760
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:29,599
you know microorganisms so some

761
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,919
microbial noint inoculant as well to

762
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,959
kind of just make sure that the root

763
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,720
zone is active and you know breaking

764
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,679
down certain things and and giving the

765
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,440
plant the opportunity to uptake the

766
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,759
nutrients that it needs but that's when

767
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,840
I add the uh the flowering part of veg

768
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,558
plus Bloom and then I also um like to

769
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,119
add some uh Bloom boosters um just to

770
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,200
kind of help stack not always convinced

771
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:53,038
that those things are working or the

772
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,360
brands that I'm using are the best when

773
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,240
it comes to that so I'm kind of looking

774
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,678
at again it's tough for me to make

775
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,359
changes when it comes to the nutrient

776
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,120
lines because you know what I've used is

777
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:04,119
shown me success but I don't know if I

778
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,599
can get better right so you kind of have

779
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,599
that in the back of your mind you know

780
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,959
I've got I've got this which was sent to

781
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,278
me and I've got to work that into my

782
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,519
system it's just like I've got this

783
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:14,398
mental block when it comes to switching

784
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,000
up nutrients I'm like come on Paul you

785
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,000
got from the stash man they sent it to

786
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,440
you use the damn thing but I got to I

787
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
got to work it into my regimen you know

788
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,120
what I mean it's just funny how people

789
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,558
become you know I like to experiment on

790
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,319
one end when it comes to like plant

791
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,678
training and things like that but on

792
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,918
when it comes to like the nutrients that

793
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,480
I give I'm just I'm I'm very simple I

794
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,399
mean you know to the point where you

795
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,679
know I don't measure PPM anymore because

796
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,839
I know this is what I give my plants and

797
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,240
I've measured it in the past like like a

798
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,678
rocket scientist you know you're writing

799
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,480
down exactly what you're giving and you

800
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,600
know I I used to even measure the PPM

801
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,919
like I I'd add calag and then I'd add

802
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,918
you know that nutrient and then I'd mix

803
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,240
it up and then I check the PPM and then

804
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,080
I'd add the other things and I start

805
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,200
writing everything down and it got to

806
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,839
the point where I was like okay I kind

807
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,519
of know where all this lies at this

808
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,639
point I had two scoops of the nutrient

809
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,759
of the of the part A and then I had one

810
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,640
scoop of the part B and I had 5

811
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,000
milliliters of this and I and and then I

812
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,480
just at some point you know where the

813
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,519
PPM lies right so but that that's kind

814
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,519
of where I'm at you know great white

815
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,359
when I'm doing transplants um always

816
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,640
helpful you know as far as just dumping

817
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,879
it on there on the roots help helps the

818
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,278
development in the transplant so you

819
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,080
don't get any transplant shock so

820
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,079
call it simple but I have my routine I

821
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:36,158
guess yeah I see that bag of stash blend

822
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,759
behind you and I was wondering when you

823
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,080
when you're going to talk about that and

824
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,440
incorporate that into because you'll be

825
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,158
able to uh cut out some of those bottles

826
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
like you mentioned using seaweed and the

827
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,799
microbio inoculant and silica I mean

828
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,960
that's all located in stash blend so

829
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,918
it'd be interested to see if you

830
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,600
incorporate that in and able to cut out

831
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
some bottles and save some money that's

832
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,678
one of the whole reasons why we put

833
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,918
together that blend well you know what

834
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,440
I'm going to do so when we met at at

835
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,120
Grower's Gauntlet you actually gave me a

836
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,000
pack of uh chill out OG so I'm going to

837
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,278
grow those I'm going to grow those and

838
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,679
I'm going to use the stash so I'm going

839
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,798
to I'm going to break myself in and

840
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:14,720
force force it upon me to do what I got

841
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,440
to do to change that habit but um I'll

842
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,360
post updates you'll see them it'll it'll

843
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,720
be uh and I'll use the good old AC

844
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,519
Infinity setup here to make sure that

845
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,480
it's all perfect conditions but I'm

846
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,679
going to I got to I got to break myself

847
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,679
here awesome I'll definitely be keep my

848
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,278
eye up for that one for sure now you

849
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,600
mentioned you're using the veg plus

850
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,278
Bloom I've actually heard about that

851
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,798
company quite a long time ago now do you

852
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,720
follow their feeding chart at a full

853
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,798
dose or some folks will start with like

854
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,440
a half dose for example you know if I

855
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,398
remember correctly they're they're

856
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,240
they're looking for a little bit more

857
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:53,319
than what I'm putting in um but I think

858
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,599
I don't need to again I think that you

859
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,519
know when it comes to you know

860
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,638
harvesting medicinal plants you know I

861
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,440
get

862
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:02,678
I get what I'm looking for in them

863
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,399
whether it's the the the flavor the you

864
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:09,360
know the aroma um you know the uh

865
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,398
effects I guess you can say right so I

866
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,278
don't give the full dose again I stick

867
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:17,398
to my what I do and you know and you

868
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,960
know my ppms again I think I think it's

869
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,798
molasses right that when you add that to

870
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,159
your to your uh water it's the the PPM

871
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,638
spikes pretty high I think it was

872
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,200
molasses but my my PPM typically does

873
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:32,558
not exceed like 700 On Any Given feeding

874
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,159
so it's in my opinion pretty medium to

875
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,918
low okay and then I think you mentioned

876
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,960
that AR water is that what we're using

877
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,519
for a water source and then if it is how

878
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,399
do you go about the watering throughout

879
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,558
the grow cycle so I'm fortunate to have

880
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:50,239
an AO um Mach thing built into my my my

881
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:51,960
uh kitchen tap here um but at the same

882
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,558
time sometimes when you're trying to

883
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,000
pour like five gallons from that thing

884
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,158
it's not it doesn't give you what you

885
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,759
need right so um I'll get what I can and

886
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,080
then then my family yells at me because

887
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,038
they can't get new water so and then I I

888
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:07,398
go in hiding but

889
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:10,638
um my tap is not so bad so it kind of

890
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:13,638
runs at like I think 220 to 240 PPM

891
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:16,439
which is reasonable right it's not so

892
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,199
bad so you know I'll I'll use that water

893
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,679
too but you know what I'll typically do

894
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,360
is I'll pull um I'll pour it into like a

895
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,679
big container type thing and I'll let it

896
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,119
sit for you know a good day or so to let

897
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,519
the chlorine and whatever else is in

898
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,918
there and of dissipate and leave um and

899
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,720
then I I you know I use something called

900
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,320
drops of balance which you know maybe we

901
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,759
could talk about later but um it helps

902
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,519
clean the water as well of you know and

903
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,440
it helps it helps in in a variety of

904
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,679
ways but I I I like to water with by

905
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,600
hand so you know whether it's using a

906
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,440
bottle you know what I mean or a hand

907
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,199
pump if it's if it's hard to reach but I

908
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,120
kind of like getting in there it it it

909
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,519
forces you to kind of get get up in the

910
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:00,678
plants and really get a good look at

911
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,159
them and and so I I don't mind you know

912
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,639
and and typically if I'm going to travel

913
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,799
or something like that I I plant my you

914
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:07,558
know you can kind of play games with

915
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,720
your watering cycle so you could push it

916
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,158
one more day so you could then water one

917
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,798
more day later you know in a you know

918
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,000
down the road or whatever and then you

919
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:17,839
know that okay I'm going to be gone for

920
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,519
3 days so if I water them now by the

921
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,959
time I get back they'll be perfect you

922
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,679
know they'll want water again or or

923
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,079
feeding again but they're not going to

924
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,159
dry out you know so I I coordinate

925
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,558
myself on that but um I like hand water

926
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,760
it's it's a good excuse to really kind

927
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,480
of get up in there and see what's going

928
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,960
on you know yeah you mentioned the AO

929
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,159
system under the sink and I have the

930
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,679
same thing and same problem where my

931
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:45,200
fiance is like I used up all the

932
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,559
water and uh what I've done is I have

933
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,120
individual water jugs that I use now so

934
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,879
one gallon jugs and I just fill those up

935
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:54,000
and I have a whole line of them right

936
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,240
outside of my grow Ro I'm stockpiling

937
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,638
water a little bit so I try to avoid

938
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,440
running out of water at the uh at the

939
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:03,278
tap there but uh the RO system for those

940
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,880
that are kind of interested is a little

941
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,159
bit of a misconception people say oh

942
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,398
they're too expensive there are

943
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,800
thousands of dollars for a system which

944
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:14,918
isn't true there are systems that I

945
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,359
think I paid $250 for mine $250 for mine

946
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,440
and it's a one: one so uh the technology

947
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,000
getting a little more efficient here

948
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,119
before it was a 1 to three so for every

949
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,039
one gallon of R water you'd be wasting

950
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,838
three gallons well now with the uh the

951
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:33,320
one I have is 1: one it's called the

952
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:34,440
Apec r o s-100 it's an Essence series

953
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,440
what it's called I just pulled it up

954
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,119
right here for every 1gallon of RL water

955
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,800
you're only wased one gallon of water

956
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,159
and you can take that waste line they

957
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,480
call it you can take that and put it

958
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,480
into your own 5 gallon bucket for

959
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,358
example and use it on something else use

960
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,039
it on your house plants some people use

961
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:54,039
it Outdoors so fig I mention that stuff

962
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:56,239
that uh yeah or water isn't as expensive

963
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:59,279
as some may say it is and it doesn't

964
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,919
waste as much as it used too oh yeah the

965
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,000
efficiency of those things is uh it's

966
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,280
it's gotten much better that's for sure

967
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,199
so exactly when you're looking that's

968
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,920
probably one of the key things you're

969
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,759
looking for is what is the efficiency

970
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,519
right cuz they're all around that 200

971
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,200
plus like right in that range right $2

972
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,880
to $300 these days so it's which one is

973
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,598
the most effective one and and you know

974
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,200
least wasteful I guess right so for sure

975
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,000
and directly relating to water let's get

976
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:29,078
into pH do you monitor the pH at

977
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,280
all yeah that's one thing that I do um

978
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:32,880
religiously you know I I I like to I

979
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,599
like to kind of keep it in in the range

980
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,200
of typically I'd say 6.0 to

981
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,280
6.4 um my sweet spot is typically around

982
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,039
6.2 but I kind of do like them the flu

983
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,560
weight between like you know 6.1 to 6.3

984
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,838
if it's anywhere in that range I'm fine

985
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,239
um you know one thing I want to do more

986
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,559
frequently is is uh check the pH of the

987
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,279
runoff just to kind of see where that

988
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,639
sits um because it you know that's a

989
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,680
it's a pretty good indicator of kind

990
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,078
kind of am I am I you

991
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,679
know you know kind of what is it looking

992
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,880
like there you know what I mean you know

993
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,358
I know what's going in but how's it

994
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,880
looking coming out kind of tells you

995
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,598
what the uh kind of what's what's being

996
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,760
held up in the medium right so it's uh

997
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,400
something that I should be looking at

998
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,359
more more frequently that didn't

999
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,720
probably check in the PPM of my runoff

1000
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,960
too um just to kind of see where that's

1001
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,519
at you know got it and then you

1002
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,639
mentioned that you monitor PPM I know

1003
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:31,000
some people do PPM some people do EC

1004
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:33,799
instead for PPM I caught that you do 500

1005
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,039
PPM for veg what do you typically go up

1006
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,599
to in flowering you know it doesn't

1007
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,199
typically exceed 750 you know some of

1008
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,640
the bloom additives that you know when

1009
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,118
you when you when you include them

1010
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,118
whether it's uh big bud or uh you know

1011
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,559
there's a grow Tech monster Bloom I

1012
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,480
realize the PPM doesn't increase

1013
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,039
significantly when I add those to the uh

1014
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,159
to my nutrients so it doesn't it doesn't

1015
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:58,079
I don't really don't see it get past

1016
00:36:54,159 --> 00:37:00,559
750 so it's you know it's it's not it's

1017
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,240
not too you know back in the you know

1018
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,159
when I first learned from my friend you

1019
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,439
know saying pushing 1,400 PPM on you

1020
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,000
know with certain you know certain

1021
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,079
things and and all the time and I

1022
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,039
realized you know I'm I'm giving half of

1023
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,880
that now and I think the quality of you

1024
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,880
know my finished product is

1025
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,480
significantly better so I mean at the

1026
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,960
end of the day you

1027
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,639
know while while most companies probably

1028
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,039
are being as truthful as they can be but

1029
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,480
they're not going to tell you to use

1030
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,519
this much you know because then the

1031
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,800
product's going to sit down on your

1032
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,000
shelf forever right so they they

1033
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,400
probably want you to kind of get through

1034
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,199
it fairly quickly so they're probably

1035
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,440
telling you what you should use at a

1036
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,279
maximum is their minimum you know what I

1037
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,639
mean like oh yeah this is what you need

1038
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,280
to use because they want you to kind of

1039
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,960
come back but I mean I could be way off

1040
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,040
but what I do know is I give a fraction

1041
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,800
of what they're you know I've been told

1042
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:57,199
to and it comes out just

1043
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,200
fine again plus this you know when

1044
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,598
you're

1045
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,239
if you're transplanting and you're

1046
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,960
putting fresh soil you know you're

1047
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,239
taking this and you're putting into

1048
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,199
something here all this additional soil

1049
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,959
that you've added into your pod is new

1050
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,439
and it's filled with nutrients again so

1051
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,519
you're kind of re-upping what was

1052
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,000
depleted earlier to you know it's right

1053
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,400
back it's right back in in the mix again

1054
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,880
right so you don't in my opinion you

1055
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,800
don't always need to be pushing them so

1056
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,480
hard is that PPM numbers that you're

1057
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,800
giving is that the PPM of the nutrient

1058
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,199
solution going into the soil or is that

1059
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,200
a runoff measurement that's going into

1060
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,399
the soil glad I clarified that because I

1061
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,239
think some people might be thinking that

1062
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,800
was the the runoff number so okay so

1063
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,439
that's the measurement going in yeah

1064
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,079
cool okay I want to switch over now to

1065
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,000
another thing that uh could be more of a

1066
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,800
problem in a garage than it is just

1067
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,318
fully indoor which is pests what do you

1068
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,359
typically do in order to prevent pests

1069
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:57,719
when growing in your garage so there's a

1070
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,519
couple things um you know since since my

1071
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,159
garage is typically open I know that I

1072
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,880
get a fresh dose of dust and stuff

1073
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:05,639
frequently right so you've got to keep

1074
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,318
not only the inside of of the

1075
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,759
environment clean at all times but

1076
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:10,159
you've also got to work on keeping the

1077
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,880
outside of the environment as clean as

1078
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,598
you can too right so I think first and

1079
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,800
foremost is be you know be tidy right

1080
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,400
you're you're spending a lot of time and

1081
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,760
energy into these plants and you don't

1082
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,639
want to be lazy on that end of things so

1083
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,640
you know keep clean um inspect your

1084
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,559
plants frequently as well you know don't

1085
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,679
be too hand hands off really got to look

1086
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,239
close

1087
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,239
because you know for those of you that

1088
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,399
have you know you know Chris I'm sure

1089
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,118
you've had pests in the past but when

1090
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,240
you're looking at your your your flowers

1091
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,400
if you're in flower or even if you're in

1092
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,559
veg you're appreciating the flower and

1093
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,400
you're looking at it but when you know

1094
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,679
you've had pests in the past you don't

1095
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
you you realize your eyes are playing

1096
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,279
games on you now because you're kind of

1097
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,280
looking away from everything and you're

1098
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,960
looking deeper into things cuz you're

1099
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,920
trying to see movement or something that

1100
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,920
you know a bug or something like that

1101
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,639
and it's just annoying right so I I try

1102
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,318
to be as preventative as possible but

1103
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,358
some of the things I do you know I'll

1104
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,358
add sticky

1105
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:08,318
traps you know sometimes I'll hang them

1106
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:09,719
outside of my tent and I'll put them

1107
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,759
inside the tent even when I don't have a

1108
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:15,239
problem because it might be an indicator

1109
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,960
of a problem on the horizon right so um

1110
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,479
you don't need to have an issue to have

1111
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,639
a sticky trap kind of in your tent right

1112
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,079
you want to take pictures you could take

1113
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,440
them out make the P the pictures look

1114
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,960
pretty again but uh think when you're

1115
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,358
not taking any pictures or videotaping

1116
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,119
or something like that leave one in

1117
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:32,639
there what's the what's what's the harm

1118
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,400
right uh you know I mentioned earlier I

1119
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,838
like if if my intake fans aren't being

1120
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,160
ducted with like AC or heater I like to

1121
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,960
put panty hose over them um just on the

1122
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,799
cover um and it really is a fantastic

1123
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,440
way of letting air flow in still but

1124
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,280
really acting as a pretty darn good

1125
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,599
screen to kind of keep that dust and

1126
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,640
different types of sediment or whatever

1127
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,480
it might be um outside of your plan

1128
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:59,118
right so there's you know there's lots

1129
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,440
of proactive measures you can do to make

1130
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,280
sure that you're not getting uh any

1131
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,039
infestation because when it happens it's

1132
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,960
frustrating and then you got to play the

1133
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,199
reactive game you know and and that's

1134
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,159
it's no fun are you doing any like

1135
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:16,039
sprays or anything and like the veg

1136
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:18,239
stage to prevent pests you know I've

1137
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,599
what do people use like uh dish soap and

1138
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,078
water you know I think you know I might

1139
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,240
want to I might want to look into using

1140
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,680
that in the future I do use again you

1141
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,039
know drops of balance you know you can

1142
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,639
use that as a f year spray which which

1143
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,519
helps

1144
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:34,679
um it helps really kind of it's

1145
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,079
preventative in in lots of ways it helps

1146
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,559
prevent plant from like you know

1147
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,079
intaking in insecticides and and things

1148
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,358
like that but you know I don't aside

1149
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,200
from spraying that I haven't really

1150
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,960
sprayed anything unless I've needed to

1151
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,118
you know if I've had an infestation the

1152
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,280
neem oil might come into play if I'm in

1153
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,000
veg um if I'm in flour that's a

1154
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,640
different story you know then uh you got

1155
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,838
different problems then got it now have

1156
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:02,000
you had any major INF ation of any

1157
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,920
pesel thankfully major I wouldn't say no

1158
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,079
you know like I've seen pictures of of

1159
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,760
spider mes and webs and like oh my gosh

1160
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,400
like it's you know it that would be so

1161
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,400
disheartening but you know I've had

1162
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,838
problems with you know white flies uh

1163
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,838
fungus snats thrips

1164
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:22,119
aphids and you know white flies are

1165
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,440
annoying looks like little dust flying

1166
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:25,400
around they're really annoying but

1167
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,800
they're not so hard to handle they

1168
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,000
really are a sucker for the yellow

1169
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,720
sticky traps so um those are really

1170
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,119
helpful for those and fungus snats you

1171
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:39,039
know um aphids and um thrips are much

1172
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:43,440
more annoying you know actually uh this

1173
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:46,480
one right here uh I had noticed some uh

1174
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,760
some damage from thrips recently

1175
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,280
actually so I had to uh and they're in

1176
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,280
it's thankfully they're they're in veg

1177
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,839
so I was able to kind of you know uh I

1178
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,319
haven't seen any lately so thankfully I

1179
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,239
think I i' I've beat them but I you know

1180
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,079
it's kind of a number of steps to take

1181
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,279
that again when you're in Veg it's much

1182
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,079
easier if you're in flour I think you

1183
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,960
know what I've done in the past and you

1184
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,760
know actually what I did with this one

1185
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,039
here uh for starters you

1186
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,720
know uh use NE oil spray them spray them

1187
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,639
with NE oil um not a preferred thing but

1188
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,838
it does help right soak kind of the top

1189
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,358
layer of soil and then I did a lot of

1190
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:25,799
visual killing right so you're just kind

1191
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:26,838
of your eyes are all over your plants

1192
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,160
you see a little bit of movement you

1193
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:33,239
kill them um while I was doing that I

1194
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:35,920
had ordered some ladybugs off of Amazon

1195
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,318
so ladybugs are you know they're you

1196
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,838
know plant Warriors right they help they

1197
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,159
help us they're not they're not evil

1198
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,159
they they're what we want in in our

1199
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,960
Gardens so ordered some from Amazon

1200
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,719
unfortunately you know they showed up

1201
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,599
during that extreme heat wave that we

1202
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:51,399
had so I think half of them were

1203
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,800
unfortunately deceased when I opened up

1204
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,480
the uh the package they came in but I

1205
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,839
let them fly in here and they did their

1206
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,800
thing for you know I'd say a good week

1207
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:03,159
just kind of let them take care of

1208
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
business um and then you know it got to

1209
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:06,000
the point where I pulled each pot out

1210
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,318
and I made sure there was none on there

1211
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,039
and they like to go underneath the

1212
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,318
fabric pot so I knocked them off and put

1213
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,199
them outside and then I uh gave it one

1214
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:18,838
more spray of NE oil and then I used

1215
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:21,279
icious Earth um as a top layer which is

1216
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,119
really great it's also really annoying

1217
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,640
cuz it's such a it's so it could be so

1218
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,318
messy it's just white powder everywhere

1219
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:30,558
right so um I I you know I top layered

1220
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,558
it and just to make sure that if there

1221
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,839
was any uh larvi or you know whatever

1222
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,800
the middle stage of those things are

1223
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,558
called people can't remember but um that

1224
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,079
you know this would help kill them so

1225
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:43,359
you know I was using the ne oil for the

1226
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,920
plant itself see if I can take care of

1227
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,159
whatever was on the plant still if

1228
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,760
anything and then the dious earth I

1229
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:51,480
think helped kill whatever was still in

1230
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,280
the soil um and then afterwards I just

1231
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,400
watered over that and thankfully but now

1232
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,599
it's still little dust particles here

1233
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,880
and there you kind of staring at the

1234
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,880
plants you see little white specks

1235
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,079
you're like what is that and then you

1236
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,760
realize it's just dious Earth you just

1237
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,680
kind of rub it out you know what I mean

1238
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,920
but uh thankfully I've uh I think I've

1239
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,318
rid myself of that problem so it's a

1240
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,079
couple steps you know hopefully your

1241
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,400
users get some information out of that

1242
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,559
you know I know neem oil is a bit

1243
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,039
questionable but you know you try to buy

1244
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,040
the one that's just you know I think

1245
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,599
they sell organic versions or the

1246
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,880
diluted type or something but it it

1247
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,640
ultimately helps you don't want to use

1248
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,480
that during flour though during flour

1249
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,719
probably just want to go the DI to Earth

1250
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,159
on the soil and then let the ladybugs

1251
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,078
have at them and then whatever you see

1252
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,118
with your eyes just kill what you can

1253
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,240
you know if it's something that's not if

1254
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,119
it's a mild infestation if it's heavy

1255
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,358
you probably you might have to just

1256
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,838
scrap it depending on how bad it is

1257
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,279
thanks for explaining that in detail I

1258
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:47,078
know we have quite a few people that

1259
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,800
battle pests and uh you definitely named

1260
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,599
off some some good Solutions there for

1261
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,960
people to try next I want to get into

1262
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,880
misconceptions what would you say are

1263
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,519
some misconceptions about growing in a

1264
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,160
garage you know

1265
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,280
you kind of hear different things from

1266
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,719
different people you know I think that

1267
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,240
when it comes down to it if you can

1268
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,159
control your environment your garage is

1269
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:09,679
as good as a laboratory you know what I

1270
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:12,399
mean if if it makes no difference I

1271
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,598
think that if if you have things dialed

1272
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,119
in right and you've got the right

1273
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,559
genetics you know you can grow

1274
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,280
some high quality flour medicinal flour

1275
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,800
or flowers you know Tomatoes whatever

1276
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,359
you want to call it anything you know

1277
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,599
any vegetables in this environment you

1278
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:29,558
know and and

1279
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,280
I was fortunate enough to be part of a

1280
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,880
kind of an experiment where you know I

1281
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,440
was able to testing is it's expensive

1282
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,640
and even those home testing kits are

1283
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,639
really pricey when it comes to medicinal

1284
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,960
plants but I was fortunate enough to be

1285
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:44,078
part of an experiment where you know

1286
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,480
what I what I grew here right behind me

1287
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,559
was sent to a a lab in professionally

1288
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,400
testing and you know I'm not trying to

1289
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,160
toot my horn here but you know what I

1290
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,119
grew right behind me in in a garage in

1291
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,358
Los Angeles San Fernando Valley uh

1292
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:02,280
tested 30 plus and cannaboids and you

1293
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:05,920
know 28 28.1% thca

1294
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,200
so I was you know I was happy you know

1295
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,599
you kind of become proud you're like all

1296
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,159
right you did pretty good Paul not too

1297
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,280
bad

1298
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:16,440
so I think the the primary misconception

1299
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,119
is this is not like an ouse you know

1300
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,519
what I mean like an outside oh you're

1301
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,519
kind of you know shunned and you got to

1302
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,759
go in your garage like you can make it

1303
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,199
work here you know there's some things

1304
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,559
that you might need to use that a

1305
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,000
traditional that's growing inside a air

1306
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,319
conditioned climate controlled

1307
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,358
environment might not have to or even in

1308
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,800
a bedroom or a bathroom you know but you

1309
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,279
can make it work in the garage that's

1310
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,960
for sure good advice and so we do have a

1311
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,160
lot of beginners that tune into this

1312
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,960
podcast I want to ask you for those

1313
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:47,279
folks that are beginners that are just

1314
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,559
getting started growing in a garage what

1315
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,440
advice do you have for them you know I

1316
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,280
think the community is huge I think

1317
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,200
there's no right way to grow plants

1318
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,280
right plants kind of grow themselves and

1319
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:04,399
you're just kind of helping them along

1320
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,920
the way right so I think you know tuning

1321
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,318
into you know podcast like this one

1322
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,880
right here and then some of the other

1323
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:13,599
people out there like you

1324
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,480

1326
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,480
dark folks you know you learn a lot from

1327
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,000
different people you know I there's a

1328
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,039
number of people you know when I first

1329
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,920
started

1330
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,199
growing you kind of feel like you're on

1331
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,039
your own little little island you know

1332
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,399
that you don't you know your friends

1333
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,920
might not grow so you don't really don't

1334
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,440
have anyone much to talk to and then I

1335
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,680
kind of saw the Instagram community and

1336
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,920
I was like oh what's this you know what

1337
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,039
I mean and I you know started linking

1338
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,639
with people from that from that

1339
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,599
community and then I realized wow

1340
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,318
YouTube has so many cool things um as

1341
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,160
far as like medical going and things

1342
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:47,358
like that and then I found Mr Gro and

1343
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:50,159
then I found people like welcome to the

1344

grow tent and Rose of green and you know

1345
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,318
just a variety of these people and then

1346
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,079
as time grew some of these other people

1347
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:57,279
came in and you just kind of see what

1348
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,920
works for you right you have to kind of

1349
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,200
come up with your own formula you don't

1350
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,000

1352
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,280
these different types of things that

1353
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,519

there's different methods that are going

1357
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,000
to work for everybody and you just have

1358
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,519
to kind of dial in what's going to work

1359
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,318
best for you and um and then go from

1360
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,519
there and then another thing

1361
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:27,759
is you know I know income and money is

1362
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:31,159

1365
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,240

1366
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,639
going economical right you kind of go

1367
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,879
with what works for you but chances are

1368
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,440
if you're going to buy some dinky thing

1369
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,838
off like Alibaba or something like that

1370
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,159
you I can guarantee you're going to

1371
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:47,798
upgrade it because it's not going to get

1372
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,598

00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,279
going to provide you the best

1376
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:57,318
environment because you don't want

1377
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,960
to spend a little bit of money and then

1378
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:03,920
be able to grow something that's okay

1379
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,119
right but if you maybe saved a little

1380
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,159
bit more or whatever and put another1

1381

$150 or whatever it might be into a

1382
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:11,759
something that's got environmental

1383
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:13,119
controls and something that's really

1384
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,960
going to help

1385
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:20,280

1386
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,760

1387
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,000

grown a plant with this huge copper wire

1448

a copper thing that kind of grows with

1452

your plant and apparently the uh the

1453
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,440
energy in the in the air it kind of goes

1454
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,440
through the copper wiring and and it

1455
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,400
