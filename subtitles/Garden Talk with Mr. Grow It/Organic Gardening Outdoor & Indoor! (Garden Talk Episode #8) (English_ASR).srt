1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
if you have your environment dialed and

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,959
you also are dialing in your feed

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,520
ph dc temperature all that stuff is

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,879
dialed

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,558
you can come out with a very nice

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
product it doesn't matter what the line

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,879
they all have

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,558
the same kind of stuff in them just

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
different ratios and that's why they can

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,198
put a different

11
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,879
name on it you can make a serum of

12
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
lactic acid bacteria

13
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,198
and that's inoculate you can use in

14
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,679
water and give to your plants you can

15
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,560
spray

16
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,198
lab on your plant it'll prevent mold and

17
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
then when you

18
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
water it into the soil it breaks things

19
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,600
down readily

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
the aeration i like to use pumice and

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,359
then

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,119
the second best i like to use is a

23
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,119
hydroton clay and then

24
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,718
if i have to i use perlite you can get

25
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,320
it to the point where you just take like

26
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,558
a size of your pinky you just put it in

27
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,359
a 55 gallon drum and you just inoculated

28
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,439
the whole drum

29
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,479
with fungus beneficial fungus and that

30
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
fungus was

31
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,198
captured indigenous in your area right

32
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,198
outside

33
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,280

review

67
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,359
i think on apple podcast i believe we

68
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,798
have two ratings so far so

69
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,640
maybe after this episode we'll have

70
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,399
three i hope before we get into the

71
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,118
video i would like to give a quick shout

72
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,759
out to our sponsor for this episode

73
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,359
our sponsor for today is organic rev the

74
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,718
team at rev sent me a sample of their

75
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,479
organic growth stimulant

76
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,840
and so far my plants love it it's

77
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
certified organic

78
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,759
and consists of a naturally occurring

79
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,239
source of carbon it also consists of

80
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,159
humates and microbes it can safely be

81
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,878
used during all stages of growth

82
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
from seed all the way to harvest it can

83
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,799
increase germination rates

84
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
it can increase root mass it can reduce

85
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
transplant shock

86
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
and it can make nutrients more available

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
that's what i hope to to accomplish in

132
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
this episode is kind of digging down to

133
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,158
that next level of things

134
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,280
you know exactly what you do in your

135
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,199
processes

136
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,479
um you know we all grow a little bit

137
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,479
differently right you have your

138
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,479
methods i have some methods that i do

139
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,000
differently um the people are listening

140
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,679
they all have their individual methods

141
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
and goals and so on and so forth so

142
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
that's what i kind of try to accomplish

143
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,159
within the show or podcast

144
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,199
it's just really talking one-on-one with

145
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,878
growers

146
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,399
finding out what they do in their garden

147
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,479
and then the listeners can

148
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,239
listen in and potentially implement some

149
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,639
of those best practices in their garden

150
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
so

151
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,919
it's been helpful so far and uh

152
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
definitely glad that you're back for a

153
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,719
second

154
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,078
second time around yeah i appreciate it

155
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
too and it's like it's not what we all

156
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,478
do you know we see other people doing

157
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,959
things you know

158
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,918
um right you know but then we we take

159
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,159

171
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,960
their flowers uh real close

172
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,639
and uh you know my dad he would you

173
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,879
would have a vegetable garden every year

174
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,439
as

175
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,319
far back as i can remember i'd admire

176
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,918
you know the way

177
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,599
you would have everything lined up you

178
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,439
know everything would be healthy

179
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
um you know i i would just want to

180
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,759
figure out how to do it myself

181
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
um my grandmother to my nana uh she

182
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,038
would have house plants they would live

183
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,319
for years you know and look beautiful

184
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,478
and i'd wondered

185
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,918
how to do that too and when i got older

186
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,079
i was starting to get

187
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,120
my own skills you know and doing that

188
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,279
stuff nice

189
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,879
yeah my my grandmother actually grows

190
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,159
vegetables too and that's i think that's

191
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,079
one thing that's kind of strengthened

192
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
the bond between me and her is that

193
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,879
we have something to talk about right we

194
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
talk about the vegetables growing and

195
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,360
just growing

196
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,720
so it's really cool yeah and then you

197
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
know you can take it a step further you

198
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,759
guys can enjoy them together

199
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,439
you know you put them at the table you

200
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
know it's not just you get it from a

201
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,160
supermarket you guys can enjoy something

202
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,399
you grew together

203
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
it's great you know i love that and uh

204
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,719
but how i got into growing though you

205
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,038
know like

206
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
you know i just from growing other

207
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,038
things yeah

208
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,038
you know and then i started growing

209
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,319
cannabis at an early age you know

210
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,079
i just was hooked to the growing

211
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,319
candidates um you know i just wanted to

212
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,959
figure out how to make the best flower

213
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,360
for myself primarily you know um because

214
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,638
i

215
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
want to have to rely on other people to

216
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,038
get it simple as that you know so um

217
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,720
you know later on it just honed my

218
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,800
skills in that that way

219
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
cool um so last time we talked you were

220
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
growing 100 organically

221
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
primarily growing outdoors you had

222
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
mentioned that you've grown indoors in

223
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
the past

224
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,159
are you still growing uh organic no-till

225
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
living soil

226
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
outdoors oh yeah for sure you know um

227
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,360
everything i do outdoor

228
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,638
um is all organic um i don't i like to

229
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
be conscious of

230
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
you know uh the ecosystem and what's

231
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,318
going into

232
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
the river or something if i have a lot

233
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
of runoff you know so i like to not use

234
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,918
synthetics i like to just use

235
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,399
soil and water and you know keep it

236
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,198
simple

237
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,399
um just like you know just like nature

238
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
and stuff like that

239
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,318
but indoors um you know i will i will

240
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
use the synthetic indoor yeah

241
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
and i checked your instagram you are

242
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,560
going indoors now i saw some plants in

243
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,560
there

244
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
before we hop deep into the outdoor

245
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,399
organic side which

246
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,478
will primarily be this episode um just

247
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,239
talk a little bit indoors can you just

248
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,519
maybe briefly talk about you know what

249
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
size grow room you're in

250
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,240
indoors how many plants you're running

251
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,719
what you're using for lighting things

252
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,759
like that

253
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,840
yeah so um it varies you know i have a

254
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,879
about an eleven by eleven flower room uh

255
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,758
my veg space

256
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,680
is ten by ten um but i with that veg

257
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,639
space it does a lot more than just uh

258
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
power my my flower room um it you know i

259
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
got out

260
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,318
you know my outdoor locations um i'll

261
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
veg plants up

262
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
you know as big as i can get them coming

263
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
into season and then put them into um

264
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
you know large volumes of organic soil

265
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
and just let them go crazy you know just

266
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
to get what i can

267
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,280
as far as like lighting

268
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,639
in that 11 by 11 flower room i'm using

269
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,598
leds

270
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,280
using the fluent spider two eyes and i

271
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,759
just recently bought some

272
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,279
of the spectre pros i'm just really

273
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
liking the leds you know what they're

274
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,878
giving me

275
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,439
um structure you know flower structure

276
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
and then

277
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,759
my veg space i'm using t5s in the cloner

278
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,079
t5s out of the flowers still under t5s

279
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
and then i move them on to under like a

280
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,560
315 cmh a couple of those

281
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
to uh ready them for the for the flower

282
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,598
room

283
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
um but uh for plants like how many

284
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,759
plants i put into them

285
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
into that flower room it'll vary like um

286
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
since

287
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,478
um you know legal plan counts 12 i like

288
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
to stay at

289
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,560
12 you know nothing over 12 in flower

290
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,439
even though you could fill a canopy with

291
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,000
however many

292
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,680
you know small plants to fill a canopy i

293
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,519
like to just keep it at that legal plant

294
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,439
so like google plant counts so

295
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,560
you know for my four lights like a six

296
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,799
to nine plant

297
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,639
is where i keep it at nice not not too

298
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,718
not too big a pots either i keep them

299
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,158
at most you know six gallons the biggest

300
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
spot to go up to for indoor

301
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,918
i would since that what line are you

302
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
using for synthetics

303
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,759
right now i'm using house and garden um

304
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,480
and uh you know

305
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,039
you could literally use general hydro a

306
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,639
and d

307
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,719
you know and if you have your

308
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,480
environment dialed and you also are

309
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,879
dialing in your feed ph

310
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
you see temperature everything all that

311
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,200
stuff is dialed

312
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
you can come out with a very nice

313
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
product doesn't matter what the line

314
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,199
they all have

315
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
the same kind of stuff in them just

316
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,839
different ratios and that's why they can

317
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,159
put a different

318
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,080
name on it got it so even though you

319
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,759
primarily grow organic

320
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,759
and you know you're all about organics

321
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,799
passionate about that um

322
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,600
you still do utilize synthetic nutrients

323
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,559
yeah i do know for sure i do see a use

324
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
for it indoors

325
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,759
you know like when you're you when

326
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,399
you're in small volumes of soil

327
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,759
and um you know you still want the plant

328
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,200
to be fed and progress

329
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,559
and get bigger um say for mother or um

330
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
whatever production say like i was

331
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,479
saying my my uh

332
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
veg space how it it does more than just

333
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,360
power that power that one 4x4 flower

334
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,359
you know um with synthetics i'm able to

335
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
achieve that you know i can clone

336
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
hundreds of clones however many i take

337
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
off i can have them all rooted ready to

338
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,919
go

339
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
and and then i put them and then outdoor

340
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,000
i can put that

341
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,278
into um an organic medium and then it's

342
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
organic after that it's

343
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,559
it's you know i'm just giving it uh in

344
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
organic inputs

345
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,559
okay so let's flip back to the organic

346
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,320
side of things let's um

347
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,479
let's start from the kind of the very

348
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
beginning with grill pot size

349
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
so you can talk about what grill pot

350
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,958
size you use and what type of grill pot

351
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
to use

352
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,078
i use all all types of pots for indoor

353
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,959
and outdoor indoor

354
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,559
in particularly for synthetics i like to

355
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,278
use plastic just because you can just

356
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,518
pop them out

357
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,720
real easily for transplant um it's clean

358
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
up is really easily

359
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
uh easy i don't like how like if you're

360
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,239
going to use a smart pot

361
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,679
cloth with synthetics you're going to

362
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
have to wash

363
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,039
the synthetic out of the cloth you know

364
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,599
if i'm

365
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,799
with living soil um i like to i like to

366
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
use a breathable pot

367
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,240
um like a smart pot um grassroots fabric

368
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,559
pots

369
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
uh those rain science you know a lot of

370
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,078
different kinds of breathable pots but i

371
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,639
just like when the air uh the

372
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,599
roots can air prune to the sides um and

373
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,799
then also

374
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,759
um it's able to you know breathe more um

375
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,799
and dry out

376
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,679
not stay too wet but for indoors for

377
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,000
living soil uh like if you're gonna do

378
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,239
for

379
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,159
for the pot size for its last pot for it

380
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,278
to flower in i don't go anything less

381
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,679
than 30 gallons

382
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,039
um anything less than 15 gallons i mean

383
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,319
so you should do 15

384
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,519
or nothing less than that basically

385
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
because if you're gonna if you're gonna

386
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
do that you're gonna have to give it a

387
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
synthetic or

388
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,159
supplement with something outdoors

389
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,360
um you know i'll use um 1 to 45 gallons

390
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:29,360
100 to 200 gallons i like to

391
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,399
build trenches and fill them up you know

392
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,039
and do raised beds so for those that

393
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
don't know

394
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,559
maybe you're watching my channel for the

395
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,278
first time i've been growing for

396
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,119
11 years now and i think eight years my

397
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,000
first eight years was just all synthetic

398
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
nutrients three

399
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,159
gallons five gallon grow pots indoors

400
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
basically my entire time i've grown a

401
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,319
couple outdoor plants but

402
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,958
i don't call myself an outdoor grower

403
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
but i've slowly ventured over to the

404
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,638
organic side of the thing so i'm trying

405
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,480
to wean my way off those bottles

406
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,600
and a method that i'm trying is um

407
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
and i've been recommended what i've been

408
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,680
told is seven gallons at the minimum

409
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,599
for um for organics and i keep my plants

410
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,319
very small so that might have to do with

411
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
it as well

412
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
so a technique that i'm going to try

413
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,838
this time around is

414
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
vegging out in one gallon containers

415
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
kind of shaping it the way i want to

416
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
shape it and then

417
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
shortly before flipping to flour go into

418
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,560
that seven gallon

419
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
that's you know heavily amended with the

420
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,799
organic nutrients

421
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,879
that way hopefully it makes it through

422
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,278
most of flour if not the entire flour

423
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,320
right

424
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,838
kind of giving it that last super soil

425
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
right before flipping to flower so i'm

426
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
going to see if that works but

427
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,039
i probably will after listening to you

428
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
and and some other people

429
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,639
you know 15 gallons 30 gallons is

430
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,919
probably yeah

431
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,600
yeah but that's when you know your

432
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,559
timing may be better than mine you know

433
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
my timing isn't

434
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,000
isn't always on point you know so my

435
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,959
roots are definitely bigger than the pot

436
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,639
you know um you know so like i i love to

437
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,159
shape a plant before it gets into that

438
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
medium like i was saying like vegging

439
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,559
plants indoors i can veg them with

440
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,719
synthetics

441
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,319
get them to a big you know big state get

442
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
them into an organic medium

443
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
and then they you know um their vascular

444
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,278
system can can um

445
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
become you know with organic meat uh

446
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,399
nutrients instead of synthetic nutrients

447
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,278
you know and there is a little bit of a

448
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,799
transition

449
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,559
period you know um but like we were

450
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,439
saying though um when you take like a

451
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,039
small

452
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
one gallon or something and then right

453
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,559
as you transplant it

454
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
you flower very shortly after that the

455
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,799
roots are still having gotten into that

456
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
seven gallon

457
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,240
you know it there could very well be

458
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
enough food for the plant

459
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,360
um especially if you do multiple of

460
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,480
those you know

461
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
definitely have the plants at a

462
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,440
manageable size you know that a good

463
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,838
airflow can still

464
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
be achieved um you know it's all about

465
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
timing and stuff

466
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,159
like i'm saying my timing isn't always

467
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,599
on my clones are

468
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
aren't always as healthy as i want them

469
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,278
when i want to put them in flour

470
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
you know or something like that so it's

471
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,159
like i'm usually using a veg plant that

472
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
i have

473
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,198
that's been vegging for a while that i

474
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,160
put in that's got it

475
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,759
okay so what is uh actually in your mix

476
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,838
i do like to use my

477
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,039
make my own soil outdoor because i'm not

478
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
i don't like to buy you know

479
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,958
yards and yards of some company soil it

480
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,198
does cost a lot you know

481
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,479
especially when i have things on hand um

482
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,240
that i could make myself

483
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
um so like i would start with like a

484
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
base soil and you need to just source

485
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
you know good quality earthworm castings

486
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
or compost you get that and

487
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,159
you combine it with cute moss and some

488
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,278
form of aeration

489
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,039
and the aeration i like to use pumice

490
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,958
and then the second best i like to use

491
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,519
is a hydroton clay and then

492
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,039
if i have to i use perlite the reason

493
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
why i don't like using pearlite too much

494
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,879
when you buy it in quantity there's a

495
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,839
lot of dust that i kind of need to

496
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,120
um clean clean out uh you know so i'll

497
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,639
use the top of the bag

498
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,159
and then once i get towards the bottom

499
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,519
i'm you know i'm not like dumping that

500
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,039
the rest of it on there you know i don't

501
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
want to have that dust in it

502
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,639
um but uh yeah so i'll start with that

503
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,159
as a base oil

504
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,159
i'll combine those three things together

505
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,639
on a certain ratio so like what i like

506
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,838
to do

507
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,560
is they um third third third so 33 33 33

508
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
mix

509
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:02,479
um of the compost earthworm casting

510
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,198
peat moss and aeration and once i get

511
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,159
those

512
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,599
um mixed together i have a base soil and

513
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,439
that base oil

514
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
you know depending on the quality of

515
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
your earthworm castings

516
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,639
and your compost can get you through

517
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,560
many weeks of veg

518
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,919
you know give you plenty of vegetative

519
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,039
matter you require for

520
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,278
for flour um and then

521
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,120
so what i do with that base oil is is

522
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,078
make it into super soil you know and i

523
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
had amendments

524
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,078
i uh add amendments to that the one that

525
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,040
i use um and what i've been using for

526
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,439
many years now

527
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,599
um is the claddin's coots recipe and

528
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
it's a little bit of a modified one

529
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,278
which is super simple which is like i'm

530
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,680
saying you start with that base soil

531
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,078
so and then per cubic foot you do this

532
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,120
ratio uh personal per cubic foot we put

533
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,359
a half cup

534
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,679
of mean seed meal a half cup of kelp

535
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,000
meal uh half cup crab meal

536
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,359
and then you put a fourth cup of gypsum

537
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,919
and then another half cup

538
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,079
of oyster shell flour and then two cups

539
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,360
of basalt rock dust and i'll mix

540
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,519
that into uh per cubic foot

541
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,440
and however quantity i need and then

542
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,519
i'll have my super soil after i let it

543
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,519
sit for 60 to 90 days about

544
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
um definitely you know definitely you

545
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,959
don't want to use it before then

546
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,719
because you say sorry did you say 60 to

547
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,039
90 days you let it sit

548
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
that's um especially in quantity you

549
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,480
know if you have a small batch

550
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
you know and like a bin i'm sure you can

551
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,480
get get away with it being

552
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
faster you know um but like when you're

553
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,879
controlling moisture content and you got

554
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
to move

555
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,120
move a big pile i i 60 to 90 days is

556
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,198
just where i

557
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,480
you know before i put my plants until

558
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,639
i'm like comfortable with the plants

559
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,759
there with no problems you know

560
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,799
uh because that mix so that mix that i

561
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
told you is um

562
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,159
is a pretty uh hot mix too you know so

563
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,240
like

564
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,439
if that's that's a no-till mix because

565
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
you'll be able to get

566
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
you know multiple multiple runs out of

567
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,320
it with giving just little top dress

568
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,000
you know um or something like that a

569
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
couple other things i do like to add

570
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,639
into it which makes it a little bit of

571
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,040
the modified one is uh insect fresh

572
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
alfalfa meal and fish meal you know so

573
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,240
i'll i'll use

574
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,919
those sparingly with as much as i have

575
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
whether it be on the bottom of the pot

576
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,038
before i plant or

577
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,399
while it's already established on top

578
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,199
i'll kind of talk through some of that

579
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
stuff on

580
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,519
uh sometimes but um you know as far as

581
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,918
my mix goes you know

582
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,720
you could use in-depth inside you know

583
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,759
um

584
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,240
you know or or just outside um but

585
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,919
outside i would also add more organic

586
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,279
matter whatever organic matter you can

587
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
have that's been sitting around for a

588
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,000
while

589
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,599
whether it be rotting wood maybe at the

590
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,960
bottom of your pot you know it can just

591
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,359
kind of retain water good

592
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,558
and stuff um you know especially for you

593
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,959
know say a huge

594
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,038
uh hubel trench you know which is

595
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,360
utilizing rotting wood

596
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,798
and culturing fungus in that wood

597
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,279
whether it already be in the wood

598
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,359
you know um there so outdoor you know

599
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,960
the mix that i would use it just

600
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,879
as much organic matter as i can get

601
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,319
together to make the volume bigger

602
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
um to to uh for what i need say it be a

603
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,918
large

604
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,240
trench for a hugel you know or or a

605
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,799
large rage bed or something like that

606
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,558
but i also like get bag soil too i'm not

607
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,079
afraid to use uh some companies

608
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:14,480
like stonington from coast to maine

609
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,558
right out of the cloner a lot of uh like

610
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,839
any of my cuts all all the clones that i

611
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,558
have that have been around for a long

612
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,720
time

613
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,319
go solo cup right in the stones and you

614
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,038
know water with water

615
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,000
and just been for like for weeks you can

616
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,720
keep it in that and

617
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,038
they're no with no problems you know um

618
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
and

619
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,879
that's why i like to use some bag soil

620
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,279
another one roots organic 707

621
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
i won't use it inside because um usually

622
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,879
it has bugs but

623
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,919
outside i'll you know if i'm short on

624
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
some quality

625
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,919
soil i need to veg some plants in to get

626
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,919
them bigger early in season i'll go buy

627
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
some roots 707 to get them

628
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,520
into a bigger volume to not be sitting

629
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,480
in the pot they've been in for a while

630
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,038
um uh nectar for the god sunshine for

631
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,919
our view

632
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,679
another good one you know build the soil

633
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,038
i love build the soil they're light mix

634
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
their 3.0 mix

635
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,720
all stuff that i'll use for sure that's

636
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,558
all good living soil bag

637
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,079
you know before when i was when i was

638
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,639
growing up they didn't have these types

639
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,159
of

640
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,400
bag soil you know there there were

641
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
companies that were that were doing this

642
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,759
type of stuff

643
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,479
got it let's talk about water which type

644
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,679
of water

645
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,038
do you use for your plants ro tap

646
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,720
distilled what makes most sense for my

647
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,599
location and situation always use our

648
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,839
water

649
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,918
probably for um with when i use

650
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,000
synthetics you know i like the idea

651
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,000
i like the idea of just starting with

652
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
just straight water you know nothing in

653
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
it

654
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
and then me being in control of what i

655
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
put in it and then what the plants

656
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,839
get you know so um you're completely

657
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
scared in the ship

658
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,359
you know when i think about synthetics

659
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,320
um when i

660
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,798
i use pre-filtered well water um at

661
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,839
locations i'm growing organic you know

662
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,759
so while water's got minerals in it um

663
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,038
from where you're at that you'll you'd

664
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,759
be adding to the

665
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,640
adding to the soil or the water already

666
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,558
so it's just

667
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,480
you don't have to um take it out other

668
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,519
other than like when i say pre-filter

669
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
iron you know so i'll i'll have a

670
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,558
pre-pre-iron filter before

671
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
um i give that to my plants because you

672
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,319
could definitely give too much iron to

673
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
your

674
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,519
your plants in water especially when you

675
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,798
can see it when it's like brown and

676
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,119
brownish from a couple

677
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,319
a couple uh spots that one tap water all

678
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,479
right so like say

679
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,000
uh it's from a town i i don't like to

680
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,279
use that at all just because

681
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,720
unless it's um pre-filtered pre chlorine

682
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,240
filter so de-chlorinated

683
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,400
because i just don't like the idea of

684
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
having chlorine um

685
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,759
um and especially with organics because

686
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,840
it could

687
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,200
you could destroy you know

688
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,240
microorganisms

689
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
uh so you know pre-filtering your tap

690
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,079
water

691
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,679
especially if you're in the city you

692
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,639
know because they are 100 adding

693
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,519
chlorine to it

694
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,960
you know um if you if you take some

695
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,038
water and res it

696
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,240
uh and if you have to use tap water and

697
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,079
you don't have a filter

698
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,279
you could like read some water and a

699
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,439
friend told me this you could

700
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,200
just literally stir it with your arm and

701
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,558
your your skin actually takes the

702
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
chlorine out of the water pretty

703
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,960
effectively

704
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
um and you don't have to do it very long

705
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,640
you do it for five minutes

706
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,319
four or five minutes not even not even

707
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
and you take a large percentage

708
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,599
like 80 percent of the chlorine out of

709
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,079
the water so it's pretty interesting

710
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,719
wow yeah right and you just mix it with

711
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,558
your arm

712
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,759
you know um so someone that doesn't have

713
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,918
the means of uh

714
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,519
the filter this and that they you know

715
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
but you're using tap water and has

716
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,839
chlorine in it

717
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,759
that's a way to take it out because your

718
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,079
body is a better you know might as well

719
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,079
we we filter out in the plant um you

720
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,319
know and especially not just the plant

721
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,599
the organisms that are are working with

722
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,359
the plant yeah i know

723
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,798
um so how long would you dip your hand

724
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,798
in there do you say like

725
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,960
well like i'm saying you know like um

726
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,558
say like it's a 55 gallon drum

727
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,079
stirred around with your whole arm for

728
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,759
four minutes like and that's

729
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,038
that's even a long time you know and

730
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,599
it's obviously you know sitting there

731
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:50,879
for

732
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,119
four or five minutes just stirring with

733
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
your arm but it that literally takes out

734
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,000
about 80 plus percent of

735
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
the chlorine that would come out of your

736
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,440
tap water and when you think about like

737
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,120
you go into a pool

738
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,558
and you come out and you smell like

739
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,959
chlorine and that's it

740
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,000
it's absorbed into your skin quite quite

741
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,519
quickly you know

742
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,519
and then the alternative ways to

743
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,679
dechlorinate would be just to you know

744
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:15,200
let your water sit out for

745
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,759
24 hours or so in light is ideal right

746
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,319
and then

747
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,919
um some people like air stones in it too

748
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,119
right air stones will kind of help

749
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,960
with dechlorinate gotcha yep um i

750
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,038
i may have heard that you know may off

751
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
gas but i've just heard

752
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,240
you know i've heard if you know if you

753
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,440
don't have a filter and you don't have a

754
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
way of deploying it

755
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,600
dechlorinating before you know just just

756
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,640
literally starting it with your arm

757
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,558
takes so much out

758
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,919
it's so simple and once my friend told

759
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,599
me that i was like damn i'll just you

760
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,038
know do that just to ensure that my plan

761
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,879
is even houseplant you know

762
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,319
sure how sponsors turn around you think

763
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,440
it's nothing but it's like you do it for

764
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,879
a little bit you're actually you're

765
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
actually making an effect on the water

766
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
because

767
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,558
your body your skin is absorbing it you

768
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,038
know that's interesting i didn't know

769
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,759
that

770
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,839
i actually tried to do a run with indoor

771
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,240
grow with tap water now my tap water

772
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,399
comes out at

773
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,400
485 ppm

774
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,720
so that's really high i think five over

775
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,840
500 is against like epa guidelines or

776
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,319
something like that so

777
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,720
are you in like are you in like an old

778
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,200
old building or like a cat uh like a

779
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,919
city city yeah yeah gotcha it could be

780
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,159
old pipes

781
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
you know very old pipes maybe it must be

782
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,640
yeah and i was looking at the water

783
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,918
sample report that they release

784
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,200
and it's like 80 ppm sodium so i think

785
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
that's like pretty high

786
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,120
and that's like it just destroyed my

787
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,359
plants like my plants i've never had

788
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,199
as unhealthy of plants before when i

789
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,359
used tap water and that's even when

790
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,519
with dechlorinating so like i've been

791
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,319
avoiding i've just been using ro for now

792
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,480
on

793
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,399
sodium yeah sodium will make your plants

794
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,558
look terrible i'm sure you know

795
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,519
and then it makes you realize how how um

796
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,278
how important

797
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,960
your water source is you know like your

798
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,640
starting water you know that's when i'm

799
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,278
thinking about synthetics it's like rl

800
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,679
you know just

801
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,119
oh i test it it's just zero ppm you know

802
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,919
it's like liquid gold to me when i think

803
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,918
about it you know

804
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,520
because you can dial you can dial it

805
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,880
into a t it's not gonna like uh you're

806
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,000
not gonna have many swings

807
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,559
phys up and down i don't know yeah

808
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,679
so speaking of do you ph your water all

809
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,480
right so

810
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,960
for synthetics um i always love to dial

811
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
you know

812
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
just dialing it in knowing what they're

813
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,480
getting um you know whether

814
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
you know i like to know the in and out

815
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
you know i'll even test my runoff um so

816
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
i do like to ph my water when i do feed

817
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
synthetics

818
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
um outdoors um depending on your

819
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
starting water you know like if it's

820
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
really high or low like you're saying

821
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,879
you know your your town water or

822
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
whatever the ph is i'm sure they have

823
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,039
haven't picked out quite

824
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,919
stable ph but like at my farm um

825
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,359
you know we have like a 6.2 to 6.5 well

826
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
water you know we don't have to change

827
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,158
that at all

828
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,919
you know so um but depending on our

829
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,039
input that we put into that water

830
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,759
whether it be like a t

831
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,558
brew it'll change the ph but i'm not

832
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,119
worried about

833
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,639
uh changing the ph of a t brew you know

834
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,479
something like that you don't have to

835
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
it's like there's so many buffers for

836
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
organics like in the organic medium it's

837
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
it's a buffer zone itself

838
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,240
you know there's so many different ph

839
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,919
ranges happening um you know it stays in

840
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
stable zone you know so like you can

841
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,400
give it

842
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
you know something that's a roundabout

843
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,080
and it'll become stable

844
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,359
um you know so if you're giving water to

845
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,839
a plant and it's not

846
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,038
it's not a living medium then you're

847
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,759
going to influence the

848
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,319
that ph very heavily just by the giving

849
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,558
you know

850
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,519
it's like um if you water to run off

851
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,879
you're resetting

852
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,278
um that that pot you know every time

853
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
so what if you gave it a certain ph

854
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,720
you're heavily going to influence it

855
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
it's um you know whether it goes up or

856
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,240
down well water out

857
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,319
when i make my super soil you know out

858
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,679
at the at like a farm location

859
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,359
while water right out of the hose you

860
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,240
know right onto the threat onto it not

861
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,399
having to worry about

862
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,000
ph because i know that i already tested

863
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
it that it's already in my range

864
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,558
basically

865
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,000
yeah yes yeah cool it is important

866
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,599
yeah you know because if you're not in

867
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
that range you know then you know things

868
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,079
aren't happening exchanges aren't

869
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,640
happening with the plant

870
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,319
and nutrient and um yeah you could just

871
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,360
things go really awry when you're not in

872
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,599
the right ph so

873
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,959
for sure you know it's good to know it

874
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,319
okay so we talked about pot size we

875
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
talked about your mix the initial

876
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,319
amendments that you put in there kind of

877
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,720
how you

878
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,798
how you're doing your watering um let's

879
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,759
talk about cover crops so you've planted

880
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,319
your seed

881
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,599
do you do any cover crops and when do

882
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,798
you plant them would you plant them at

883
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,839
the same time or

884
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:23,200
or different time or what gotcha um

885
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,639
yeah you know so i i kind of just always

886
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
used um

887
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
white dutch clover you know it's very

888
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,600
very available easy to get

889
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,120
uh buckwheat another one easy to get

890
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,158
um vetch you know

891
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,599
alfalfa so like a couple different kinds

892
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
of clover you can use um

893
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,918
red um crimson medium red

894
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,440
um yellow clover you know all good all

895
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,240
good ones but uh you know what you know

896
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,519
what they're doing

897
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,919
is um you know promoting mycorrhizal

898
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,278
fungi population you know and that's

899
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,320
what you want in your meat in your

900
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:00,400
organic medium

901
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:02,399
um when i start it you know so um

902
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
i'll start i'll use white dutch clover

903
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
from a solo cup

904
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,038
you know one gallon net all the way up

905
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,798
because

906
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,960
if the plant has not grown into the pot

907
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,639
completely and the top soil is not like

908
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,558
root system when you water it you'll

909
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
you'll have a disturbance of the medium

910
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,480
um you know and then when you start to

911
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
continuously water um it's not going to

912
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
evenly water the pot so if you have if

913
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,798
you have that white dutch clover on the

914
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,559
top

915
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,079
at whatever stage of growth you have

916
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,879
another root system for you to just

917
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,038
water on

918
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
um you can water heavily and it's not

919
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,879
gonna you know it'll drain better

920
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,599
because

921
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,278
those root systems are penetrating down

922
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,158
you'll just have a better um

923
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,038
oxygen oxygenation of your root zone um

924
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,399
just from having

925
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,558
just a little bit of white dutch clover

926
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,000
at whatever stage you grow um

927
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,319
but i i use a 12 seed cover crop

928
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,398
from from build the soil um and then it

929
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,119
can it consists of a lot of stuff i just

930
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,319
said but

931
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:57,599
it's also got like uh cow pee it's got

932
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,359
um peas like forage peas you would eat

933
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,398
you know uh

934
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,918
the buckwheat but consists of 12

935
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,558
different kinds of seeds you can

936
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
put you i i put that in the pot prior to

937
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,319
planting in it

938
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,240
um say like a couple weeks get

939
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,720
everything germinated it's all going you

940
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
know

941
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,399
and then even at the end of the season

942
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,319
you know um

943
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,000
after you crop your plants you got your

944
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,839
immediate your beds

945
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,880
or whatever outside um primarily beds

946
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,278
you uh you plant your cover crop in the

947
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
winter

948
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,038
even in the wintertime and uh as soon as

949
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,558
it comes to season you know they're not

950
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,240
going to germinate depending on how the

951
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,918
season goes when it's thaws and stuff

952
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,919
but a lot of them will potentially um

953
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,679
germinate as soon as the season comes

954
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,720
you know so you will also plant more as

955
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,038
the season

956
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,839
is there you know but it's like you

957
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,839
already put

958
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,278
seeds there that will germinate as soon

959
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,119
as they're able to outside

960
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,720
naturally you know so at the end of the

961
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,678
season when it's gonna go in the winter

962
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
and your beds are gonna be sitting there

963
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,798
all winter

964
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
plant coffee crop um and then in the

965
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,720
beginning of the season before you

966
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
plant lynch cover crop you'll have when

967
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
the when the soil is barren

968
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,599
and doesn't have any other other uh

969
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,640
plants on it yet

970
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,759
then you you know you plant these

971
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
beneficial

972
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,119
things and then you're gonna have less

973
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,158
weeds kind of you know you don't have to

974
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,000
um

975
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,760
chop and grow you don't have to choose

976
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,079
selectively weed you know you already

977
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,960
have

978
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,678
beneficial there um coverings covering

979
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,840
the ground

980
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,519
which will um take competition away the

981
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,959
other things that would have germinated

982
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,480
aren't able to germinate because you

983
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
have a more developed plant there

984
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
already

985
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,640
you know so the earlier you can get a

986
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
cover crop on the ground outdoor

987
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,520
is better you know as early as possible

988
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,240
and then when the ground is really

989
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,759
thawed to plant ganja you know then get

990
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,480
your ganja in the ground

991
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,960
okay so cover crop uh what about mulch

992
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
layer

993
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,720
so you know common practices for for

994
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,719
when growing organically is also have a

995
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,558
mulch layer on top of it you know

996
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,079
uh some people plant their cover crops

997
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,839
and then put the mulch layer immediately

998
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,599
over it and have the cover crop kind of

999
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,199
grow through the mulch layer

1000
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,359
what do you use for mulch layer and how

1001
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,038
do you apply it yeah you know it i mean

1002
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,639
everyone's different methods but you

1003
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,640
know aside from my my

1004
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
living cover crop which acts as a you

1005
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,360
know a mulch layer

1006
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,599
i like to use barley hay rice halls

1007
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,359
oak leaves you know whatever organic

1008
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,959
matter for outdoor particularly you know

1009
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,199
whatever organic matter you can just

1010
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,840
kind of chop up put on top your soil

1011
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,919
just to make it so the sun isn't just

1012
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,359
hitting your top soil directly it's

1013
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,278
you know it's not it's gonna make it dry

1014
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,319
out faster than it should um

1015
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,480
when you can have uh any kind of

1016
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,359
any kind of cover it could it could even

1017
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,519
be a

1018
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,879
completely dead you know say you just

1019
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,679
put like um

1020
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
like those row covers um cloth i mean

1021
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
you know just

1022
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
a cloth cover and it's and it's gonna

1023
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,839
make it so just the sun isn't hitting it

1024
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,760
directly it's just staying a little

1025
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,439
more wet you know more homogenous you

1026
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,038
know longer that's definitely the

1027
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,038
purpose of having mulches

1028
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,359
i i know people that don't use them but

1029
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,599
because their irrigation strategy

1030
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,398
is you know they're monitoring their

1031
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,639
moisture

1032
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,639
so you know they're just continuously

1033
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,799
irrigating and this is primarily indoor

1034
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,240
and when i grow outdoor it's like you

1035
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,960
you're dealing with the sun you know so

1036
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,839
it's you

1037
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,038
you gotta um you gotta use like living

1038
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,119
cover crop

1039
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,720
you know leaves mulch some like i'm

1040
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,239
saying any kind of organic matter that

1041
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,278
you can get together to put on top

1042
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,278
you know just just to make it

1043
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,558
more wet because what that's going to do

1044
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,960
is just prevent

1045
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,798
promote life you know you could have uh

1046
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,440
roots growing right to the top layer you

1047
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,839
just kind of

1048
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,600
put pull back your your cover crop or

1049
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,119
your your hay or whatever

1050
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,519
and then roots are growing right up into

1051
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,000
our worms or are eating things up to on

1052
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,640
top

1053
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,398
you know yeah i learned the hard way

1054
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,919
when i first switched to organics is i

1055
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,719
live in a very dry climate i live in the

1056
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,840
desert

1057
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,120
and you know that top soil drying out i

1058
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,839
mean the microbes are going dormant

1059
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,798
right they're not

1060
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,480
actively breaking down uh the organic

1061
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,960
matter at that time right so

1062
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,240
yeah me not using mulch layer i kind of

1063
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,519
screwed myself especially with the top

1064
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
dressing right because you're applying

1065
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,240
the top dressing

1066
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,640
if you're not putting a mulch layer over

1067
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
it well then if that top layer dries out

1068
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,278
you're not getting the break down and

1069
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,679
your plants are seeing deficiencies

1070
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,119
that's what happened with meat at least

1071
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,120
so yeah the importance of a mulch layer

1072
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,959
particularly for for someone like me

1073
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,398
yeah living in such a dry climate

1074
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,720
yeah you know these are you know these

1075
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,359
type of strategies that you can do with

1076
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,720
you know you know it gives you options

1077
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,519
you know you're in a desert

1078
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
you know if you're grown with you know a

1079
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,319
different medium you just keep on

1080
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
irrigating it you know that's it you

1081
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,759
just have to keep hearing you want to

1082
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
retain water you know

1083
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,278
watering it the least amount of times

1084
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,960
that that's more sustainable you know

1085
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,480
um so especially if you're growing food

1086
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,079
outside you know you'd be

1087
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,759
say irrigated at night you're in the

1088
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,639
desert irrigated at night because if

1089
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,919
you're if you're

1090
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
you're here again during the day it's a

1091
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
lot of evaporation happening you know so

1092
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,440
if you just irrigate them all throughout

1093
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
the night

1094
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,399
potentially they can get through the

1095
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,320
whole day without being watered so yeah

1096
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,918
you don't depend it depends for sure

1097
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,599
and i think you also mentioned in a

1098
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,000
previous conversation that you also do

1099
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,519
like the

1100
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
cut method where you're kind of cutting

1101
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,599
down the cover cup and then laying that

1102
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
down

1103
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,599
or um i don't know if you mentioned the

1104
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,880
leaves if you do like any

1105
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,959
defoliation and and lay those down as a

1106
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,320
cover cup as well do you do that at all

1107
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
oh 100 multiplayer

1108
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,359
shop oh definitely so chop and drop with

1109
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
no-till

1110
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,639
you know and with using you know these

1111
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,558
living soil methods

1112
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,000
you can just take all of your especially

1113
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,798
no-till method because you're utilizing

1114
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,880
worms in

1115
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,000
a you know living soil system you can

1116
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
just take everything that just

1117
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,759
came off of that plant vegetably and put

1118
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,919
it back into the pot or

1119
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,440
you know or bed that you used um and

1120
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
think about it as like the only thing

1121
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,720
that comes out of that pot is the actual

1122
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,158
nugs itself in the end you know

1123
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,759
everything else can go back into it you

1124
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,080
could chop up the

1125
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,839
stems everything and get it back onto

1126
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,720
there mulch it back into it you know

1127
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,278
cannabis

1128
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
stem mulch is you know best especially

1129
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,038
if it was

1130
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,840
or grown organically you know um

1131
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,798
and uh so like we were referring to say

1132
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,038
like your mulch

1133
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,240
uh grows up too much you know it's

1134
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,759
getting out of control

1135
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,319
starting to grow up to you know and

1136
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,879
starting to make airflow with strict

1137
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,038
airflow you could cut it back to a

1138
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,640
manageable level and then you could take

1139
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,838
all that organic matter

1140
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,320
um put it underneath the living uh cover

1141
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,799
crop

1142
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,760
and then um it's gonna stay wet it's

1143
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
gonna stay green

1144
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,480
for weeks literally um and and worms

1145
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,399
will be able to have an opportunity to

1146
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,800
uh to feed on it for that time

1147
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,759
instead of it say it'd be on barren soil

1148
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
top soil

1149
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,200
and say the sun's hitting it not indoors

1150
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,119
strengthening it it'll turn into

1151
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,199
carbon you know it'll it'll lose its

1152
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,679
moisture and become like a dry

1153
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,358
crinkled leaf so quick you know instead

1154
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,039
of you just putting it under something

1155
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,598
you can literally just put under a rock

1156
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,599
like i'll take like a lot of chop and

1157
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,159
drop like say like uh leads i take off

1158
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,760
the plant

1159
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,358
and i'll just take like uh one of the

1160
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,040
rocks i have in the alleyway

1161
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,878
i'll just put it underneath that you

1162
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,719
know and that's just worm food

1163
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,319
you know and within a few weeks it's

1164
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,878
already earthworm gas since it's already

1165
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,440
turned to

1166
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,480
you know turn to soil what type of worms

1167
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,240
do you use

1168
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,800
nate you know the native worms in my

1169
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,879
area i like to think about it as i'm

1170
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
creating a you know

1171
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
somewhere for them to live you know like

1172
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,838
my uh um

1173
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,480
my dog beds my hugel mounds uh my raised

1174
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,799
beds

1175
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
they all are like connected to the earth

1176
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,519
and have a way

1177
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,520
of native native uh worms to come into

1178
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,960
it and i don't even have to buy worms or

1179
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,119
add any worms you know but

1180
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,880
if i i have bought worms and the only

1181
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,599
ones that i have bought are red wigglers

1182
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,720
you know so um those are really good

1183
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,960
living soil system

1184
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,159
basically you only have to you know if

1185
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,320
you want to

1186
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,920
uh buy stuff for a living soil uh for

1187
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
indoors all you really need is just red

1188
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,358
wiggles but you can diversify it

1189
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,040
and go outside and go get some stuff

1190
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,598
like you're gonna go fishing and you go

1191
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,279
get some

1192
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,800
forms outside and then you bring them

1193
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
inside so you have a worm bin

1194
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,240
and then you put them in your worm bin

1195
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
and now you're diversifying your

1196
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,519
your work you know your worms yeah then

1197
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,440
there's also what the night crawlers so

1198
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,960
the the red wigglers is kind of up top

1199
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,519
soil and then the night crawlers kind of

1200
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,159
lower

1201
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,559
part of the soil yeah yeah yeah i forgot

1202
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,838
to say

1203
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,440
african nightcrawlers you know that's

1204
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,639
another great one they definitely are

1205
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,880
able to um

1206
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,319
to get you know deep you know they're

1207
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
they're fat some of them look like

1208
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,320
snakes you know

1209
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,559
um and uh yeah afghanistan those

1210
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,079
you know those two for sure the red red

1211
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,000
wigglers and the african nightcrawlers

1212
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,119
and like i'm saying any native worm that

1213
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,079
can that can come and

1214
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,119
live there that's beneficial and stuff

1215
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
so i know you already kind of said a

1216
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,880
little bit of advice but you have any uh

1217
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,358
advice for somebody who's just trying

1218
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,800
out worms for the first time maybe

1219
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,119
you know is there a specific amount they

1220
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,519
should use for a size grill pot or

1221
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,960
or what yeah like uh say like you're

1222
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,159
putting uh worms

1223
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,039
um into a 15 gallon soil

1224
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,239
15 got like a handful and that's like a

1225
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,000
perfect amount you know that

1226
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,519
and especially if that soil is you know

1227
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,440
good living soil system where they're

1228
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,400
able to proliferate and

1229
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,720
you know um and reproduce and those eggs

1230
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
are

1231
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,199
you know they're not just gonna you're

1232
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
not gonna water something on it's gonna

1233
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,838
kill everything

1234
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,199
uh i mean if you're gonna start out new

1235
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,440
you know try and have a worm bin you

1236
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,838
know because then you can buy worms

1237
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
and then you you know like i'm saying

1238
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,639
other than just your

1239
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,880
your your pots you're growing in you

1240
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,960
could have them reproducing and

1241
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,160
you could just take kitchen scraps and

1242
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,559
you know have them

1243
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,759
make soil um you know if you're if

1244
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,960
you're using if you're going to start

1245
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,520
out using worms it's great you're just

1246
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
going to be

1247
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,280
building soil for yourself i know um

1248
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
yeah love worms okay let's flip over and

1249
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,040

1250
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
i know you really like to talk about ipm

1251
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,358
in our last conversation you talked

1252
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,960
quite a bit about

1253
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,159
ipm what do you do for ipm i like to

1254
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,159
incorporate

1255
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:38,239
you know beneficial insects um

1256
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,078
uh like another like again you know i

1257

like to have the beneficial insects of

1258
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,960
my area come

1259
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:48,319
and inhabit you know my um my garden

1260
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,599
and and i invite them in you know um

1261
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,440
so i don't have to order them basically

1262
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,119
so like mantis ladybugs

1263
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,800
um pirate beetles you know lace wings

1264
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,119
tread or my other different kinds of

1265
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,519
predator mites as far as sprays go you

1266
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,240
know

1267
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,440
outdoor i'll use like aloe vera flakes

1268
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,479
neem oil

1269
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,639
um karanji oil um

1270
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,400
yucca for fighting like a pest

1271
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,480
i'll use the karanja oil and the neem

1272
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
oil as like a

1273
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,838
like right away it'll kill them you know

1274
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,519
it's like direct

1275
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,279
i'll i'll prune everything off the plant

1276
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,239
and then i'll hit him with i'll hit him

1277
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,599
with that

1278
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,118
karanja but if i'm not and i'm just kind

1279
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,760
of doing preventative spray

1280
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,240
you know you know to prevent pests and

1281
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
mold

1282
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,838
it's always like a uh aloe flake um

1283
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,200
with yucca which is just a wetting agent

1284
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,838
you know just so things stay wetter

1285
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,799
longer

1286
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,400
um so i think of it and um and it's like

1287
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
you're just kind of washing them down

1288
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
um periodically whenever you want you

1289
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,079
know you can put be on your own schedule

1290
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,279
um your own itunes ipm schedule for your

1291
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,760
outdoor plants just kind of wash them

1292
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,040
down with

1293
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:59,200
aloe indoors i i spray

1294
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:01,279
a couple things 203 and 209 from sns

1295
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,879
i'll also root drench a couple of those

1296
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
whenever a problem like if i have like

1297
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,960
fungus gnats i'll i'll

1298
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,240
also drench 209 for like a whole week

1299
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,240
and i'll uh

1300
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,519
i'll i'll eliminate the fungus gnats

1301
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,759
refer for synthetic you know indoors

1302
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,838
i know jay plants for outdoor jade plant

1303
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,200
speaker he'll spray

1304
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:24,000
periodically uh em5 can build the soil

1305
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,960
um you know which is keeps things very

1306
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,599
sterile

1307
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,159
and it's organic so he'll do that all

1308
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,000
throughout

1309
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,519
you know his processes until he gets the

1310
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,358
flower which then he doesn't

1311
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,719
doesn't uh spray anything and i feel the

1312
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,559
same way i don't like spraying anything

1313
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,759
in flowers like your ipm

1314
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,320
is the preventative you know

1315
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,280
preventative for that um proper pruning

1316
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
air movement

1317
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,960
you know that's crucial you know uh

1318
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,559
that's all that's part of an ipm

1319
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,400
regiment you know um

1320
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,599
periodically making sure there's enough

1321
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,000
air flow um

1322
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,680
and your air quality and your spaces are

1323
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,320
are adequate for the plant's health

1324
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,679
and stuff like that it's super crucial

1325
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,800
um

1326
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,399
indoors i'll spray plants with citric

1327
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,079
acid

1328
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,838
you can make your own solution of it but

1329
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,240
i like to just use the big

1330
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,400
time exterminator which is just

1331
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,838
basically citric acid dilute you know

1332
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,680
uh and that i've i've used that i've

1333
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:20,000
killed thrips i've killed um aphids

1334
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,960
uh on clones which i took from outdoor

1335
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,719
brought them in

1336
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,039
um and they and then after a couple

1337
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,719
weeks i see i see thrips and stuff on

1338
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,920
them i'll spray them with that with that

1339
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:32,399
um citric acid uh

1340
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
every day for two weeks and uh like i'm

1341
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,240
like i'm power washing the plant

1342
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,039
and i'm and and i get them good you know

1343
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,039
that stuff

1344
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,400
you know so that's another good uh

1345
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,559
another good thing to use that the

1346
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,039
plants aren't going to be negatively uh

1347
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,039
affected by and you can douse them with

1348
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,079
uh with a dilute citric acid you

1349
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,920
definitely don't want to be

1350
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,680
you know used too much that's why i use

1351
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,200
uh the big time exterminator you know

1352
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,239
they're doing the dilution for me i

1353
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,919
don't have to put

1354
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,598
any uh you know i don't have to dilute

1355
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,519
it myself and [ __ ] up you know

1356
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,880
things like that got it now are you are

1357
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,318
you rotating these

1358
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,559
sprays so you're doing it like a

1359
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,480
different spray yeah okay yeah

1360
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,239
for sure yeah like um yeah all those

1361
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,519
ones i listed you know i'll i'll

1362
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,759
i'll uh i'll switch it up um and and

1363
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,440
uh you know when i switch it up i i'm

1364
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,880
not running into problems you know the

1365
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,720
only problem i run into

1366
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,640
indoors is just a couple like nap you

1367
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,239
know or something like that which a lot

1368
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,440
of growers can have problems with but i

1369
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,318
use nematodes

1370
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,559
and uh and a couple sprays to get rid of

1371
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,800
them

1372
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,719
quickly you know one other thing i use

1373
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,200
for an ipm is that cap and jack

1374
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,559
dead bug you know that's a good thing i

1375
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,159
like to have things that i can just

1376
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,759
spray all over the plant and it's not

1377
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,879
going to negatively affect it

1378
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,800
um you know even though i i did list uh

1379
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
that meme and karanja you 100

1380
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,400
can use too much you know you want to

1381
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,318
use be sparing you want to just think

1382
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,519
about it as you're

1383
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,358
you're you're kind of putting a

1384
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,960
sunscreen on your your plant

1385
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,838
um and the plan and then an insect or

1386
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,358
something

1387
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,039
won't enjoy it if they come and try and

1388
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,719
eat it something like that you know you

1389
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,880
don't want to put too much

1390
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,318
because if you use too much oil sun is

1391
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,160
hitting it and you put too much oil

1392
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,920
you can burn your plant just from the

1393
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,440
sun magnifying against it

1394
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
you know and especially when it's in

1395
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,559
water so water and oil

1396
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,800
and then the sun you're literally just

1397
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,039
magnifying it on on the leaf it'll burn

1398
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,680
it

1399
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,119
okay so we talked about how you you have

1400
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,759
that initial mix and you're adding the

1401
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,200
abandonments

1402
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,560
it's super soil right and and

1403
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,559
you're trying to get through the entire

1404
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,960
grow with just that

1405
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,078
super soil now do you do any type of top

1406
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
dressings

1407
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,760
throughout the grow at all if so when do

1408
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,000
you apply them and what do they consist

1409
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,200
of

1410
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,079
i apply worm casting to plants at

1411
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,439
all stages you know uh quality earthworm

1412
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,039
castings i'll just put it right on the

1413
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,880
top soil and water them in real good um

1414
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,039
like i'm saying at any stage all the way

1415
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,280
to end of flower if i want you know top

1416
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,400
you know earth earthworm castings are

1417
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,480
great um

1418
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,800
top dress i top dress compost and i'll

1419
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,838
water that in real good

1420
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,240
i use bio live um down to earth

1421
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,119
fertilizers you know that's uh that's

1422
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,479
super simple

1423
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,760
um top dress that on i'll do that like

1424
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,159
when i transplant

1425
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,200
like maybe after like three weeks in the

1426
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,000
flower

1427
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,598
i'll you know i'll uh hit i'll put some

1428
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,519
bio live on top

1429
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,200
it just consists of like it's fish bone

1430
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,599
meal um

1431
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,639
fish meal alfalfa meal crab meal shrimp

1432
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,119
meal

1433
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,559
lambonite and kelp you know so just a

1434
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,079
bunch of organic stuff

1435
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,799
whatever you have laying around when you

1436
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,280
start buying you know a lot of bags

1437
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,560
of organic amendments make your super

1438
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,119
soil you're gonna have a lot of extra

1439
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,279
stuff

1440
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,880
so um you know whatever's laying around

1441
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,640
at a time you can you can kind of give

1442
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,000
them a little boost and top dress that

1443
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,118
on when it's needed

1444
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,800
when they're at when they're kind of

1445
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,480
asking for it got it so you just kind of

1446
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,280
look at the plant kind of read the plant

1447
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,039
maybe you see

1448
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
it fades a little bit and then and then

1449
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,639
you apply it at that point okay

1450
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,559
yeah definitely and depending on the

1451
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:55,519
stage you know just depending where

1452
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,279
they're supposed to be

1453
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,199
you know where um what i know where

1454
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,800
they're supposed to be um at certain

1455
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,279
stages of flower or veg

1456
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,720
um and uh and like i'm saying like i'll

1457
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,640
top dress when i like

1458
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,239
when i trans when i freshly transplant

1459
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,838
or say if something has been sitting in

1460
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,639
a pot for a long time and its roots have

1461
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:12,960
taken it up i

1462
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,318
definitely have to get something on top

1463
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,039
for it to start feeding again

1464
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,838
because the ganja plants root system uh

1465
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,599
it's like a

1466
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,519
it's like a upside down um iceberg

1467
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,680
it's feeder roots they're all on top

1468
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,000
when you have it in a pot it's like it's

1469
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,879
it'll like take up the pot but if it was

1470
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,039
on the ground

1471
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,800
it would just spread out like spread

1472
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,119
right out it'll it'll penetrate pretty

1473
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,240
good

1474
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,358
so um a clone will penetrate the ground

1475
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,118
14 inches

1476
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,480
and a seed will penetrate into the

1477
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,480
ground 36 inches

1478
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,318
and that's because of the tap root and

1479
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,318
um you know so

1480
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,239
you think of it like oh well i have a

1481
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,119
pot that's long you know bigger than 36

1482
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,598
inches and went all the way to the

1483
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,119
bottom

1484
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,880
that's those are feeder roots that would

1485
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,358
have been on the top and they literally

1486
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,960
just go

1487
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,279
down you know they're in a pot they're

1488
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,400
in a pot and they're restricted being

1489
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,839
restricted in all all

1490
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,440
you know all directions so it has to

1491
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,759
compensate for that now do you

1492
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,240
incorporate any sugars into your garden

1493
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,240
i don't i mean i use molasses sometimes

1494
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,439
but you know someone said to me like oh

1495
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,159
that's like putting tar

1496
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,838
all over your garden you know i i

1497
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,920
understand when you use too much of it

1498
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,279
but i know people that use it sparingly

1499
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
and have good results you know so

1500
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,359
sometimes i will use it when i

1501
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,599
want to see a fattening in flower you

1502
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,480
know to give a boost to the population

1503
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,920
of microbes

1504
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,400
you know because those are what's going

1505
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,159
to work for me so that's the that's the

1506
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,318
reason for using a sugar you know as a

1507
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,559
food source you know um but

1508
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,519
it's like there's other food sources

1509
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,318
other than you know

1510
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,519
i i just i haven't they've dived into

1511
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,000
using others

1512
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,679
other kinds of sugars one thing i i do

1513
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,880
use is brown sugar

1514
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:49,679
but i use it to um to make

1515
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,000
korean natural farming inputs so k f uh

1516
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,519
like

1517
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,119
fpj um from fermented plant juice or

1518
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,599
making um a fish amino acid faa

1519
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,800
so you know you could just take fish you

1520
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,400
know or plant

1521
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,920
and you weigh them out and then you add

1522
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,880
brown sugar and

1523
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,559
the brown sugar is taking out the water

1524
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,640
out of that you know so

1525
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,480
you know i'm using it i'm utilizing the

1526
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,598
osmotic pressure of that sugar

1527
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,760
but then i all i'm also use it it'll

1528
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,680
act as a food source you know for

1529
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,240
microbes when i water that

1530
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,598
in as well but uh not primarily straight

1531
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,199
brown sugar you know i won't just put

1532
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,000
brown sugar in the water and not water

1533
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,960
that in

1534
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,838
so you know molasses and the brown sugar

1535
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,240
from

1536
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,960
my uh k f inputs are the only two sugars

1537
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,959
i use

1538
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,119
gotcha yeah what about microbial

1539
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,240
inoculants do you use any of those

1540
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,838
um i like root wise organics um in

1541
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:48,078
for indoors great white mammoth microbe

1542
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:51,119
at you know azo um em1 em1 is uh

1543
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,960
is lactic acid bacteria well not just

1544
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,800
lactic acid bacteria but um

1545
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,400
you know that's another thing i'll add

1546
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
i'll make my own lab

1547
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,240
um you can take you can take uh

1548
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,920
unpasteurized milk

1549
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,159
right you know right out of the cow and

1550
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,838
you mix it with water that

1551
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,799
you add you take rice you wash the rice

1552
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,039
off you watch this

1553
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,240
wash the stock start off the rice and

1554
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,480
you take that rice

1555
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,919
washed water and you mix it with the

1556
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,318
unpasteurized milk

1557
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,079
and you can you can make a serum of

1558
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:22,558
lactic acid bacteria

1559
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,318
and that's inoculate you can use in

1560
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,800
water and give to your plants you could

1561
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,599
spray

1562
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,318
lab on your plants it'll prevent mold

1563
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,200
and then when you

1564
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,358
water it into the soil it breaks things

1565
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,919
down readily

1566
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,558
and think about it as like utilizing the

1567
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,079
stomach

1568
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,079
of the of the cow um it's bacteria it

1569
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,079
has like five stomachs and it has

1570
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,079
these lactic acid bacteria you know in

1571
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,160
its stomachs is the same thing as us

1572
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,519
but you know we have lactic acid but

1573
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,318
they also have they have five stomachs

1574
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,639
of it you know

1575
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,920
so you're utilizing what that does in

1576
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,239
its stomach

1577
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,519
in water and then you put over on your

1578
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,519
soil and it helps break

1579
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,159
things helps break organic matter down

1580
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,400
into a soluble form of plants

1581
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,199
the other k and f inputs i'll do you

1582
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,240
know

1583
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:11,519
which i learned from online chris

1584
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:14,239
through chris trump uh are uh

1585
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,318
imo one through five so you'll take

1586
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,439
indigenous microorganisms

1587
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:21,920
um which is fungus uh

1588
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,280
bacteria living living in your you know

1589
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,519
outside in nature

1590
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,400
um and you'll you'll capture it and

1591
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,440
you'll get that

1592
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,559
into a state that you can then

1593
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,159
um put into water which then

1594
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,319
and you know makes the spores go into

1595
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:40,480
solution and then you water that in so

1596
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:42,558
um that those methods are are um

1597
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,760
something i'm very new to the the imo

1598
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
135. i haven't

1599
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,200
dived into it i just know a lot about

1600
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,799
him and the way i even know a lot about

1601
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,199
them i just literally go on youtube

1602
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,800
and go to chris trump's uh youtube and

1603
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,039
i'm taking notes on it you know

1604
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,880
um until i get my own experience you

1605
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,599
know i'm getting good at it

1606
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,039
um but you can get it to the point where

1607
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,280
you just take like the size of your

1608
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,039
pinky you put it in a 55 gallon drum and

1609
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,280
you just inoculated the whole drum

1610
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,719
with fungus beneficial fungus you know

1611
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,960
and that fungus was

1612
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,558
captured indigenous in your area right

1613
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,440
outside if you have like a

1614
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,000
field or something and underneath the

1615
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,599
tree

1616
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,679
that that you go and you you look under

1617
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,800
some leaves it's nice white mycelium

1618
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,159
growing that's the stuff

1619
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,400
you know you can get that in your own

1620
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,440
grow room um not just outside

1621
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
because that's the best types of

1622
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,039
microbes you can use is what's

1623
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,960
in your area that grows best in your

1624
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,558
climate uh another another kind of

1625
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,720
inoculant though you know i'll take

1626
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,880
freshly picked mushrooms i got like

1627
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,719
beach mushrooms that are growing um

1628
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,720
kind of in a low low area on my property

1629
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,000
and i'll just take those fresh i'll put

1630
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,399
them in a tea bag

1631
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,199
that i'll like i would brew a compost

1632
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,599
tea in

1633
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,279
and i'll just soak those 24 hours very

1634
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,359
heavily aerated

1635
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,040
and then just water that all over all

1636
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,838
over the bed and then i'll take what's

1637
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,358
in the bag

1638
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,039
and i'll just mulch that on the top

1639
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,078
layer you know i'll take that all those

1640
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,920
chopped up uh

1641
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,280
mushrooms i harvested a couple of few

1642
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,200
days you know yesterday

1643
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,559
and then just mulch that all over the

1644
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,960
top soil um

1645
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,880
i've seen uh you know big blooms of of

1646
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,880
mycelium come after i do that

1647
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,318
so con area to compost teas let's talk a

1648
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,880
little bit more more about that

1649
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,960
what aerated compost teas do you use do

1650
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,358
you do any like nutrient teas

1651
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,159
seed spotted teas anything like that i i

1652
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,279
like to do

1653
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:27,279
compost tea um in particular um

1654
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,559
i'll take earthworm castings i'll take

1655
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,200
nice quality compost

1656
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,559
and just make a nice aerated tea with

1657
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,239
just those things you know

1658
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,720
because that's that's a real benefit you

1659
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,318
know whenever

1660
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,318
you can brew it up you say you want to

1661
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,759
do it two to three times a week

1662
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:43,358
and you can you don't have to do the

1663
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,079
same key every time you could do just

1664
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:48,400
compost

1665
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,480
that you do another tea tea brew of um

1666
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,519
uh you throw some mineral in there you

1667
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,838
know you basalt

1668
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,119
you put oyster shell you flour you could

1669
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,719
put some kelp or

1670
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,160
whatever like i'm saying whatever you

1671
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,919
want to put um

1672
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,078
in small amounts and brew it up into

1673
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,880
solution but another thing with with

1674
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,200
brewing

1675
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,800
is the time you do it because you don't

1676
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,558
want it to go anaerobic and it can go

1677
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,280
anaerobic really quick on you so say you

1678
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,240
brew it for

1679
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,160
say over 24 hours and i don't like to do

1680
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,039
brews more than 24 hours now now that i

1681
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,318
learned that type of stuff

1682
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,920
you brew it and then you stop the

1683
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,199
aeration you don't feed it and you let

1684
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,039
it sit there for

1685
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,039
not even a day it is very heavily

1686
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,519
anaerobic um you know and

1687
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,639
and uh you can make things go awry in

1688
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,639
your soil system

1689
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,719
with with giving them large volumes of

1690
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,239
anaerobic teeth you know

1691
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:35,919
or if it's too concentrated and you

1692
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,679
don't dilute it i'll definitely make a

1693
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,318
tea and then dilute that and then give

1694
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,960
it to them

1695
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:41,519
as far as sprouted seed cheese um i

1696
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,639
haven't

1697
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,039
i haven't used sprouted teas much um at

1698
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,639
if

1699
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,239
you know if not at all i've taken some

1700
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,159
corn and sprout and

1701
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,000
done some stuff with corn but um i've

1702
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,639
just heard that it can

1703
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,440
negatively affect uh fungus um it's

1704
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,318
definitely

1705
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,519
um going to help the the root system

1706
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,800
because it's sending

1707
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,519
sending signals um with enzymes that

1708
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,559
those

1709
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,400
those those seeds had but you could

1710
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,000
with the with the possibility of it

1711
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,318
negatively affecting you know what i'm

1712
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
trying

1713
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,440
a population of fungus that i'm trying

1714
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,079
to promote and

1715
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,720
and have lived you know i just don't try

1716
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,359
it you know

1717
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,639
um i may try it on small volumes of soil

1718
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,799
like 30 gallons

1719
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,239
and i'll through some seed and i still

1720
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,640
haven't done it in all my experience you

1721
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,039
know i

1722
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,039
um i just know you could pop see you

1723
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,679
know sprout a bunch of corn or sprout

1724
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,199
seeds

1725
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,960
blend them up and then give them the

1726
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,879
plants and and it helps them

1727
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,318
um i have friends that do it and tell me

1728
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,838
it gives them bigger buds

1729
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:39,599
and like i said but then i have people

1730
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,279
that tell me it negatively affects

1731
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,960
their their fungus that's just why i'm

1732
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,839
hesitant to do that it's probably

1733
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,440
cute but as far as other oxygenated uh

1734
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,838
compost teas fungal

1735
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,960
fungal teas you want that type of stuff

1736
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,480
to as

1737
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,000
often as you can do it like two to three

1738
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,119
times a week is a good time is a good

1739
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
amount a lot you know

1740
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,599
um and and sparingly you don't have to

1741
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,719
root drench you can just give a little

1742
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,880
bit to them

1743
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,480
just to keep the soil moist one more

1744
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,880
thing about the cheese um

1745
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
so i i was looking you know i'm building

1746
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,318
a tea brewer

1747
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,760
right now and i see a lot of people on

1748
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,199
the market inflating

1749
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,800
the volcano um style which is like you

1750
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:20,078
just it's a big bubble tech

1751
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,839
tech and it just sends a big you know uh

1752
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,000
amount of air from the bottom up

1753
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,880
instead of um doing you know which is

1754
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,440
another another kind

1755
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,119
of the cyclone you know there's more

1756
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,240
moving parts to that cyclone

1757
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:35,519
um key brewer that you'd have to clean

1758
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,679
or or whatever but um the volcano one

1759
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,679
less moving parts um and it and it

1760
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,759
brings you to dissolve oxygen levels

1761
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,239
faster so those that's what i'm looking

1762
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,119
into i'm just retrofitting a v bottom i

1763
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,759
already have

1764
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,240
um with a couple things um so i went to

1765
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,760
synergyagpro.com

1766
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,838
which took me a little bit of time to

1767
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,119
find this and they have a stainless

1768
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,639
steel manifold

1769
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,039
that goes with with clamps on the bottom

1770
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,440
of your

1771
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,079
uh your v bottom and uh and then you can

1772
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,039
hook up

1773
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,079
you know a diaphragm pump to that as

1774
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,199
well as a

1775
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,640
air pump and

1776
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,919
in particular you want to use diaphragm

1777
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,799
pumps because if you use another pump

1778
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,760
with a propeller

1779
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,599
you can you can um negatively affect the

1780
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,599
microbes you just brewed and

1781
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,960
so you could negatively affect them

1782
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,440
while you're pumping them to your plants

1783
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,720
if you're not using a diaphragm pump

1784
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,720
yeah and you're using a pump with a

1785
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,358
propeller you know it'll just chop the

1786
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,838
little guys

1787
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,119
up real good i i just recently i just

1788
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,239
recently learned that too which is

1789
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,318
pretty intriguing

1790
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,279
yeah that is interesting yeah you know

1791
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:37,119
diaphragm pump

1792
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,400
type diaphragm pump when you're feeding

1793
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,358
when you're feeding a

1794
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,358
compost tea you know or you uh you know

1795
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,239
do something by gravity or hand feed it

1796
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:46,400
or something like that

1797
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,239
so i have a viewer question from the

1798
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,160
last episode that we

1799
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,000
we filmed you were talking about a

1800
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,639
geodesic dome that you were just

1801
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,119
perching

1802
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,480
purchasing at the time so first off if

1803
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,079
you can just explain to the viewers what

1804
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,240
a geodesic dome is

1805
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,119
and then also how you utilized it how it

1806
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,519
turned out for you

1807
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,119
the geodesic dome you know it's a dome

1808
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,079
made from triangles

1809
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,119
and uh that structure itself is super

1810
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,440
strong

1811
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,318
very very you know it can take a snow a

1812
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,798
snow load

1813
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:15,519
um that's why people like using for

1814
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,559
greenhouses

1815
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,559
you know so say my mine is

1816
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,640
rated for 100 feet of snow it's rated

1817
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,240
for the an alaskan snow load where the

1818
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,199
snow will fall and not melt and then

1819
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,639
continue to snow

1820
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:30,399
you know um so the geodesic dome is just

1821
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,558
very nice strong structure and then i

1822
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,960
have the polycarbonate plates

1823
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,079
on the outside of it so it it's rated

1824
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,440
for 25 years

1825
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,280
some people when they have their

1826
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,119
polyethylene coupe houses

1827
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,359
you got to replace it sometimes every

1828
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,960
season maybe if you can get by maybe

1829
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,558
three years two to three years

1830
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,400
and then you're replacing your plastic i

1831
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,480
like the idea of just being you know me

1832
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,480
use buying the extra investment and

1833
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,559
putting down for polycarbonate

1834
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,960
and then um i don't have to replace that

1835
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,040
for 25 years i just clean the panels off

1836
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,240
on the outside and inside and keep them

1837
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,920
you know quality

1838
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,838
i haven't been posting much about it the

1839
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,240
town that i that we're growing in

1840
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,440
um just kind of gave us a hard time when

1841
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,078
we were first starting out

1842
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,639
you know they saw a lot of plants um and

1843
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,079
they came

1844
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,400
they came knocking basically you know

1845
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,480
and they're all hemp plants though um

1846
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,838
but uh i just haven't been posting for

1847
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,280
for that reason you know we're kind of

1848
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,519
keeping it on the gl

1849
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,559
um i will be posting about it in the

1850
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,480
future um

1851
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,480
once once we're more comfortable we're

1852
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,960
doing a lot of retrofitting but uh

1853
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,318
soon with that with it um we're we're

1854
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,838
going to be installing

1855
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:37,440
the agnetix lights with um either

1856
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:39,679
radiantly heated beds or um

1857
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,480
benches and uh which are really cool

1858
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,719
because um

1859
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,679
those those that will help uh heat the

1860
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,239
environment as well

1861
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,598
you know so um we're we're excited for

1862
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,759
those retrofits um

1863
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,920
soon but uh yeah hopefully down the road

1864
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
um i'll be able to post more about it

1865
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,000
um on my instagram but also i'll be

1866
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,078
having you know a youtube

1867
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,679
that i'll be uh i'll be doing that will

1868
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,440
be primarily about the hemp

1869
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,279
um so people can look forward to that

1870
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,200
about the geodome all right a few more

1871
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,680
questions and then i'll let you go

1872
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,519
so what advice do you have for growers

1873
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:10,480
who are just getting started with

1874
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,440
organics

1875
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,760
it's definitely the laid-back form you

1876
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,480
know

1877
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,160
of growing um you know you have more

1878
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,000
more of a buffer zone you know you could

1879
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,759
kind of mess something up and it's not

1880
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,559
as detrimental as growing

1881
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,280
with with salts you know so that's a

1882
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,880
good

1883
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,798
good thing about you know going down

1884
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,480
this this rabbit hole kind of um

1885
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:32,159
but you don't want to you don't want to

1886
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,920
go into it thinking you know everything

1887
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,199
um you know things could be going well

1888
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,280
but then you're

1889
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,318
presented with something that's foreign

1890
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,319
and you're just not ready

1891
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:41,599
you know so um you definitely want to

1892
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:43,759
kind of wrap your head around

1893
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,720
everything that could um what's going on

1894
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,599
what could happen

1895
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,838
um because uh scaling is tough you know

1896
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,920
doing it on a small scale is um

1897
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,960
weight really doable but doing organics

1898
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,159
on a large scale

1899
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,000
you need to be on your toes for sure um

1900
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,239
but it could be the very laid back you

1901
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,039
know for for growing in on a small scale

1902
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,118
and be

1903
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,480
the style that people want you know to

1904
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,798
get it on cruise control though

1905
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,838
like yeah like you need to wrap your

1906
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,318
head around it because that's what it

1907
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:10,318
can be

1908
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,000
you know it can be you just you're just

1909
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,558
watering it you don't have to be doing

1910
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,920
much ph of anything and it can give you

1911
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,240
more time to do other stuff

1912
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,280
so you know and maybe check out chris

1913
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,679
trump you know on

1914
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,559
on youtube because uh he's one of like a

1915
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,879
mentor

1916
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,160
and and someone that that um even me you

1917
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,680
know with all my experience i'm just

1918
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,920
learning so much from every day i take

1919
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:33,519
so many notes and i still need to uh

1920
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,280
get into um that um k and f

1921
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,719
uh techniques more you know because they

1922
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,200
can be so beneficial

1923
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,039
um and also maybe follow build the soil

1924
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,118
on instagram

1925
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,960
check their website out so much free

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,679
start out as a

1928
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,440
you know a home grower you could just

1929
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,000
get shipped right to your house you know

1930

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,480
never was an option in the past

1932
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,159
um to be to do this organic stuff you'd

1933
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,240
have to really look into it

1934
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,519
and figure things out yourself which is

1935
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,639
tough um

1936
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,679
