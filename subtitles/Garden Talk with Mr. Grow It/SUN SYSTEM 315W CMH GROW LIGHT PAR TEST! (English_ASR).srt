00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,658
what's up everybody feel that don't love

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,549
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:08,580
you'll watch on my extras channel this

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,269
is a 315 watt CMH girl light kit and

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:16,048
includes the Sun system 315 Neutron CMH

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,050
reflector philips master color 315 watt

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,689
3100 kelvin bulb and prism lighting

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,980
science at 315 watt ballast i'll link

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,018
this kid in the description section

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,399
below in this video I'm not going to go

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,649
over into the features or anything like

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,649
that I am just going to do a part estÃ¡n

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,199
it I'll use the Apple gmq 500 par meter

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,780
of measurements are taken MP PFD and

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,329
this meter measures 389 nanometers to

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,399
692 nanometers plus or minus 5

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,649
nanometers so if any light is being

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,719
emitted that is outside that range it

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,189
won't show up on this par meter and this

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,410
is just to give you a general idea of

21
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,669
what the power output is for this light

22
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,439
this isn't gonna be on to present

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,359
accurate I'm taking measurements in a

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,399
grow tent the reflective walls could

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,259
increase these numbers so just keep that

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,850
in mind this light is a flowering

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,890
coverage area of three foot by three

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,989
foot and I have it in a 4 foot by 4 foot

29
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,400
grow tent so I'm actually not going to

30
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,019
bring this sensor all the way to the

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
corner of the grow tent I'll try to keep

32
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,618
it at three foot by 3 foot space I'll

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,439
take three different measurements 12

34
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,599
inches away 24 inches away and 36 inches

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,209
away these seem to be the most common

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,589
light distances for CMH grow lights just

37
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,029
like all the other part test videos I do

38
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,790
I'll let them measurements do the

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,468
talking

40
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,469

what do you think of these measurements

45
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:44,250
let me know by leaving a comment below

46
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,659
and again I have provided a link to this

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,340
grow light in the description section

48
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,449
below so you can learn more that's

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,740
pretty much it for this video guys if

50
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,959
you enjoyed it please click that thumbs

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,000
up and I will leave it at that thank you
