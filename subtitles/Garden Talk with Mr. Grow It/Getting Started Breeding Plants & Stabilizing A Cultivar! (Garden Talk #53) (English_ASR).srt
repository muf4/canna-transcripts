1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
coming up on garden talk but if you

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
start throwing things into the mix and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
just kind of chucking pollen around and

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,638
kind of getting away from the grand

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
vision of what you actually enjoy and

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,160
want to keep carrying on that's when

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,678
you're going to run into problems the

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
purple thing is something that you

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,399
wanted

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,760
then yes that's something that i would

11
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,000
try to take into consideration when i

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
was looking for a male but what a lot of

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,839
people don't know is that pollen can be

14
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,480
extremely volatile and

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,160
it can become infertile very quickly

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
you're going to get a mix of your two

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
favorites you've now collided them

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
together and you're gonna get

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
potentially the best of both worlds i'm

20
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,799
looking for things like fast flowering

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
time resistance to white powdered mildew

22
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,078
how well they can handle the cold also

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
how well they can handle the heat

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
because it's still gonna get hot here

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
too if you can't eat the vegetable or

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
whatever it is at the end because it's

27
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
all filled with bugs or the plant was

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,760
diseased and didn't finish it then it

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,759
basically isn't any good anyway

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
what's up everybody if you that don't

31

have you on board today

96
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,598
uh we are gonna talk about plant

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
breeding so kind of getting started

98
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,799
plant breeding i feel like there's a lot

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,878
of people out there who are

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
interested in haven't taken that step

101
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
yet in order to do it or they've just

102
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,439
started doing it

103
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
and they kind of need some more

104
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,120
information on which way to go because

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
there are i feel like there are several

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
different ways you can go when it comes

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
to breeding there are several different

108
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,798
techniques and ways you can stabilize

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,120
strains and so on and so forth so also

110
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
stabilizing a cultivar is kind of what

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,039
we'll get into today as well as as we go

112
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,359
along here so

113
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,719
but first how about an introduction want

114
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
to tell us a little bit about yourself

115
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,158
and kind of how you got into gardening

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
and breeding

117
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,280
all right so uh

118
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,919
i got into

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
uh gardening and breeding probably from

120
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,238
you know my mother at a very early age

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,360
she was uh licensed by health canada she

122
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
provided medicine for people who who uh

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,000
couldn't grow it themselves so that's

124
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,399
how i initially got into growing

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,238
um and and learning about

126
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
all kinds of plants was just because my

127
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,478
mother had like a very uh

128
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,799
you know sort of

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,120
self-driven kind of take on life where

130
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
she wanted to be able to supply her own

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
um

132
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
own whether it be food or

133
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
uh

134
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,680
food or medicine or drink or whatever it

135
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,918
was so

136
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
that was how i i originally got into

137
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,599
gardening and then that sort of picked

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
up into

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
wanting to be able to share

140
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,959
some of the things that she did back in

141
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
the early days with other people which

142
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,279
is what led into canadian leap genetics

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
um

144
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,599
yeah so that's kind of how i've gotten

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
to where i am today this mostly goes a

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,639
lot to my parents my dad was involved a

147
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,119
little bit too but mostly to my mom

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
yeah she really brought that the the

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,879
green thumb out of me and uh

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,319
brought me to this sort of breeding

151
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,759
point where i am today where i wanted to

152
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,439
bring that back and share with people so

153
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,080
that they could have success

154
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,680
growing uh different cultivars in canada

155
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,879
because as the as you know it's kind of

156
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
hard up here

157
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,519
if you're trying to grow and complete a

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,959
season

159
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,839
um

160
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,519
you know

161
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,799
regardless of whatever plan it is you're

162
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,478
growing you might run into the same

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
issues so you mentioned before we

164
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,758
started recording that you have been

165
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,439
breeding for about five years now how

166
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
many different cultivars have you

167
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,160
created so far

168
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
um so i think on the website i've got

169
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
probably

170
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
six specific different cultivars on

171
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,079
there that i would say

172
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,719
are

173
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,839
are completely stabilized and that if if

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
you get them

175
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,399
it's going to grow exactly what it's

176
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
supposed to grow

177
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,439
in regards to what i had intended for it

178
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:50,639
to do

179
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,399
yeah i think there's six on there i'd

180
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,879
have to double check but pretty sure if

181
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,679
i recall

182
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,439
and

183
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,918
i'm working on another one right now so

184
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,759
it'll be about seven

185
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,959
again it takes a long time to actually

186
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
get them

187
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,959
to the point

188
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,240
to a point where something is stabilized

189
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,000
so i was lucky having things

190
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
um that were

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,639
that were you know in

192
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,319
initially were sort of just being paul

193
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,560
and chucked around from my mother but

194
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
that would be going back like into the

195
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
early years and then i've brought it

196
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,400
kind of back in the last five years and

197
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
sort of fine-tuned the each one of those

198
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,198
into becoming those six that are on the

199
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
website

200
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
okay gotcha

201
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,159
so when somebody decides to start

202
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
breeding right what are the first steps

203
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,400
i mean are they to identify

204
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
two different cultivars that they want

205
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,000
to cross or what are the first steps

206
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
here

207
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,959
absolutely so the first things you're

208
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,758
going to want to do is you're going to

209
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,038
find

210
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
like your two

211
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,959
well

212
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,800
it your two favorite plants whether

213
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,799
each each cultivar might be different

214
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,639
too like maybe you get

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
your favorite is in the female side or

216
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
your favorites in the male side but try

217
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
to have them both be your favorite and

218
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,280
you're going to have to grow regular

219
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,598
seeds in order for this to happen you're

220
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,679
not going to be able to grow

221
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,478
unless you you want to use a female

222
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
that's been grown from a feminized seed

223
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,680
so then you'd be able to utilize your

224
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
favorite female or something like that

225
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,918
as long as you know that that's

226
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,360
that's a pretty stable strain you could

227
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,799
probably use that as a good base

228
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,199
starting point

229
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,879
as long as it's one of your favorites

230
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,720
and then you're going to need regular

231
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,319
seeds in order to get your mail

232
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
so that's when you're going to make sure

233
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
that that's also one of your favorite

234
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,359
things too because if you start

235
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,879
combining

236
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
something that's not your favorite into

237
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,319
there or doing something that's not

238
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,840
going to work in your climate whether it

239
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
be

240
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,159
something that takes has a longer

241
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,720
growing period or isn't as resistant to

242
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,960
cold or things like that

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,199
and you add that into the mix on top of

244
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,519
even that nice maybe feminized female

245
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,919
seed that is your favorite

246
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,399
you're you're going to be sad so you're

247
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,318
always going to want to make sure that

248
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,719
everything you choose at the beginning

249
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
is your favorite and then everything

250
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
whatever whatever works for you and it

251
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,439
works make sure that you're choosing

252
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,879
that and each time jeez man um

253
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,519
and and you're going to have an okay

254
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
start you know but if you start throwing

255
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,120
things into the mix and just kind of

256
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,879
chucking pollen around and

257
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
and not really

258
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
and kind of getting away from the grand

259
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
vision of what you actually enjoy and

260
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,079
want to want to keep carrying on

261
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,000
that's when you're going to run into

262
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839
problems so if you're just getting

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,879
started choose things that are your

264
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,080
favorite

265
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,599
and

266
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,038
and make sure you continue to choose

267
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,320
those each time you breed but you're

268
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,519
going to start with two that are your

269
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,278
favorite

270
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
and and make sure that counts for the

271
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,838
mail too don't just chuck a pollen in

272
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
there just to create seeds

273
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
okay

274
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,480
i couldn't help but laugh your your cat

275
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,399
jumped up on your lap

276
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,039
i've got a cat on my lap too so it's

277
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,039
like pick up these cats that are laptops

278
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
anyways so the question i had actually

279
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,278
for that is

280
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
is it better to start with stable

281
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,879
genetics to begin with right so like say

282
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,319
somebody finds their prize pheno like

283
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,159
female but it's an f2 where f2s you know

284
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,080
we actually did a another episode where

285
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,000
we talk about what f1 is rf2 is they're

286
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,759
basically just different generations

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
generally speaking the further you go

288
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,958
down the more stable you kind of are

289
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
except for f2 it kind of opens up the

290
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,719
gene pool a little bit see more

291
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,639
characteristics so f2 is one of the

292
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
bigger ones as far as like the

293
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,958
characteristics you can potentially get

294
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,959
right so if you start with an f2

295
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,319
is that going to be less you know not as

296
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,159
ideal compared to if you're starting

297
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
with like an f4 and f5 something that's

298
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,278
more stable

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,879
well i guess it would depend on

300
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,720
what trade it was that you were looking

301
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,919
for and how important it was for you to

302
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,080
have that specific trait carried on over

303
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,039
because regardless of what you breed it

304
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,360
with

305
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,759
unless you're breeding like fellio which

306
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,720
is like breeding within

307
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,399
the actual like lines of like the family

308
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
genetics like breeding kind of like

309
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,879
brother and sister together um

310
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,278
as soon as you get outside of that

311
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,600
you're kind of starting all over again

312
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,838
so in some regard like i don't know if

313
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,040
that makes sense it does it does yeah

314
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,200
get a little bit too confusing but um

315
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,278
you know like

316
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
if you were to breed outside of the

317
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,480
family lines again yeah you're just

318
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,759
going to kind of start back over and

319
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,920
you've now created another f1 again

320
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,039
but it would assuming that the male is

321
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,479
outside but the um

322
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,919
it's always important to start with

323
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
stable genetics

324
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,078
uh regardless so

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
yes for the first one you always want to

326
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,958
start make sure you're using stable

327
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,720
genetics and not

328
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,719
again not kind of just chucking pollen

329
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
around and and making

330
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
things work like make sure both plants

331
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,958
are

332
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
are good

333
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,958
and and suit

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,000
what you want to see further on down the

335
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,159
line

336
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
while you do your fallen breathing to

337
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,039
kind of uh

338
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,159
um

339
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,480
really

340
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,879
pull out those traits and and solidify

341
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,278
them okay so what is meant by stable

342
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,919
genetics like in terms of a particular

343
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,240
stable genetics like when it only it

344
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,799
does exactly what you want it to so it's

345
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,159
it's if i wanted the plant to be purple

346
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,439
and grow

347
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,759
uh

348
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
one foot tall each time and have a

349
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,600
specific sort of flowering thing

350
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
um

351
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,800
and and a specific terpene profile and

352
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,958
uh things like that that would be a

353
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,799
stable genetic assuming that it did that

354
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,159
100 or very close to 100 of the time

355
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,519
um

356
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,199
you know i would say that it's pretty

357
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,399
stable if it's getting like 90 of the

358
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,640
time it's cool if you get a funny one in

359
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,720
there that still represents the plant in

360
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,159
the same way

361
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,320
like the genetics are supposed to but

362
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,759
maybe slightly different

363
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,760
but yeah stable genetics should be

364
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,000
something that's 100

365
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,759
or very close to 100 percent and

366
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,879
replicates the same thing almost like a

367
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,958
clone

368
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,919
okay so they have their two cultivars

369
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,439
right

370
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,240
they got their two cultivars that they

371
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
want to cross okay

372
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
let's say for the for this example you

373
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,800
have the male and the female of two

374
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,120
different different cultivars right yes

375
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,838
yep two different cultivars you want to

376
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,919
cross now oftentimes they're going to

377
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
first pheno hunt right so maybe they're

378
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,479
planting a batch of seeds you know 10

379
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,240
pack 20 pack whatever the amount of

380
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,680
seeds they're gonna plant then they're

381
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,079
hunting through looking for those traits

382
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,239
from that cultivar that they want to

383
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,000
then pass on to the kind of this new

384
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
hybrid right this because you have two

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,159
different cultivars that you're crossing

386
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
the end result would be a hybrid what do

387
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,078
you look for

388
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
in female plants we'll start with that

389
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,958
kind of what are the characteristics

390
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
that you're looking for in order to kind

391
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,399
of see if that's something a keeper that

392
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
you want to breed with i know it's

393
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
subjective it goes by breeder debris

394
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
there so for you what would you say you

395
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,799
kind of look for in female plants

396
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,078
um right so for me specifically again

397
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,879
this is something that would come back

398
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,519
to

399
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,679
uh whether or not that's some

400
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,399
that particular cultivar is stable or

401
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,599
not

402
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,120
right too when you're looking in it

403
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
because you'll be able to see like oh

404
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
all my all of it's looking

405
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
the same this obviously i'm working with

406
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
something that's good and if i

407
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,799
put this with with another stable

408
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
something else it's going to

409
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,078
they're going to combine and i'm going

410
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,838
to have to work with that in the future

411
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,719
and and hopefully both of them are good

412
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
so

413
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,360
when it's me looking for it in

414
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,120
particular and i'm working with genetics

415
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
that need to be resistant to frost

416
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,679
they've usually got i need them to

417
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,319
finish

418
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,319
probably at least by october 1st so

419
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,639
you're looking at a shorter growing

420
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,839
period than you than most people would

421
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,919
have

422
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
so i'm looking for things like fast

423
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,278
flowering time

424
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,480
um i'm looking for things like

425
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,240
resistance to white powdered mildew

426
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
how they how well they can handle the

427
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
cold also how well they can handle the

428
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
heat because it's still going to get hot

429
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,039
here too

430
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
so

431
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
those are some things i can replicate

432
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,600
but also a lot of that comes with

433
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,000
testing them outside as well

434
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
so both things have to happen and that's

435
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
also a way that you're going to find

436
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
whether or not your genetics are stable

437
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,600
and working environments if you get a

438
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,160
similar result growing inside and

439
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,159
outside

440
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,440
but those are some of the things that i

441
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,198
look for is

442
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
definitely a

443
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,599
short flowering time

444
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,240
resistance to cold white powdered mildew

445
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,278
resistance to insects

446
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,799
and then

447
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,879
after that

448
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,120
i look at

449
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,958
potency and things like

450
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
uh terpene profile and everything else

451
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,879
because if you can't eat the vegetable

452
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
or whatever it is at the end because

453
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,600
it's

454
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,198
it's all filled with bugs or the plant

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,560
was diseased and didn't finish it then

456
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,120
it's it's

457
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,479
it basically isn't any good anyway so

458
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
um

459
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
yeah all of those things come second to

460
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,198
me

461
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,240
but they still have to be top of the

462
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,078
line

463
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
so when you're growing out the females

464
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,278
are you cloning them prior to flipping

465
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,278
the flower and then grow completing the

466
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,078
female grow you have your clones on the

467
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,159
side and then you're you're picking one

468
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,958
and then you're you know keeping that

469
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,439
clone that you had or are you

470
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:25,039
growing them out then monster cropping

471
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,120
to bring it back into the veg stage

472
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,919
so i actually do neither of those things

473
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,120
i actually when i'm doing my breeding i

474
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,958
breed falil and i breed i'll put two of

475
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
them together two of my favorites and

476
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,559
then i'll work through those lines to

477
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
um

478
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,399
to create the stable genetics i don't

479
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,039
usually ever do any cloning or monster

480
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,879
cropping or things like that not because

481
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,919
i'm against it for any reason but i like

482
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,958
to start from each seed because i want

483
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,399
to make sure that each seed is

484
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,000
when it going to be the same whenever

485
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,320
somebody else grows it so i need to test

486
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,720
the stability that way but in terms of

487
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,639
breeding as well

488
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
yeah i always take

489
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
i always start from a seed and grow it

490
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,519
and make sure it

491
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,360
it

492
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
fits all the categories that i want it

493
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,720
to

494
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,959
and then i'll also grow my mail and i'll

495
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,639
have this growing at the same time so

496
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,359
that i can determine

497
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,680
um flowering times and things like that

498
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,639
between both of them both male and

499
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,039
female

500
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,399
so that i can see if that they're doing

501
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,439
the same things that i want so that

502
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,679
whenever

503
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,720
i breed those together it's going to

504
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,799
result in something similar down the

505
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
line as well as

506
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,519
combining traits together

507
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,560
that might be different but also work

508
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
together

509
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,559
so as the females are growing you're

510
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,559
actually you have a male growing

511
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,638
alongside and you're pollinating them

512
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,599
correct during that grow okay and then

513
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,879
you're growing them all out you're

514
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,879
smoking them and then you're picking

515
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,320
your your keeper from there and then

516
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,399
those you'll have seeds already

517
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,879
available for your keeper right

518
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,278
correct okay that makes sense yeah and

519
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,159
generally like when i'm

520
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,519
like

521
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,678
when you're starting with a stable

522
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,558
genetics usually you've already grown a

523
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
few

524
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,480
to to know that you that's something you

525
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
enjoy right like that's the main thing

526
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
you want to do before you even before

527
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
anybody ever decides like oh i'm going

528
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,279
to breed this one and i'm going to breed

529
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,199
this one

530
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,838
if you haven't even

531
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,600
grown it before

532
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,000
you you shouldn't even do it at all

533
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,399
because you need to do that first so

534
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,880
grow a bunch first and then find out

535
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
that you know that okay in this in this

536
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
cultivar in this

537
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
particular one i it has things that i

538
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
like so

539
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,879
you can go ahead and grow that because

540
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
when

541
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
if this is going to lead into probably

542
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
something we're going to talk about

543
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,678
later i'm sure in this video chris which

544
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,479
is when is a good time to

545
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,480
pollinate your female plant and when is

546
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,679
a good time to harvest your seeds

547
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,558
afterwards and how to get the best

548
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
result in that um

549
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,839
but yeah so that's that's part of the

550
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,919
reason why i do it that way too so that

551
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,879
they're at a particular stage of growth

552
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
both of them so that i can visually see

553
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
how the male is growing and and how the

554
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,679
female is growing

555
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,000
and usually i know how this plant works

556
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,240
and and in this particular cultivar

557
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,599
which you all should know if you're

558
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,038
going to get into this because you're

559
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,399
going to want to try to grow it to make

560
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,919
sure that it's what you want to do

561
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,120
before you start

562
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,400
because you're not going to be able to

563
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,519
smoke whenever you breed it is is what

564
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,759
we're going to get into talking about

565
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,679
later on pretty much

566
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,960
so you're going to waste the whole time

567
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,038
a whole plant

568
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
and two plants in fact depending on how

569
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,079
you do it because you're not going to be

570
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
able to smoke the pollinated female

571
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,439
because there's going to be way too much

572
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,639
seed depending on how you do it

573
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
gotcha

574
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,640
okay so flipping over to the male plants

575
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,079
side of things right so

576
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
like you mentioned that you're you're

577
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,359
you're combining the two i'm assuming

578
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,558
you're planting them all at once right

579
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,000
you're planting all these seeds you're

580
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,240
gonna you're gonna have your males and

581
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,798
you're gonna have your females

582
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,359
what do you look for in male plants for

583
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,359
selection

584
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,720
so

585
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
in male plants is much the same but it's

586
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,839
harder to

587
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,079
this is again where you're

588
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,519
you're kind of you're not guessing but

589
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,319
you're going to have a little bit of a

590
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,480
less

591
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,798
chance to determine for example like

592
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,640
terpene profile or

593
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,759
um

594
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,360
potency obviously or um

595
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,679
you know

596
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,199
uh flowering time you can tell like

597
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,880
those are those are that's the kind of

598
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,798
difference i mean because you can you

599
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
can watch the plant grow obviously but

600
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,839
you're not gonna be able to smoke it

601
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,359
you're not really it's not gonna have

602
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,359
the same smell that you're going to get

603
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,159
from a female that's produced the resin

604
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,678
and

605
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
and

606
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
anyways

607
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,120
you get you guys get where i'm going

608
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,399
with this so

609
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,079
um

610
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
what i look for when i'm doing it is

611
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,678
still the same way the flowering

612
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,080
structure is how close those node

613
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,519
spacing is together like if this is your

614
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,720
this is your plant right and each

615
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,240
knuckle is

616
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,160
where a new flower is going to begin

617
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
like how small is that space am i going

618
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,360
to get

619
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,158
tight branching flowers or am i going to

620
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,519
get flowers that are spaced far apart am

621
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,760
i going to get a different kind of

622
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,359
growth structure

623
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,319
is it going to be a bush is it going to

624
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,839
be

625
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,759
extra extra tall

626
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,759
or things like that and generally male

627
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,279
plants are usually more tall than female

628
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,279
because they're usually towering over

629
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,240
the plant and they want to spread their

630
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,480
pollen

631
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,519
down onto the plants so generally

632
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,519
males are almost always bigger but

633
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,918
that's not always sometimes not always

634
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,639
the case as well

635
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
so

636
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
you got to take that those sort of

637
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,440
things into consideration but those are

638
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,080
things i look for growth structure

639
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,159
flower spacing um

640
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,079
you know you can rub the stalk and get a

641
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,000
smell that way

642
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,759
and then the last thing would be just

643
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,599
like actual flowering time like how

644
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,759
quick does it take it

645
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,000
to start producing pollen and for those

646
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,359
pollen sacks to actually open up

647
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,880
because a lot of people don't know that

648
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,199
like you could have

649
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
a male well into flower and have all

650
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
kinds of pollen sacs but it's not

651
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
actually

652
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
it's hard to explain unless you've done

653
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,519
it before

654
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
but i'm sure that maybe maybe you've

655
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,639
seen it chris maybe other people have

656
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
seen it there too but it takes a long

657
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,038
time for those pollen sacks actually

658
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
open

659
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,119
for for though that pollen to be spread

660
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,319
around so you could have a male

661
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,719
you know

662
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,879
clearly it's a male for two three weeks

663
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,319
before you're into trouble

664
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,200
um

665
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,558
yeah

666
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,558
so those are things i look for growth

667
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,200
structure flowering time

668
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,720
and and flower node spacing when it

669
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,679
starts to produce those flower socks

670
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
because that's going to tell you how

671
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,038
that's going to translate into

672
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,200
your females flower spacing as well as

673
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,960
color obviously if it's got purple

674
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
leaves or it's got a purple stalk or

675
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,880
things like that okay

676
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,400
so i'm actually working on across i've

677
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
been using the brisker gmail with the

678
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
pakistan valley female

679
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,839
and you know one of the things that i'm

680
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,839
growing out the the f2s i grew in f2

681
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,519
recently it was a little more

682
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,079
stretchier than i wanted it to be a

683
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,480
little bit more right the bud stacking

684
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,240
wasn't as close together uh that i

685
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,240
wanted to be the you know internodal

686
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,839
spacing and things like that so yeah

687
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,279
that'd be the other term for yeah

688
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,759
talking about their like flowers and

689
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,158
whatever but so i'm i'm

690
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,919
so what i should probably look for and

691
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
give me guidance otherwise if you think

692
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,799
otherwise

693
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,360
is you know for males if i'm looking for

694
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,119
maybe the shorter males faster flowering

695
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,798
if i'm looking for you know just kind of

696
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,119
speed up the flowering so i can look for

697
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,960
that stem rub i've done stem rubs before

698
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,119
and kind of making sure that i get what

699
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,759
i want there lemony type smell is kind

700
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,359
of what i've chosen so far on it so i

701
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,879
want to make sure that's repeatable each

702
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,158
stem is going to have a different smell

703
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,679
but again you're

704
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,200
not going to get a huge variance but

705
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,798
it's going to be kind of specific to the

706
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,319
cultivar you're working with so if you

707
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,798
kind of know you're going to have an

708
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,960
idea right and should for males for

709
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,918
males should i also be looking at like

710
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,759
frost production on it or like coloring

711
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,759
at all like some i've had some males

712
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,960
that have you know the pollen sacks have

713
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,000
actually turned a little bit of purple

714
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,519
like purple in it are those things that

715
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
could potentially get passed on i know

716
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,359
we're going to get into dominant versus

717
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,558
recessive here in a minute or so you

718
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,918
know all those things can be passed on

719
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
absolutely all those things could get

720
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
passed on and uh yeah that's something

721
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
that i think is very cool is that the

722
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
dominant and recessive trade and the

723
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
talks about that and i'm sure there's a

724
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,038
lot of other people that have far more

725
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,798
knowledge on it than i do

726
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,359
um but it's something that i think is

727
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,759
very cool and is different

728
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,918
probably depending on which which plants

729
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,919
you're looking at as

730
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,440
as a whole as as just plants in an

731
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,919
entire species but

732
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,519
yeah is that is that purple that you

733
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,520
experienced in the flower going to get

734
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,038
passed on to

735
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,839
to the female

736
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,599
as

737
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,678
a dominant trait is it going to become

738
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,959
that all the time if you picked that

739
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,960
male for whatever reason or is that

740
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
are only going to show up sometimes is

741
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,278
going to be a recessive trait that's

742
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
sort of

743
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,759
locked into the gene pool but hidden so

744
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,480
you'll have to sort of look for it

745
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,359
throughout it um i don't know

746
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,120
so again i would assume that if that if

747
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,399
the purple thing is something that you

748
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,918
wanted

749
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,278
then yes that's something that i would

750
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,880
try to take into consideration when i

751
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:11,839
was looking for a male

752
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
um

753
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,119
recently i've been trying to do this

754
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
thing where i pulled on

755
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,359
like purple colors like per it has a

756
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
purple stock which is kind of unusual

757
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,319
and i wanted to pull that over and i was

758
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
having trouble and it seems that it only

759
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,240
shows up a certain time so you have to

760
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
be careful with that and i'm pretty sure

761
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,079
having a purple stock is a recessive

762
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,759
trait as where a purple leaf

763
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,599
it seems as soon as you breed a plant

764
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,079
that's got purple leaves with another

765
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,439
plant that's green the offspring all

766
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,839
seem to have

767
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,038
purple colorings of some sort

768
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,879
um

769
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,079
but not a purple stalk

770
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
so that's something i was trying to look

771
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,038
into and i'm not sure exactly how that

772
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,879
would

773
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:53,200
in your situation work with the purple

774
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
purple male you'd have to

775
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,400
try ultimately and if it was something

776
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
that you wanted to avoid then i would

777
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
not try

778
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,319
basically what it comes down to because

779
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,840
you don't want to add that into the gene

780
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,519
pool regardless of whether or not it's

781
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,959
dominant or recessive

782
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,119
because it means it could start showing

783
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,679
up in the future okay so after you've

784
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,439
selected your male and female let's talk

785
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,679
about the pollination process i know

786
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,200
you're outdoors you mentioned uh you're

787
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,480
referenced outdoors and how you're kind

788
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,080
of putting them together in the same

789
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,839
area do you have any tips for the

790
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,960
pollination process outdoors and then

791
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,319
indoors

792
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
i know there's people who like collect

793
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,839
pollen and then they'll pollinate at a

794
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,599
later date is there a certain day in

795
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,918
flowering where you feel it's kind of

796
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,278
best to pollinate in order to maximize

797
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,640
the yield of seeds that are created

798
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,079
okay so this is one of those things

799
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,520
where i'm testing the cultivars outside

800
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,079
to make sure that they're doing what i

801
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,359
want them to do and that's part of the

802
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,960
way that i test to make sure that

803
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,879
they're kind of the stable genetics or

804
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,919
whatever um but most of my breeding

805
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,880
happens inside so that i can make sure

806
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,240
that exactly what i want to get bred is

807
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,480
being bred and i don't have to worry

808
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,038
about again having pawn chucked around

809
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,640
or anything weird like that happening

810
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,359
i know exactly

811
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,840
which male is is mating with which

812
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,439
female because i know exactly which one

813
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,879
is pollinating the other one i know that

814
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
i don't have to really generally worry

815
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
about

816
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,839
cross-pollination or things like that

817
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,720
because i'm doing it in an enclosed

818
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,399
environment in a specific area

819
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,600
and if you've worked with pollen before

820
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,240
you know that

821
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,439
it it's quite easy to

822
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,200
breed them together each calyx each

823
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,519
each little hair on

824
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,159
on the plant can receive pollen from the

825
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,599
male and that will become your seed

826
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,600
and it's easy for that transfer to

827
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,439
happen but what a lot of people don't

828
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,399
know is that pollen can be extremely

829
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,720
volatile and it can become infertile

830
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
very quickly

831
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,839
so

832
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,440
generally what i like to do is i just

833
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,519
like to again this helps if you're

834
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
growing them side by side

835
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,879
and it helps if you're

836
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
got them in an enclosed area and you

837
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
only have the pair in there because

838
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,520
generally i'll grow them out and i'll

839
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,840
choose specifically which ones show the

840
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,240
traits the best that i want they might

841
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,720
all show the traits but i want the ones

842
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
specifically that show it the best

843
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,600
and that's what i'll put in my enclosed

844
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,519
area

845
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,199
when i go to pollinate i watch the males

846
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,278
see how long it takes for it to start

847
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,600
producing the pollen at this point in

848
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,200
time it's really easy to like you could

849
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,879
either take the male and shake it over

850
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
top of the female or

851
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
shake the female into it what's going to

852
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,000
end up happening is it's going to become

853
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,000
so pollinated anyways that

854
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,840
you're not going to be able to smoke it

855
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,519
but the idea is

856
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,678
because you've grown this cultivar so

857
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,798
many times or this or you should have at

858
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
this point

859
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,839
you'll know that the female that you've

860
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,360
chosen

861
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,359
is going to be okay and the male that

862
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,678
you've chosen is also going to be okay

863
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,199
because you have stable genetics so

864
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
when you go to

865
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,720
introduce your pollen however you choose

866
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,200
to do that

867
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
i like to do it basically

868
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,600
again as i said each

869
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,558
each calyx with this with the with the

870
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,319
hair can receive pollen and become a

871
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,678
seed so that's what you want to look for

872
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,158
in your female

873
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,480
as a good point in time to reference

874
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
when to pollinate because if your female

875
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,519
hasn't produced enough galaxies and have

876
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,360
enough hairs it's not going to produce

877
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,200
enough seed because you probably don't

878
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,359
want your male hanging around taking up

879
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,278
the space afterwards while your female's

880
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,199
growing

881
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,440
yeah so it's just i try to just

882
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,798
pollinate there and i always clip the

883
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
top butt off

884
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,519
and i keep it in a mason jar which goes

885
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,679
directly into the freezer labeled

886
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,038
again this is not the most ideal way to

887
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,559
store

888
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,879
male pollen but it's going to get you

889
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,398
about six months of storage

890
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,960
maybe a little bit longer if you put in

891
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,558
flour which like flour from from the

892
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,798
pantry flour because i've done that

893
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,038
before and it'll kind of absorb any

894
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:49,918
moisture because that's what's going to

895
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,038
make the pollen infertile or like not

896
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,880
allow it to

897
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,798
uh be viable to

898
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,880
to pollinate your females so it's not

899
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,639
really like a specific day in flower

900
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,720
where you're kind of aiming for it's

901
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,559
probably cultivar specific on to where

902
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,120
like you mentioned the there's enough

903
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,319
pistols kind of showing to pollinate and

904
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,158
have a good enough yield of seeds

905
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,599
yeah each one is going to be different

906
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,440
and again that's going to kind of play

907
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,439
into flowering time of your particular

908
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,080
cultivar um

909
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,798
but yeah if you have your male that's

910
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,398
ready to go and he's producing pollen

911
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,839
and he's ready to pollinate it depends

912
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,119
on how

913
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,278
that that's a good sign that one's

914
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,678
flowering quite fast compared to your

915
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,159
female if it if it's not

916
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,320
covered in doesn't have enough hairs

917
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,360
to receive the pollen in order to create

918
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:40,639
enough it depends on if you want 10 or

919
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,719
100 seeds right or a thousand seeds but

920
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,080
if you go too long

921
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,079
what can end up happening is that you

922
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,639
won't have enough time to actually allow

923
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,759
these seeds to mature

924
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
so

925
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,919
and then that also is a lost cause

926
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,919
because if they don't end up maturing

927
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,440
then you've wasted all this time

928
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,278
and then you don't have any seeds that

929
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,519
are viable at the end to actually plant

930
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,038
as well so that's where there becomes a

931
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,200
fine balance of

932
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,679
is it too early or is it too late it's

933
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,038
so it's always better to do it earlier

934
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,120
in the cycle

935
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,440
so that you can at least have a long

936
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,558
time for those to become

937
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,120
mature and viable as opposed to earlier

938
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,599
but if you go obviously too early it's

939
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,879
you're not going to get many seeds

940
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,319
and then you don't have a lot to play

941
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
with in the gene pool if you're working

942
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,599
on the early stages you're going to want

943
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,599
to have a lot of seeds and you don't

944
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,119
want to have go in with just 10 seeds

945
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,480
into a next generation isn't going to

946
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,479
give you a lot of

947
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,079
come on man don't get

948
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
isn't going to give you a lot of uh

949
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,439
pheno hunting to do for sure so you're

950
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,038
not gonna have a lot of options to

951
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,320
choose from going into the next ones

952
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,240
which is not something you want to set

953
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,960
yourself up with okay

954
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,000
so you've pollinated you're female how

955
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
long

956
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,240
uh should like when should you harvest

957
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,278
the plant in order to maximize the

958
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
amount of

959
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,880
yield you get of seeds right i mean

960
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:01,519
you know i know you don't typically

961
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,600
smoke the plants that you uh pollinated

962
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,440
and stuff like that so you just let the

963
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,719
plant go like

964
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,640
you know 9 10 11 weeks like further than

965
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
you typically would so you can kind of

966
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,278
make sure that the seeds are are

967
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,839
developed enough absolutely so

968
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,519
like we just talked about

969
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,278
i kind of like to hit that sweet spot

970
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,599
where i know i'm going to get quite a

971
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,398
large amount of seeds depending on

972
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:29,918
what stage of the process i'm in whether

973
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:33,038
it's creating a lot to be able to

974
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,759
bring this cultivar to the public or

975
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,599
am i just trying to create

976
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,960
like a small amount like 500 so that i

977
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,480
can work

978
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,840
through those 500 and pull out the

979
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,440
traits that i want to create the next

980
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,678
generation as i'm working to create it

981
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,399
more stable

982
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,320
so

983
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,558
if i'm trying to bring in

984
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,519
more seeds i'll just wait a little bit

985
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,519
longer

986
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,960
so that it has more hairs and the

987
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,599
flowers has just become a little bit

988
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,319
more developed but the main key is is

989
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,158
that you never want to pollinate without

990
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,639
having at least two months left because

991
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,278
it takes about eight weeks

992
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,080
roughly for a seed to mature at least

993
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,000
through

994
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,439
all the tests that i've done at least if

995
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,519
you leave yourself that much time

996
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,679
a flower or for at least the plant at

997
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,278
least two months of plants plant growing

998
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,159
whatever it is two months of plant

999
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,679
growing

1000
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,640
you're going to be okay

1001
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,200
um

1002
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,600
so yeah if your plant has a

1003
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,120
14 week flowering cycle or however long

1004
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,359
the flowering cycle is that'll buy you a

1005
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,439
little bit of time to

1006
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,798
push that calyx production a little bit

1007
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,440
further so that when you pollinate

1008
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,359
you'll get more seeds

1009
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
but there's not really any exact time

1010
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,879
other than the possibility that you

1011
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,880
could go too late

1012
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,480
and then afterwards like like you said

1013
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
earlier i just leave it until it's

1014
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,798
basically at the very end where it

1015
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,480
variant it's life can't push any more

1016
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,879
you can almost see the seeds want to

1017
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,679
fall out of the plant pretty much you

1018
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,840
could

1019
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,720
knock them off if you wanted to

1020
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:03,599
that's ideal because you're in my

1021
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,759
situation the plant's going to have over

1022
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,759
a couple thousand seeds on it i'm not

1023
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,278
going to pick through it to try to to

1024
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,480
smoke it i find the easiest way is

1025
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,720
actually throw the whole plant in a

1026
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,679
ziploc bag dry it a lot

1027
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,360
roll the whole thing up

1028
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,519
and then you'll be able to it'll

1029
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,319
basically like separate the seeds and

1030
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,000
the plant matter and then i've

1031
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,158
done tests before where you don't want

1032
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,558
to know you don't want to know the seeds

1033
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,159
far outweigh the plant matter and then

1034
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,119
you're like oh that was a lot of work

1035
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
for

1036
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,719
all this and well i guess now you get to

1037
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
enjoy the fruits of it afterwards

1038
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,798
depending on what you choose to do right

1039
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,480
but

1040
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,798
that's where it comes into play

1041
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,599
where you don't want to do that if

1042
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,759
you you number one aren't for sure that

1043
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,359
you want those seeds in the future

1044
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,000
and number two you aren't for sure that

1045
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,000
you'd enjoy smoking it and number three

1046
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,278
you better have some extra stash hanging

1047
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,038
around because

1048
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,240
if you don't have any other growth space

1049
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,119
and that's specifically what you're

1050
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,278
doing

1051
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,678
that harvest is going to kind of be a

1052
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,519
little bit of a sad time gotcha yeah

1053
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,600
that makes sense

1054
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,000
so after you

1055
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,878
pollinate you've harvested the seeds the

1056
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,719
offspring right f1 right that's an f1

1057
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,639
generation so we put your two favorite

1058
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,078
cultivars together like here in our

1059
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,760
beginning sample and we've created the

1060
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,720
f1 and so if you want to further

1061
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,800
stabilize that you could actually plant

1062
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,398
those and do the same process right you

1063
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
would just repeat the process you'd pick

1064
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,199
a female pick a male by showing your

1065
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,358
desired traits you would pollinate and

1066
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,239
then the offspring of that would be an

1067
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,358
f2 right yes and then so how far and

1068
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,959
that actually like i mentioned in the

1069
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,199
beginning that opens up the gene pool

1070
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,280
right so you get a greater variety in

1071
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,118
f2s yeah because you're going to get a

1072
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
mix of the two things that you just your

1073
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,838
two favorites

1074
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,200
you've now

1075
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,119
collided them together and you're going

1076
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,878
to get potentially the best of both

1077
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,559
worlds in this next generation that's

1078
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,319
what's going to happen here

1079
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,000
um

1080
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
and then it's and then it's up to you in

1081
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,599
that particular one you find your

1082
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,359
favorites again and you keep repeating

1083
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,280
and not so much if this is when it's

1084
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,319
really time to

1085
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,400
pick

1086
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,160
exactly what you want uh in terms of

1087
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,680
in terms of growth

1088
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,519
down the road and what you want to

1089
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,838
determine this plant's

1090
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:20,000
outcome to be um

1091
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,440
every time you know like you gotta

1092
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,719
choose this is what i want it to be

1093
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,760
every time

1094
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,519
and

1095
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,520
you're gonna see

1096
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:31,599
as you breed through f2 and f3 and f4

1097
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,679
um

1098
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
those choices that you made are going to

1099
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,919
start

1100
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,559
becoming more just dominant in the

1101
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,639
in the in the pool of pheno hunting each

1102
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,119
time you do it you're going to see

1103
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,239
oh my gosh it's it's way more purple

1104
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,119
than

1105
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,439
it was last time i picked two purple

1106
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,079
plants and now it's way more purple

1107
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
than before

1108
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,240
do you want to continue on the purple is

1109
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
is the question that you need to ask

1110
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,479
yourself as the breeder at this point in

1111
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,079
time or do you need to

1112
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,480
take a step back

1113
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,640
and and take away the purple um

1114
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,519
those are all questions that that kind

1115
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,960
of get into um

1116
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,719
in into what

1117
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,400
what kind of choices you

1118
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,519
like how how you want the plant to

1119
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,519
basically

1120
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,440
basically be when it's stable and what

1121
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,960
you want the end result to be okay so

1122
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,800
going down generations f3 f4 f5 become

1123
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,519
more and more stable

1124
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,200
at what point is the cultivar considered

1125
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,199
stable well it depends on

1126
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,679
on if you've thrown

1127
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,639
thrown it a genetic curve ball somewhere

1128
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:45,118
down the line or if each time you've

1129
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,519
been specifically selecting

1130
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,280
those traits and again that kind of

1131
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,759
uh again that thing i just said about

1132
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,240
purple like if you just like decided you

1133
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,359
wanted to do two purple ones for some

1134
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,519
reason

1135
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,679
you got a like a couple of purple ones

1136
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,199
in your f2 for whatever reason and for

1137
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,358
some reason you decided you wanted to

1138
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,799
breed those two together for whatever

1139
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,480
reason even though you were looking for

1140
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,400
a green cultivar and now in f3 you're

1141
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,320
like oh boy

1142
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,519
now like 75 of these are purple

1143
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
or more

1144
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,039
what it what does that mean like how am

1145
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
i going to get away from this i didn't

1146
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,719
want to have purple in my in my thing

1147
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,358
well you're going to have to

1148
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,519
take a step back go back to where you

1149
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:31,920
introduced that purple

1150
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,920
and and maybe even go step back further

1151
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,839
and and start from that seed pool like

1152
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,320
never get rid of your seeds so you can

1153
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,000
step back to the beginning generation

1154
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,960
and then start all over again so you

1155
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,199
never

1156
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,159
got into this purple scenario

1157
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,118
so that's why each each time if you want

1158
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,639
to be

1159
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,760
stable you're going to have to choose

1160
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,679
specific traits that you want to see and

1161
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,720
be very very picky

1162
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,480
about

1163
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,399
those traits especially in the first

1164
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,480
first one to three

1165
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,800
generations until they start seeing

1166
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,000
those traits repeated and when you start

1167
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
seeing them

1168
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,280
repeat it a little bit more you can kind

1169
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,039
of

1170
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,560
relax and then kind of fine tune that

1171
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,800
into maybe one or two more things that

1172
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,039
you want to see specific

1173
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,720
changes happen whether it's you want the

1174
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,759
plant to be a little bit bigger okay

1175
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,559
well

1176
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,560
pick one that has everything in it in in

1177
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,920
f in f4 for example you're like oh i

1178
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,920
want it to be just a little bit bigger

1179
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,119
now well that's would be a genetic curve

1180
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,159
ball that you're going to kind of throw

1181
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,920
it

1182
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,799
but if you make sure that it's not too

1183
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,400
far off like everything else is the same

1184
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,560
but it's a giant

1185
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,280
giant giant male but it still has a

1186
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,960
purple stalk or purple leaves and you

1187
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
want a purple for you want purple for

1188
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,440
this time it has purple stock purple

1189
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,639
leaves purple flower purple buds but

1190
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,480
it's giant

1191
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,639
pull that one in as your genetic curve

1192
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,320
ball because it won't be so weird in

1193
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,039
your in your

1194
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,119
in your next gene pool that hopefully

1195
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,759
you'll start seeing purple everything

1196
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,559
still not green but then there might be

1197
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,400
a few in there that are giant so then

1198
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,320
find the giant female

1199
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,680
and the giant male in your next

1200
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,480
generation

1201
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,838
to pull that giant part into your

1202
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,838
growing cycle

1203
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,319
yeah but but the idea is to be very

1204
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,160
specific in those first

1205
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,160
first generations to choose what you

1206
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,759
want because if you're not and you're

1207
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,598
just kind of

1208
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,640
doing willy-nilly like

1209
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,000
oh

1210
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,078
this is good then you're just going to

1211
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,599
get that whenever you go later on like

1212
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,920
your next generation again is just going

1213
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,519
to be kind of random because you're just

1214
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,440
doing random stuff

1215
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,440
but as long as you're very specific in

1216
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,760
choosing

1217
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,000
traits that you want

1218
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,480
to see represented throughout

1219
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,599
throughout the plants uh

1220
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,679
family tree then you're gonna be okay

1221
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,160
that's my two cents on that like as long

1222
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:58,159
as you as long as you continue to choose

1223
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,920
traits that that

1224
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,960
are what you chose at the beginning it's

1225
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,760
going to keep

1226
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,838
keep

1227
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,240
dominantly representing that could you

1228
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,119
consider an f3 stable or no that's too

1229
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,118
soon

1230
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,720
f3 is a little bit too soon i think it's

1231
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,119
i think it's f4

1232
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,279
for me when you really start to see

1233
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,680
uh the fruits of your labor sort of

1234
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,119
speak come in from the next from

1235
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,118
the past choices that you've made

1236
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,800
and then again but that's also a point

1237
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,480
where things could get screwed up where

1238
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,160
you could throw at that genetic sort of

1239
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,079
curveball and then you're kind of back

1240
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,399
into a spot where it's like

1241
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,560
that one was too different

1242
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,000
for whatever reason i don't know why

1243
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,679
because again things could be a little

1244
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,599
bit different in f3 or f4

1245
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,039
you might have one that just for some

1246
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,039
reason is a little bit different just

1247
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,318
different enough that it screws things

1248
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,920
up for you

1249
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,000
so then you might want to step back

1250
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,519
which would bring you into back crossing

1251
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,639
if you want to pull in the original

1252
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,559
things

1253
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,559
you used because you're kind of far away

1254
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,440
you could do that as well depending on

1255
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,400
how on how

1256
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,079
on on how far off you've you've done a

1257
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,559
genetic manipulation let's say

1258
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,640
you might want to go back

1259
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,799
gotcha okay

1260
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,719
let's talk about testing a little bit so

1261
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,318
oftentimes breeders will

1262
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,639
send out their seeds to a group of

1263
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,960
people you know for testing prior to

1264
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,799
releasing the seeds to the public right

1265
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,199
how many people should be testing these

1266
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,318
genetics before releasing to the public

1267
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,799
and do you have any kind of best

1268
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,239
practices i know that you know different

1269
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,920
cultivars are going to grow differently

1270
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,519
in different latitudes like are you

1271
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,599
doing anything like that to where you're

1272
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,440
making sure it's shipped out different

1273
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,720
areas so people are growing in different

1274
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,079
areas to kind of see what's going on

1275
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:42,959
absolutely

1276
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,200
yeah

1277
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,000
okay so yeah for us absolutely i try to

1278
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,759
ship

1279
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,039
stuff to the east coast and stuff to the

1280
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,319
west coast

1281
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,079
just to make sure because they're

1282
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,159
entirely different growing environments

1283
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,560
but i want to make sure that you get the

1284
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,159
same in this in this

1285
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,358
in this scenario you want to make sure

1286
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,279
that i'm getting the same kind of

1287
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,719
i want the plant to be purple first

1288
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,240
we're just going to keep going to this i

1289
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,118
want the plant to be purple for whatever

1290
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:12,078
reason um but yeah if i ship it to both

1291
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,000
sides it better be purple

1292
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,160
you know it better grow right but it

1293
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
better be purple regardless of what spot

1294
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,838
it's in because that shouldn't make a

1295
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,440
difference on the color of the plant

1296
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:22,880
really

1297
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,920
again there are some things that could

1298
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,920
come into play whether it's

1299
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,200
weather or location or things like that

1300
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,680
but that

1301
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,719
it then becomes not part of the gene

1302
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,199
pool and we're not talking about

1303
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,199
breeding at that point um i want the

1304
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,279
purple to be genetic part of the plant

1305
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,239
not brought on by the weather or

1306
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
something like that right

1307
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,440
so yes i ship things across to both

1308
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,838
sides of the border unfortunately i

1309
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,159
can't ship things to the states or i'd

1310
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,440
haven't really had a good

1311
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,118
figured out a good way to do that yet

1312
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,880
that i feel safe about doing it then i

1313
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,400
could start going down that road but

1314
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,480
otherwise it's really easy for me to do

1315
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,000
it in here in canada

1316
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,880
and then like again if you're talking

1317
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,358
about how many seeds to grow

1318
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,119
this is kind of brings you to that stage

1319
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,880
we were talking about it earlier on in

1320
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,318
the video where we're talking about how

1321
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,200
many seeds are you going to get from a

1322
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,920
plant

1323
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,239
so

1324
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,000
if you only got 10 seeds that's not a

1325
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,000
very good spot to start

1326
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,280
because

1327
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,719
you're not

1328
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,119
you're not going to get a good enough

1329
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,480
example from those 10 seeds so you're

1330
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,440
going to have to choose the best out of

1331
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,199
the 10

1332
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,119
and then i would start all over but that

1333
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,960
would never be

1334
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,838
i wouldn't even call that an f1 at that

1335
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,079
point

1336
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,400
even though it is

1337
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,039
you just you have too little of amount

1338
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,240
of seeds to actually determine what

1339
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,159
genes or

1340
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,759
things could be found in the gene pool

1341
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,799
anyways

1342
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,440
so let's say for this example you have

1343
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,440
a thousand seeds

1344
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,400
let's say you have a thousand seeds you

1345
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,400
counted them

1346
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,079
i've done it before it's annoying they

1347
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,680
probably make seed counter things but

1348
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,039
i've counted it before

1349
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,000
um

1350
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,279
if you grow i don't know well i guess if

1351
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
you grew a hundred of them then you

1352
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,040
would have grown ten percent of the seed

1353
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,519
lot right

1354
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:13,039
and that would give you a good

1355
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,920
good chance to see

1356
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:18,960
like a very like a good display of

1357
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,720
what's going on within your gene pool

1358
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,639
even though it's only 10 percent it's

1359
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,799
100 seeds it's going to give you a good

1360
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,960
idea of what's happening

1361
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,640
throughout the remainder of the seeds

1362
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,838
i probably would go a little bit further

1363
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,559
to say if you did 150 15 depending on

1364
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,838
how

1365
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,199
um

1366
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,759
you know how crazy you wanted to get

1367
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,039
with things you could test maybe 200 do

1368
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,800
20

1369
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,639
but i think the 10

1370
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,200
somewhere in the 100 to 200 range is

1371
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,639
going to give you a good idea of what

1372
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,118
what's going to happen with the rest of

1373
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,199
the seeds and what what is available in

1374
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,680
the gene pool anyways are you sending

1375
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,919
out to testers each generation are you

1376
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,559
doing f1s and then sending out testers

1377
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,800
f2 sending are you like finding what you

1378
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,559
want and then sending out it like

1379
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,839
f4 f5 yes yeah like i'll do pretty much

1380
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,039
all the work

1381
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,119
like let's say 90 of the testing but the

1382
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,960
final amount of the testing is when i

1383
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,760
need to have that bulk amount of seeds

1384
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,920
grown that i can't do quite by myself

1385
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
you know whether it's having a hundred

1386
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,519
done at once of one thing so that i can

1387
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,720
make sure that it's good to go

1388
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,480
um

1389
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,838
it's not that i can't do it but i have

1390
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,519
other things happening too at the same

1391
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,358
time that it's hard to

1392
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,519
do

1393
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,480
to just drew as anyone would know it's

1394
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,000
hard to just grow a hundred of one thing

1395
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,199
so it's not that i don't want to do it

1396
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,079
myself but what it also allows is to see

1397
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
if

1398
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,920
other people's growing methods or other

1399
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,520
people's growing environments or things

1400
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,559
like that affect the traits that i've

1401
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,318
chosen

1402
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,480
and how they interact with each other

1403
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,000
and whether and how they interact with

1404
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,240
the the cultivar interacts with the

1405
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,239
grower the environment all those things

1406
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,639
so no i don't send out previous

1407
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,039
generations but i send out the specific

1408
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,239
thing that i'm kind of

1409
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,639
the one that i think is one

1410
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,879
when i fine-tuned it all the way that's

1411
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,199
the one that i send out to kind of have

1412
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,400
be mass tested at the time to make sure

1413
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,480
that it is

1414
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,119
the one and then i can go okay and then

1415
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,199
i'll do one more breeding of exactly

1416
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,160
those specific traits folial in that

1417
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,838
same

1418
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,440
with that cultivar that i've had

1419
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,279
everyone test

1420
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,119
and then usually in that next one which

1421
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,920
will probably be like an f6 or f5

1422
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,760
depending on how i'm doing on if i've

1423
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,920
been lucky or

1424
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,920
i've i've worked working with cultivars

1425
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,400
that are very generous to me in that in

1426
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,440
that regard

1427
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,519
then yeah it could be an f6 i'll i'll

1428
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,679
make the f5 that everyone's tried and

1429
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,159
then that'll be the one that

1430
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,960
that gets put on the website

1431
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,639
and

1432
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,679
you could pick up and it's probably

1433
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,279
going to be

1434
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:59,039
90 the same at that point got it all

1435
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,440
right i think that was a pretty good

1436
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,159
recap of kind of how to get started with

1437
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,838
breeding and stabilizing and definitely

1438
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,679
covered a lot in a short amount of time

1439
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,519
so appreciate you dropping the knowledge

1440
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,118
this time around tell us how can little

1441
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,759
students find you and what do you have

1442
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,920
upcoming in the future um well in the

1443
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,000
future right now i'm working on uh

1444
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,440
breeding in an autoflower and a photo

1445
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,400
period together which i know is

1446
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,318
something we didn't get a chance to

1447
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,760
touch on in this video chris but

1448
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,519
sometime in the future maybe we can chat

1449
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,200
about that um

1450
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,119
so that's what i'm working on right now

1451
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,039
i'm probably at the fourth generation

1452
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,960
and i'm just starting to see

1453
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,480
some autoflower traits come in but i've

1454
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,400
also got some other cool things like

1455
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,079
trifoliate going on which is kind of

1456
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,318
when you get an extra chromosome put in

1457
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,400
but this is getting into like way extra

1458
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:46,000
breeding stuff so maybe another time

1459
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,559
around um but in that meantime i'm just

1460
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,199
working on that i'm fine tuning it

1461
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,720
before i even get to sending that i've

1462
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,078
got to make sure they're all autoflower

1463
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:55,679
which is kind of the cool part about

1464
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,559
that it's a whole different

1465
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:57,919
uh

1466
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,079
different ball game because you're

1467
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,079
changing the actual flowering

1468
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,200
the way the way the plant responds to

1469
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,400
light

1470
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,879
which is cool

1471
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,119
so i'm working on that and uh other than

1472
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
that you can just find me again at the

1473

1479
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,599
as you know i'm up in

1480
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,358
in canada so it's winter time and i'm

1481
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,720
taking it easy pretty much

1482
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:29,598
so uh

1483
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,919
yeah

if you guys are in canada get in touch

1485
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,119
and i'd love to send you some seeds if

1486
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,118
you're not i'm sorry i can't but maybe

1487
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,640
in the future sweet well i'll definitely
