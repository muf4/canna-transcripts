MJ Coco how you doing today I'm doing

00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,379
good and I'm excited to be on the show

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,299
I'm excited to have you on the show we

44
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,699
actually met a few months back at MJ

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,460
bizcons so we had a little face-to-face

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,320
in person and we talked about you coming

47
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,819
on the podcast and we talked about

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,438
something doing something a little bit

49
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,898
different I've never done this before we

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,898
actually do back-to-back episodes with

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,920
Dr MJ Coco so I mean your knowledge on

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,239
both Coco and led are just extensive and

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,978
I didn't really want to merge that into

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,478
one episode so I figured hey let's do an

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,819
episode on Coco then the next episode

56
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,319
will be on LED and it'll be back to back

57
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,818
so I'm really excited for this one I

58
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,359
think the audience is gonna like it as

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,639
well cool I'm excited for it yeah you

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,140
know there are two of the sort of things

61
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,719
that I've devoted a lot of time and

62
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,458
energy I started off you know in this

63
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,020
space really talking about growing in

64
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,659
Cocoa

65
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,760
um and a few years ago I got heavy into

66
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,318
researching lights and doing the grow

67
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,479
light calculator and all of that so

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,539
that's really where a lot of my passions

69
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,119
been for the last few years but yeah

70
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,500
it's it's fun I'm excited to just to be

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
able to explore both sides of that with

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,060
you cool so the way I like to start all

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,800
episodes is really with an introduction

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,180
so can you tell us a little bit about

75
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,700
yourself and kind of how you got into

76
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,300
gardening yeah so

77
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,579
um I have a PhD I actually study

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
um economic and agricultural

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,780
anthropology I work primarily with

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,760
farmers in Central America and southern

81
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,519
Mexico

82
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,598
um peasant farming communities and

83
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,959
understanding sort of how how they

84
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,399
manage livelihoods to put a very simply

85
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,019
so how they do their agricultural

86
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,420
production and how they sort of make a

87
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,640
living for themselves

88
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,579
um that got me you know as an

89
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,500
undergraduate and as a graduate student

90
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:27,540
doing Horticulture and botany classes

91
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,699
especially in in grad school I started

92
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,120
doing sort of more specialized

93
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,098
horticulture and agricultural classes to

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,840
understand it and to be able to to sort

95
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:39,719
of work with Farmers so understanding

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,598
both the the you know Horticultural and

97
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,000
Botanical side of agricultural and crop

98
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,859
production and doesn't understand the

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,400
economics and and a lot of the social

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,540
dimensions of of that

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,420
um as a grad student I was one of the

102
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,340
supervisors of the the university

103
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,919
organic garden so

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,259
um you know we had a cool organic garden

105
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,780
students could get little plots to to

106
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,878
take care of we had some research going

107
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,919
on out there and we had some classes

108
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,298
that had part of the the garden where

109
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,759
they were doing things I actually taught

110
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,879
a class on small-scale food production

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,639
in my garden later on

112
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,259
um so you know in terms of of that

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
background and then I went and did my my

114
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,699
research and

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,478
um you know lived in communities of

116
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,600
farmers for about two years

117
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,478
um doing my dissertation research

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
um got really

119
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:41,159
hands-on experience working in those

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,660
kinds of of communities but still all

121
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,979
dealing with with you know other kinds

122
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,960
of crops I mean those Farmers grew

123
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:48,478
primarily the muscle American Trilogy

124
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,719
corn beans and squash

125
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,300
um and you know a few other crops around

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,580
the edges of that

127
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,660
um working in the in the gardens growing

128
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,758
you know all sorts of fruits and

129
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,259
vegetables and things like that and here

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,040
in Southern California were a lot of

131
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:08,639
different fruits and vegetables can grow

132
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,900
um and you know it was actually in grad

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:16,319
school that um I was recommended medical

134
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,839
for my arthritis my my rheumatologist

135
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,240
actually and that that sort of brought

136
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,819
me into

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,000
that dimension of horticulture

138
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,978
um but I've been studying kind of

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,800
horticulture and working with Farmers

140
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:34,139
for for years leading up to that awesome

141
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,780
so lots of good stuff in your background

142
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,400
in regards to gardening and farming and

143
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,379
even on the Consulting side of things

144
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,019
and teaching people which is really

145
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,600
really cool yeah yeah I've always liked

146
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,418
to teach you know one of the the great

147
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,280
things about sort of moving into this

148
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,120
space in particular is all of our

149
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:57,478
students are really interested to learn

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,300
um I teach University classes too and

151
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,599
then you know University students are

152
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,220
primarily interested in getting a grade

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,199
um and most of them will do what they

154
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,220
have to do in order to get the grade but

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,038
they're not really interested in

156
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,160
learning the material

157
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:17,038
and so dealing with Growers who are

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
growing plants and whether they're sort

159
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,279
of you know commercial scale Growers

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,560
they do Consulting work with they're

161
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,500
small home Growers that just have a

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,879
couple of plants in a tent in their room

163
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,860
they want to learn I mean they don't

164
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,538
give a crap about doing well on the test

165
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,340
they need to make sure that they Master

166
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:38,000
the material and like from a teacher's

167
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,318
perspective it's so much more like

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,259
joyous to teach students that are

169
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,600
motivated by learning rather than sort

170
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,400
of just motivated by grades

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,020
um which is really I want to learn as

172
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,879
little as possible and still get the

173
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,038
grade that I think I deserve that's sort

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,899
of the mindset behind that you know and

175
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,759
then there's this other cohort in in

176
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,079
universities that are are just there

177
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,060
because they don't know what else to do

178
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,439
with themselves at that age and time in

179
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,639
their life and they were always told you

180
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,918
know this is the next thing you're

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,840
supposed to do so they can go there sort

182
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,339
of somewhat mindlessly I mean the number

183
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,339
of students in your standard university

184
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:15,000
they're actually primarily motivated by

185
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:17,159
learning it's like five percent and you

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,339
love them when you get those students in

187
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,939
like a regular University class but yeah

188
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,698
as you know Dr MJ Coco I would say it's

189
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,319
the obviously like 95 of the students of

190
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,740
the people that come and that I interact

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,660
with are really anxious to sort of gain

192
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,160
access to the knowledge that's so cool

193
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,180
yeah I can imagine that makes your job a

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,599
little bit easier

195
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,120
it's so much more fun yeah you're not

196
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,038
sort of force-feeding people stuff and

197
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,478
like this is important is it going to be

198
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,939
on the test yes it's going to be on that

199
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,240
it's just what he wants to teach like

200
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:54,839
that all right so let's get into growing

201
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,960
in Coco coir and I guess first thing is

202
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,698
to talk about the uh pronunciation I

203
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,560
want I used to say Coco core and

204
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,139
somebody had corrected me and they're

205
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,819
like actually it's Coco coir and I

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,800
looked it up I looked on Google and

207
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,319
looked at pronunciation and blah blah

208
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,240
blah and found out they were correct I'm

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,419
not going to do the pronunciation police

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,918
and say nobody should say Coco core but

211
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,598
I thought it was worth mentioning that I

212
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,418
guess that the proper way to say it is

213
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,360
actually Coco coir you know I'm also a

214
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,339
linguist and I'm more of what we would

215
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,500
call a descriptive linguist than a

216
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,000
prescriptive linguist so you're talking

217
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,560
more like a prescriptive language like

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,418
there's a correct way to do things and

219
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,799
we should all follow that Norm and this

220
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,120
is the prescription for how you're

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,918
supposed to talk that sounds like you're

222
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,320
high school English teacher taught

223
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,778
English right like there's a proper

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,200
pronunciation or proper grammar and all

225
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:47,700
that stuff most linguists that study

226
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,680
real language they they're they're

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,440
descriptive so they'll they'll describe

228
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,719
what people are actually doing rather

229
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,420
than pontificate about sort of what they

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,759
should do but they don't you know like

231
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:02,099
ending a sentence with a preposition or

232
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,259
something like that you know your

233
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,019
English teacher is likely to give you a

234
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,759
prescriptive rule but you go out and

235
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,620
like listen to how people actually talk

236
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,500
in the world and most of them break

237
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,459
those rules all of the time so with this

238
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,200
one in in particular yeah they're I'm

239
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:23,099
willing to accept different

240
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,580
is sort of pronunciations on it

241
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,420
um but I guess

242
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,820
chewing closely to sort of the the

243
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:36,059
origin it would be coir

244
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,500
um but I don't know I'm often guilty of

245
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,939
just pronouncing things that the way

246
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,458
that they're written especially on

247
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,519
scripts I did that quite famously in my

248
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:48,000
how to buffer Coco video or not only do

249
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,879
I call it Coco core but and and I know

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,860
better than this I I said

251
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:57,958
um education instead of ion but it's

252
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,940
like almost impossible for me not to do

253
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,979
that well it is now because I'm sort of

254
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,100
been pounded with that but I was reading

255
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,320
it so reading that word written I just

256
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm very tempted to pronounce it and

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,899
actually since my background in Spanish

258
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm very

259
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:15,179
tempted to pronounce it according to

260
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,278
Spanish pronunciation rules oftentimes

261
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:21,659
um that's funny well Tomatoes Tomatoes

262
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,458
right yeah and tomatoes Tomatoes

263
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,860
um and what's really actually

264
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,018
interesting is from a Linguistics

265
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,759
perspective I think it's watching how

266
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,539
language does change and how particular

267
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:36,360
people influence that language change so

268
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,879
us talking about whether it's Coco core

269
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,339
or coco coir or however you want to

270
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,899
pronounce it has some influence on you

271
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,720
know how other people then go about

272
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,679
talking about it very true so what is

273
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,459
Coco coir it's just coconut husk okay so

274
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:56,039
it's like the the brown husk of the the

275
00:10:53,458 --> 00:11:00,000
coconut fruit

276
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,439
um which is dried and then ground into

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,159
pieces

278
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,279
um and there's basically three different

279
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:11,458
types of of cocoa you'll get like the

280
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:15,720
fine particles that are almost like dust

281
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,879
um which we call peat it's cocoa Pete

282
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,399
um and then you can have the fibers

283
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,399
which are like these stringy things

284
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,240
which are the cocoa fibers and then you

285
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,240
get like chips which are

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,539
like less broken down still hunks of the

287
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,560
the coconut husk basically

288
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:40,199
um the the chips have the best uh air

289
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,078
holding capacity

290
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,820
um although the fiber holds on to a lot

291
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,679
of air too so if you have a higher

292
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,278
enough concentration of fiber you'll

293
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:54,539
have a good air holding capacity the the

294
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:57,899
peat or the dust holds on to more water

295
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:02,399
um and less air so it you know you want

296
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:05,519
to have a blend of peat fiber and chips

297
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,578
when when you're growing and through the

298
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,000
course of time the the chips will break

299
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:13,799
down into fiber and pee and the peat

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,700
breaks down into smaller and smaller and

301
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:21,059
smaller pieces of peat basically a lot

302
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:24,000
of that's caused by root action

303
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,778
um we don't want to grow in cocoa that

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,539
has too much of the finest peat so

305
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,700
oftentimes we'll rinse it

306
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,980
um through a colander or another screen

307
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,440
or a sieve or something that that lets

308
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,899
the the finest particles sort of rinse

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,640
out and keeps the larger particles

310
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,559
behind

311
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,278
um and and doing that you can actually

312
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,239
recycle cocoa

313
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,399
indefinitely

314
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,259
um because

315
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,539
you're sort of getting rid of the oldest

316
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,458
cocoa that's broken down the most each

317
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,259
time and you'll have to add more cocoa

318
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,078
on the top but

319
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,000
um I recommend Growers do that with

320
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,979
their with their cocoa grows there's no

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,078
reason to sort of throw it out and get

322
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,820
new cocoa okay and then when you get

323
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,299
cocoa you can either get it in like a

324
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,100
brick form or a bagged form those breaks

325
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,439
of cocoa are compressed just like like

326
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,659
the brick used to be compressed and it's

327
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,120
kind of a lower quality but you can

328
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:24,059
rehabilitate it to a large extent

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,019
um the the bricks have a generally a

330
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:31,439
larger proportion is dust so a larger

331
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,299
proportion is the finer particles and I

332
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,820
always recommend rehydrating it and

333
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,979
rinsing it through a screen

334
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,079
um and you'll yield less you're gonna

335
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,579
lose a lot of that dust that's kind of

336
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,919
the point

337
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,439
um but you'll end up with a pretty good

338
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,219
quality cocoa if you end up if you sort

339
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,820
of do that the bags

340
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,160
the bags usually have more chips and

341
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,980
more fiber sort of a larger particle

342
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,319
size

343
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:05,300
and you know you yield more from the bag

344
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,278
the bags are often also pre-buffered so

345
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:10,979
in theory you could use it sort of right

346
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,740
out of the bag there aren't a lot of

347
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,899
brands of cocoa that I trust right out

348
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,000
of the pack so I almost always end up

349
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,299
processing my cocoa to some extent

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,778
before using it even if I buy sort of an

351
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:27,059
expensive bagged cocoa but the the

352
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:29,399
processing is certainly less than it

353
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:32,219
would be with a brick which you have to

354
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,039
go to several steps and you rehydrate

355
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,800
then you rinse it through a screen then

356
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,958
you do a couple buffering soaks then you

357
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,240
drain it off then you rinse down the

358
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,659
residual EC so you don't burn your plant

359
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,519
roots and all of that you know it takes

360
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,879
time

361
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:55,019
um a couple of days so the bag process

362
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,698
oftentimes you know some Bag products

363
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,139
good bag products I'll just put in a pot

364
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,939
and run some water through it to

365
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,680
saturate it and test the EC of the water

366
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,540
that's coming out and as long as that's

367
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,179
low enough I'll Trust the cocoa

368
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,039
basically sometimes you have to run more

369
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,899
water through it some products I'd

370
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,120
recommend doing a buffering soak and

371
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,100
then rinsing it down but generally

372
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,860
there's just less work to do to get them

373
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:20,339
prepared they cost more money

374
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,839
um so you know each individual grower

375
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,579
needs to sort of put their own

376
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,380
drudgery to cost index which is actually

377
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,479
one of the things that I study with my

378
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,698
my Farmers

379
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,220
um it's like how much drudgery are you

380
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:37,679
willing to invest in this and how much

381
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,040
of you know is just spending an extra 20

382
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,198
40 60 80 bucks and you know with that

383
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,519
drudgery are you willing to to pay to

384
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,838
avoid yeah the the rehydrating rinsing

385
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,578
and buffering of the bricks is

386
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,100
definitely time consuming I've done that

387
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:55,019
uh a handful of times and I personally

388
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,639
prefer buying the bagged cocoa now to

389
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,320
avoid that process but you can imagine

390
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
being in a different financial position

391
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,339
and being like I don't know I got time

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,919
to burn and I do not have any money so

393
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,380
you know there's there's different sort

394
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,078
of people are at different points of

395
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:12,000
that continuum absolutely let's get

396
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,500
deeper into the rinsing and buffering

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
because I know there's quite a few

398
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,860
people who have no idea what that is I

399
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,500
don't know how many Growers have hit me

400
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,419
up over the years with problems of the

401
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,440
plant showing problems there in cocoa

402
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,659
and ask them if they've rinsed their

403
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,760
buffer and they're like What's that so

404
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,100
talk to us about rinsing and buffering

405
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,360
why is it important and how do you go

406
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,980
about doing that I know you have a

407
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,659
really good good video on it so you can

408
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,759
keep it pretty brief and we'll refer

409
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,198
people to that video but yeah if you can

410
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,399
kind of give us an overview here that'd

411
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,799
be great yeah so Coco we talked a little

412
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,480
bit about the dust and particularly in a

413
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,039
brick of cocoa it's going to have more

414
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,699
dust than you want so you're going to

415
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,819
want to rinse that dust out rinsing is

416
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:56,219
largely just about sort of getting rid

417
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,839
of the smallest particle sizes you're

418
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,300
also going to knock some of the sodium

419
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,180
out of of the cocoa if it comes with

420
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:09,058
sodium but most of that's going to be

421
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,659
bound in in a you know a cation Bond

422
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,959
um

423
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,839
and you're not going to really deal with

424
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,179
that until you buffer so buffering is

425
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,458
the next step so rinsing I just rinse

426
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,500
through a literally a colander or a

427
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,298
sieve a screen and get rid of the

428
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,099
smallest particles

429
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,418
um collect that and you don't want to

430
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,859
rinse it too thoroughly either you don't

431
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,540
want to get rid of all of the P because

432
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,539
the peat is really what holds the water

433
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,940
but you don't want it to just be sort of

434
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,139
swimming in in the smallest particles

435
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,880
and you'll see this when you start

436
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,299
rinsing it out there's like the water

437
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,100
that comes out is brown and after you

438
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,079
know just a few seconds it's no longer

439
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,379
Brown and that's fine you don't need to

440
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,418
sort of like keep rinsing it out

441
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,559
um then you want to put it in a strong

442
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:58,679
solution of Cal Mag calmag and iron and

443
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,918
sure but primarily calcium magnesium

444
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,100
um which are both double charged cations

445
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:08,640
and you know we talk about cocoa being

446
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,558
sort of an inert growing media and and

447
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,660
that's one of the things that we really

448
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,000
like about cocoa I would actually argue

449
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,919
that the air water ratio is a is a

450
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,859
better selling point of cocoa than just

451
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,980
the inert aspect of it

452
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,899
um but it is pretty inner in in that it

453
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,000
doesn't interact with the nutrient water

454
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,559
that we're providing it doesn't interact

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,779
with the nutrients it just kind of like

456
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,178
sits there like a sponge and holds the

457
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:36,538
water but doesn't engage in exchanges

458
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:41,519
with them the one exception to that is

459
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:44,879
Coco comes sort of naturally with some

460
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:49,379
single charged cations that it will give

461
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,720
up and it take double charged cation out

462
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,480
of the solution

463
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,880
and that cation exchange you know

464
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,720
generally Coco comes with some sodium

465
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,760
and some potassium so

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,759
um okay

467
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,740
um cations that are sort of already part

468
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,798
of the cocoa

469
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,599
um and in the presence of calcium or

470
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,599
magnesium

471
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:18,178
the cocoa will release that sodium and

472
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,399
and that phosphor sorry the potassium

473
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,059
and grab onto the calcium or the

474
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Magnesium it creates really strong bonds

475
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:30,720
with the calcium or the magnesium and

476
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,939
it's unlikely in any situation to

477
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,620
release those calcium and magnesium I

478
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,500
often get this question like once it's

479
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,659
buffered is that like those come on

480
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,099
Exchange sites are buffered they have

481
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,980
their calcium they're happy they're

482
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:46,859
basically taken out of the equation you

483
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,019
can do almost anything that cocoa at

484
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:52,740
this point and and not cation exchange

485
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,759
site will not give up its calcium cation

486
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,640
um

487
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,379
however so one of the things that we do

488
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,538
with buffering is we're just trying to

489
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,059
get as many of those exchanges to take

490
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,419
place as possible before adding plans

491
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:09,058
right so we take this cocoa that's got

492
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:12,179
this potassium and the sodium and we

493
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:15,599
soak it in really strong cow mag water

494
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,519
basically and it releases all the

495
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,319
potassium and the sodium and grabs on to

496
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,859
the calcium and magnesium and once it

497
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:25,980
does that it's it's considered buffered

498
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,798
um if we don't do that in advance and we

499
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,660
use unbuffered cocoa and I don't know if

500
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,418
you've ever had the The Misfortune of

501
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,460
using really unbuffered cocoa but it

502
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,780
will stock all the calcium and magnesium

503
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,819
out of your plants and it's almost

504
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,740
impossible to sort of keep up with

505
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,678
because the cocoa will get the calcium

506
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,019
magnesium before the plants can get it

507
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,120
and almost no matter how much you

508
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,220
provide you're never going to provide

509
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,019
sort of enough to get out of that

510
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,798
deficit

511
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,720
um

512
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,179
if you do a good job buffering before

513
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,819
using the cocoa you can definitely keep

514
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,880
up with the Cal Mag requirements during

515
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:05,099
the rest of the grow they never fully go

516
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,280
away and and that's important to sort of

517
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:11,038
understand remember we have cocoa chips

518
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,839
and and cocoa peat

519
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,359
um and the cocoa fibers that are sort of

520
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,579
constantly breaking down largely due to

521
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,038
root action of the plants that we're

522
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:23,519
growing so as the plants themselves grow

523
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:26,759
through they break apart the cocoa and

524
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,460
that exposes new cation sites and that

525
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,158
exposes sort of new potassium and sodium

526
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,919
that the plants wanting to release and

527
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,559
grab onto the calcium and magnesium so

528
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,620
the cocoa is always a little thirsty for

529
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:44,639
calcium magnesium and in Cocoa we always

530
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:48,178
sort of provide a bonus dose which is

531
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,780
not for the plant it's really for the

532
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:54,480
cocoa itself the other thing to sort of

533
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:57,298
be aware of with Coke go is we're almost

534
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,179
always running high in K and that's

535
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:02,038
because the cocoa has k

536
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,919
um Growers often get themselves in

537
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,158
trouble later in the cycle because

538
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:11,100
they'll add a PK boost

539
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,760
um a bloom booster which just creates K

540
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:17,099
talk so so potassium toxicity potassium

541
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,700
toxicity can lock out calcium and

542
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:25,678
magnesium it can create other issues so

543
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:28,080
growers in Cocoa often face issues when

544
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,120
trying to use those those PK boosters

545
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,639
just because there's already a lot of K

546
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,678
so be aware of that other sort of

547
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,400
dimension of it so let's say they have a

548
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,780
properly rinsed and buffered their cocoa

549
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,080
organic or synthetic nutrients let's get

550
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:45,359
into that so do you use or recommend

551
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,639
organic or synthetic nutrients when

552
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,279
growing in cocoa that is an interesting

553
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,380
question in an outdoor setting in field

554
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,918
Agriculture and in gardening I always

555
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,600
recommend and organic models and really

556
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,059
biodynamic models where we try to sort

557
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,000
of cultivate the ecology on the farm so

558
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:06,000
the soil level and farm level ecology so

559
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you

560
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:11,640
I mean to increase sustainability and

561
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,600
decrease the the throughput of chemical

562
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,520
fertilizers right of fossil fuels I mean

563
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,579
most of what we're growing our food with

564
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,700
these days are

565
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:27,379
nitrogen potassium phosphorus

566
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:31,679
fertilizers derived from natural gas

567
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:34,440
fossil fuel and the the process to

568
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,259
create them is incredibly energy in it

569
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,058
you know intensive so

570
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,000
um they're they're made with and they're

571
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:44,639
made from fossil fuels

572
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,220
um and you know Global agriculture on

573
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,679
the large scale is is supported by that

574
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,259
when we think about sort of how we use

575
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,720
fossil fuels going forward to so much of

576
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,298
our Global agriculture sort of dependent

577
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,500
on natural gas as a feedstock for

578
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:03,418
nitrogen fertilizer that like it where

579
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,079
you know you could argue we're eating

580
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:09,919
fossil fuel energy on a massive scale it

581
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,359
would sort of puts a lot of those

582
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,799
considerations into a different

583
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,798
perspective I think than people are

584
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:18,359
often used to looking at fossil fuels

585
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,700
um and that's something I'm really

586
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,099
interested in you know since my

587
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,880
undergraduate days is sustainability in

588
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,879
agriculture and

589
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,179
you know one of the rubs here and it's

590
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,939
something that

591
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:39,480
we've all decided to sort of go past

592
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,140
this but indoor farming under artificial

593
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,740
lights is not sustainable and it's very

594
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,320
energy intensive and

595
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,440
um it uses energy in sort of a wildly

596
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,079
different way than Farmers have ever

597
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,320
used energy before

598
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:01,558
um you know for the first 10 000 years

599
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,079
that our species was Farmers like we

600
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,879
used almost exclusively human and animal

601
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,759
energy

602
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,880
um and as we started sort of

603
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:15,599
supplementing fossil fuel energy over

604
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,520
the last just you know 150 years

605
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,619
um for the first half of that time it

606
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,460
was it was basically for transportation

607
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,259
of the food but now again so much of the

608
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,600
energy that we used in in regular

609
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,000
agriculture outdoor agriculture is in

610
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,399
the fertilizers that we're applying to

611
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,460
maintain crop yields

612
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,519
um and so

613
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:41,579
like that just use of energy and the

614
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,879
sustainability of that have completely

615
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,339
shifted into this dangerous sort of

616
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,919
territory and I think rightly a lot of

617
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,480
people have become concerned with global

618
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,400
agriculture

619
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,019
um and sort of the the source of our

620
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,980
food and and whether we'll be able to

621
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,000
maintain these kinds of yields under

622
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,798
biodynamic models that was something I

623
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,500
looked at a lot as a graduate student

624
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,778
you know how can we conserve how can we

625
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,599
maintain sort of the the Green

626
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:12,419
Revolution yields without using the

627
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,219
Green Revolution fertilizers and it's

628
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,100
possible and we need to sort of continue

629
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,380
to investigate that

630
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:21,918
foreign

631
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,880
we definitely understand that

632
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,080
crops

633
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,840
are you know more efficient in in their

634
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:35,099
specific return when we're able to dial

635
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:38,339
in nutrition so crop yields for example

636
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:43,139
in the global North crop yields on

637
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:45,058
um conventional acreage is a little over

638
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,778
and this is somewhat dated information

639
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:52,079
from like the

640
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:54,119
2010s around 2010

641
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,439
um crop yields were about two and a half

642
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,219
times

643
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,058
um as on organic cropland

644
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:05,000
primarily due to fertilization issues

645
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,678
um in the global South

646
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,659
biodynamic farming is actually able to

647
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,900
match the yields of conventional

648
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:15,360
agriculture but they invest a

649
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,340
tremendously tremendously more labor per

650
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,500
acre than they do in the global North

651
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,859
and so basically we're able to to

652
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,319
exchange our fossil fuel energy for

653
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,500
human labor can can take over a lot of

654
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,480
that but where the cost of Labor is high

655
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,339
those those balances don't work out and

656
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,919
I've spent literally years sort of

657
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,359
trying to understand and asking students

658
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,740
in questioning classes like do you guys

659
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,259
want to become peasants because like

660
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,298
that's one way we can create sort of

661
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,919
assist animal worlds we all go back to

662
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:46,019
being peasants

663
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,620
um but if we all insist on having these

664
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,900
you know consumer Lifestyles it's more

665
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,759
sort of problematic and where we demand

666
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,220
other people produce all of our food so

667
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,500
we don't have to produce any of it

668
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,400
indoor agriculture it's all about lights

669
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,278
and it's all about maintaining climate

670
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,640
and like we choose to do that because of

671
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,400
legal concerns and I think I think you

672
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,200
know that makes sense with some other

673
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,159
crops

674
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,159
you know they choose to grow indoors

675
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,020
other crops in places like Iceland

676
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,880
Iceland's got a thriving indoor

677
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,918
Horticulture industry for you know

678
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,140
vegetables because they don't have any

679
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,020
sun or not enough of it and they got

680
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,080
tons of geothermal energy so energy is

681
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:38,220
cheap they can power you know LED lights

682
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:40,500
indoors and and justify growing lower

683
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,038
value crops

684
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,579
um you know otherwise we're spending so

685
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:49,440
much energy on the lights and the

686
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:51,178
climate control growing indoors we have

687
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,380
to be growing a high value crop

688
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,880
otherwise it doesn't even make sense and

689
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,159
the amount of energy that we're spending

690
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,740
on lighting

691
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,260
absolutely dwarfs the amount of energy

692
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,558
that we're spending on fertilizers just

693
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,960
dwarfs it just like makes pennies out of

694
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,720
it it's like the amount of energy that

695
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,940
we're investing in fertilizers is now

696
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,640
like no longer even part of the equation

697
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,940
that makes sense to pay attention to and

698
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,440
if we want to farm sustainably indoors a

699
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,659
we have to recognize that we really

700
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,640
can't we're choosing to do something

701
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:30,720
that's unsustainable because there's no

702
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,440
other way to do it and we've decided

703
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,399
that you know a certain crop is valuable

704
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,100
enough to us that we're making that that

705
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,500
decision anyways basically and I think

706
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,658
all

707
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,880
you know Growers that are growing

708
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,260
indoors for legal reasons for other

709
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,240
kinds of reasons are making that that

710
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,720
decision like look growing this plant is

711
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,460
important enough to me that like I'm

712
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,440
doing that even though I got to run

713
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,720
these really powerful lights indoors and

714
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,159
even though you know it's not going to

715
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,659
be the most sustainable thing in the

716
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
long run when you're making those

717
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:09,020
decisions I think it becomes imperative

718
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:12,480
now that you think about how to limit

719
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:15,119
your overall sort of consumption how to

720
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,700
grow the best crop you can with the

721
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,979
least amount of energy and since we're

722
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,100
already sort of blowing our energy

723
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,798
Budget on lighting and climate control

724
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:27,719
then you know how do we tap into the

725
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,720
best of what we know about all other

726
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,259
forms of Agriculture so that we can have

727
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,839
these plants humming so that they don't

728
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,740
you know have to want for anything and

729
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,199
so that we can guarantee Harvest success

730
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:45,240
and the reality there is the most

731
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,399
sustainable I mean I really looked into

732
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,200
this before growing myself the most

733
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,658
sustainable way and the only real way

734
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,000
that I could justify indoor Horticulture

735
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,179
coming from a background of of a sort of

736
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,798
sustainable agriculture was to grow

737
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,500
conventionally and to grow

738
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,619
hydroponically so soillessly cocoa is a

739
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,319
form of Hydroponics I think that growing

740
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:10,558
in Cocoa is far more efficient with

741
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,079
water than dwc for example this is the

742
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,500
reason I don't grow in dwc you know dwc

743
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:18,960
Growers dump far more water down the

744
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,359
drain than cocoa Growers do even cocoa

745
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,278
Growers they have the the sort of awful

746
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,139
name for this which is drained to waste

747
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,398
and that is the way that I grow drain to

748
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,278
waste but the amount of water that I'm

749
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,739
sending on the waste is is dwarfed to

750
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,480
whenever a dwc grower has to change out

751
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,038
their tanks and they're sending all

752
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,620
their water down the drain or they're

753
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,859
sending all their water someplace

754
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:43,199
um I'm only sending a cup a day for my

755
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,178
little grow you know or a quart a day or

756
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,679
something like that really small amounts

757
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,140
that aren't actually repurpose all of my

758
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,538
runoff for house plants

759
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,538
um this tiny amount of it so drain to

760
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:58,619
house plant or whatever

761
00:31:54,538 --> 00:32:01,259
um but yeah so that's basically and and

762
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,119
you know there are ways to do this U.S

763
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,919
this original question with Organics or

764
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,839
conventional fertilizers or synthetic

765
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,820
fertilizers so I use synthetic

766
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,278
fertilizers there are some organic

767
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,200
fertilizers that that can be substituted

768
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,380
for them but I I haven't found them to

769
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,960
be you know an advent an advantage from

770
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,419
a sustainability angle in in terms of

771
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,880
thinking about how much energy are they

772
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:26,640
going to slow my crop down at all

773
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,880
um because if I have to run you know an

774
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,860
extra week in veg I've blown my margins

775
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,320
and whatever you're trying to save for

776
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:37,259
me or if this puts you know in any way

777
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:41,460
my crop at risk like I've blown my

778
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:44,038
margins I'm also aware now that a lot of

779
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,640
people sort of follow the way that I

780
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:50,158
grow you know pretty closely in terms of

781
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,740
my specific dosages of nutrients my

782
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,960
recipe my frequency of fertigation all

783
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,399
of these things and so it's important

784
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,899
that you know cumulatively

785
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,939
we're aware of the impact that we have

786
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:05,219
and and that we're sort of doing this

787
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,980
consciously in a way to to try to reduce

788
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,860
that I get a lot of pushback from

789
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,319
organic Growers that think that their

790
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:14,939
style of growing is responsible and my

791
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:19,019
style of growing is sort of

792
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,000
irresponsible and I I want to just

793
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,220
suggest to All Growers that it really

794
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,159
requires thinking deeper through these

795
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,579
problems and recognizing especially in

796
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,220
an indoor Horticulture like where does

797
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:34,619
our impact really come from what and how

798
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,778
can we responsibly sort of work to to

799
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,558
minimize that

800
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:40,259
um

801
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,480
so it was from that perspective that you

802
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,740
know my background's not in in grad

803
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,419
school my background was working with

804
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,480
field agriculture Farmers that were

805
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,360
using synthetic and kind of organic

806
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,919
styles of fertilization but like they

807
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,319
weren't growing in Cocoa core they

808
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,259
weren't growing hydroponically

809
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,619
um all of that that really came when I

810
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:06,240
decided to to grow my own

811
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:08,398
um indoors that yeah I I wanted to be to

812
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,338
figure out and to sort of use the

813
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,138
experience that I did have and kind of I

814
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,179
was still a grad student sort of my

815
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,579
penchant for doing that kind of research

816
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,338
to figure out the best way to minimize

817
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:23,039
this impact to to do the most efficient

818
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,079
Garden this is also incidentally why I'm

819
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,398
so sort of interested in lights and what

820
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,199
I really test about lights is how

821
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,000
efficient they are and sort of how well

822
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,939
they distribute the light and all of

823
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,039
that because we're doing this for making

824
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,500
that decision to grow indoors let's do

825
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,019
it as well as we possibly can understood

826
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,659
yeah I think a lot of my audience are

827
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,539
indoor home Growers kind of similar to

828
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,280
me and I feel like a lot of folks are

829
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:48,960
using synthetic nutrients so let's

830
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,899
narrow down the conversation a little

831
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,579
bit to indoors and let's let's talk a

832
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,739
little bit about using synthetic

833
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,920
nutrients with cocoa before we get into

834
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,059
like EC and pH and stuff like that

835
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,220
aeration options I know there are some

836
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,320
people who are adding in like I used to

837
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,358
add in perlite some people had Thomas

838
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,059
vermiculite lava rock there's a lot of

839
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,920
different aeration options what aeration

840
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:14,639
options do you recommend and at what

841
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,960
ratio aeration to Cocoa

842
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,179
if

843
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,280
they even container size

844
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:25,440
um container size depends primarily on

845
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,220
watering frequency

846
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,980
um

847
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:31,019
so if you're going to be the type of

848
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,059
grower that only wants to to water their

849
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:34,320
plants once or twice a day and I I

850
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:37,139
realize that might sound like pretty

851
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,440
frequently but I advocate high frequency

852
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:44,759
fertigation in in Cocoa so

853
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,380
um higher than that so once or twice a

854
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,640
day

855
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,680
um you're going to want a larger

856
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,480
container

857
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,739
um if you're going to go five six times

858
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,679
a day you're going to be able to get

859
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:57,299
away with a smaller container and I

860
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,419
encourage you to kind of think of the

861
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,640
container that you're growing in as like

862
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,880
the cup that you give like your your

863
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,618
guests at a party okay and so if you

864
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,599
give them a small cup you better be

865
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,119
running around and refilling their cups

866
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,338
all of the time right if you give them a

867
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,500
larger cup like you know you don't have

868
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,078
to fill up their cups all the time so

869
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,539
watering in a sense is filling up the

870
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,140
cup right

871
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:27,599
um and yeah if you're going to water six

872
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,639
times a day then you can grow big plants

873
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,519
in a one gallon container and I I

874
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,858
totally endorse that style

875
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,079
um if you're gonna only water once a day

876
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:39,719
then you can grow that same plant in a

877
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,760
three or five gallon container and that

878
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:43,739
would be a better option now your

879
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,940
question is actually about perlite right

880
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:50,639
so perlite ratio depends on the size of

881
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,300
the container and to some extent your

882
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:56,098
watering frequency as well

883
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,960
larger containers I like to put more

884
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:04,140
perlite in more of that aeration in

885
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,199
General it certainly aerates per like

886
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:09,239
certainly aerates it's really what we're

887
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,000
hoping to get out of that perlite is

888
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,858
improved drainage

889
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,619
um

890
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:17,719
cocoa holds on to water a little bit too

891
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:22,500
well

892
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:24,779
basically so we like to encourage the

893
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,119
water to to drain out a little bit

894
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,140
easier and that's one of the good things

895
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,940
that the perlite does coco unless you

896
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:35,759
have all dust remember talking about

897
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:38,460
like chips and you have fibers in

898
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,480
addition to your dust then cocoa stays

899
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,539
pretty well oxygenated even if it's pure

900
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,780
cocoa and even if it's at Field capacity

901
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:52,139
which means like fully saturated

902
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,760
um there's still oxygen available to the

903
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,639
plant

904
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,700
um so

905
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:03,779
but what happens if you're in a large

906
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:03,779
enough container and

907
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,219
you know it's the dissolved oxygen in

908
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,740
the water accounts for a large

909
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,519
proportion of the available oxygen to

910
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:15,899
plants and if you're watering

911
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,019
infrequently especially if you're

912
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,358
watering less than once per day

913
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:24,420
especially if the the water sitting in

914
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:27,299
the pots is above 70 degrees which it

915
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,400
almost always is in our Gardens after a

916
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,800
few hours there's not going to be a lot

917
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:36,180
of dissolved oxygen in that water it's

918
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:40,400
going to be hypoxic and if you have an

919
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,399
area that doesn't have a lot of roots

920
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,200
um

921
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,139
so the roots are actually where most of

922
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,759
the water gets taken off right we often

923
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:49,980
think about the water sort of like just

924
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,140
pouring through the pots but we're we're

925
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,079
filling a cup and then the the plant is

926
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:57,059
like drinking that cup right this is one

927
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,260
of the reasons we transplant up to make

928
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,699
sure there's Roots all the way in the

929
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,440
center because it's really in the right

930
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:03,118
in the middle of like you have a big pot

931
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,679
right in the middle of that pot The

932
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,240
Roots tend to grow around it they grow

933
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,399
out to the edges they grow it onto the

934
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,078
bottom and they'll leave this area in

935
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,059
the middle of the pot that doesn't have

936
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,640
a lot of roots sucking out the water and

937
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:16,559
the water is allowed to get sort of like

938
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,539
stagnant there if it doesn't have enough

939
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,179
perlite to sort of vertically flow

940
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:23,460
through it'll become hypoxic and that's

941
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,279
basically a dead zone for roots because

942
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,920
there's no Oxygen for them so if you're

943
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,720
growing in like a big container get a

944
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,338
lot of aeration in the middle of that

945
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,139
make sure that you know the water is

946
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,858
going to continue to move through there

947
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:40,500
because Roots like that area less and it

948
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,279
tends to become sort of stagnant and and

949
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,139
not

950
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,240
as as well sort of oxygenated

951
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:50,338
um conversely if you're growing a big

952
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,578
plant in a one gallon pot you don't need

953
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:55,259
perlite in fact hey adding too much

954
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,839
perlite just sort of cuts down on the

955
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,480
amount of water that you can store in

956
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:04,139
that pot because you know a one gallon

957
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,059
pot that's full up with 100 cocoa can

958
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:07,379
hold a little over half a gallon of

959
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,480
water

960
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,539
um a one gallon pot that's stock full of

961
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,000
like 50 50 cocoa per light can hold less

962
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:16,800
than half a gallon of water

963
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,780
um so you're you're sort of cutting back

964
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,339
sort of the reservoir function of the

965
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:25,079
pot for the plants and that's going to

966
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:25,078
require you to increase fertigation more

967
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:32,119
um so yeah it depends I go anywhere from

968
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:35,759
no per light to only like 10 to 20

969
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,338
sometimes up to 50 per light in a larger

970
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,260
container with less frequent watering so

971
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:42,299
perlite is your go-to you don't

972
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,760
recommend like vermiculite or lava rock

973
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,599
any of those other options

974
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,240
um

975
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,599
and per lead's definitely my go-to or

976
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,699
one of the the specific perlite

977
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,920
substitutes I I don't think vermiculite

978
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:58,098
is a good substitute for perlite in

979
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,019
Cocoa for this purpose at least

980
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:03,000
vermiculite tends to hold on to water

981
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:06,000
more

982
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,579
um it does do some of the same aeration

983
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,420
but it's not as good at sort of eating

984
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:17,099
and drainage as perlite is

985
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,740
um Lava Rock can work for this

986
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,599
um there are other things that you can

987
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:22,858
substitute per life for and I'm aware

988
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,440
that some Growers don't like to use

989
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:27,179
perlite specifically I will say there's

990
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,260
a couple of drawbacks to using perlite

991
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:30,719
that should be mentioned I think

992
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,000
whenever it's brought up do not allow

993
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,559
yourself to breathe perlite dust ever

994
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,179
ever it's rock dust it it

995
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,920
causes it it's like so much worse than

996
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,480
smoking I mean it's moments worse than

997
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,220
like anything else you can do get a

998
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,858
respirator a ventilator do it in an

999
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:49,559
outdoor space at least we're like a n95

1000
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:52,858
mask or something just I see so many

1001
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:54,239
people either on sort of videos or in

1002
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:56,338
real life or walking through commercial

1003
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,098
facilities where people are dealing with

1004
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:01,019
perlite just breathing In This Cloud of

1005
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,599
perlite dust

1006
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,838
um disaster don't don't put yourself in

1007
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,519
that situation it's rock Dusty it kill

1008
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,578
you so that's one of the issues

1009
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:14,579
perlite's also you know a mind resource

1010
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:17,700
and there's a limited sort of Global

1011
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:21,720
Supply of perlite

1012
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:23,460
um but we're not sort of at a threshold

1013
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,500
I actually think the

1014
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,099
peat is a bigger issue to be worried

1015
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,019
about and concerned in those regards in

1016
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:32,760
terms of you know how how sustainable

1017
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:34,380
the mining of the resource is good

1018
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,700
advice on the mass I don't wear a mask

1019
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,320
and I probably should I don't really

1020
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,299
hear people talking about the safety

1021
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,920
behind handling perlite so I'll

1022
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,500
definitely be wearing a mask moving

1023
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,539
forward yeah get the vents on or

1024
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,579
whatever you can do to I mean whenever

1025
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,500
you pour and get it wet right away is to

1026
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,060
knock down that cloud of dust right but

1027
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
if you get a bag of perlite and you pour

1028
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:54,838
it you're gonna have this like cloud of

1029
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,280
rock dust that you get to breathe in oh

1030
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,940
yeah let's switch it up let's get into

1031
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,099
pH of uh you know specifically when

1032
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,639
growing with synthetic nutrients in

1033
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:09,539
Cocoa what is the optimal PH range

1034
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:11,639
it's hydroponic So the plan is for the

1035
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:15,179
most part interacting directly with the

1036
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:18,299
water it's not sort of mitigated by any

1037
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:21,960
other cation exchange or microbial

1038
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:24,839
activity or anything like that so we

1039
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,800
keep generally for for hydroponic

1040
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:31,500
nutrients the pH between 5.5 and and 6.5

1041
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,579
is what's often quoted I would never

1042
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:38,818
kind of push out those extremes

1043
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:42,480
um calcium is more available at the

1044
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:44,818
higher end of that range so early on I

1045
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,059
usually recommend growers in Cocoa start

1046
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:51,900
at like 6.2 ish

1047
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:54,599
um but then by early veg have worked

1048
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,420
down you know in the high fives and

1049
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,059
allowed the pH to sort of drift up pH

1050
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,900
almost always drifts up if you're mixing

1051
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:06,059
nutrient water so to set it like 5.8 and

1052
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,280
allow it to drift up to six and

1053
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:10,679
6.2

1054
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,359
um you know in that range allowing it to

1055
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,179
drift back and forth a little bit

1056
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,279
ensures that plants have good access to

1057
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:20,899
the different chelated nutrients that

1058
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,660
are sort of more accessible at different

1059
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:28,260
points along that pH scale

1060
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:31,318
um you don't want to drill it in at 5.6

1061
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,560
for too long basically because calcium

1062
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:38,039
is not very available that low you also

1063
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,619
don't want to sort of drill it in at 6.4

1064
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,920
for too long phosphorus isn't very

1065
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,960
available there so keeping it kind of in

1066
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,260
the middle of that range the other thing

1067
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,000
I suggest with most forms of a

1068
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,180
Hydroponics certainly with any form of

1069
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,420
drain to waste Hydroponics

1070
00:44:53,179 --> 00:45:00,719
is to only measure the inflow pH don't

1071
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:04,318
measure the outflow or the runoff pH now

1072
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,639
in our dwc recirculating systems you

1073
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,619
know you got to measure both it's all

1074
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,539
kind of the same thing

1075
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:13,619
um and in dwc you got to just measure

1076
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:15,300
the whatever they're sitting in but in a

1077
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,358
drained away setting where you're doing

1078
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,460
top feed in Cocoa the important thing

1079
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:22,679
about pH is that the water that you're

1080
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:26,400
providing has nutrients that are

1081
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,858
accessible you are not you really can't

1082
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,639
stress this enough you are not trying to

1083
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:35,400
like change the runoff pH by altering

1084
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,739
the inflow pH that's a Fool's errand

1085
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,019
I've seen dozens and dozens of Growers

1086
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,659
torch their plants by doing that their

1087
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,460
runoff pH starts to drift High often is

1088
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:46,858
what happens and so they'll just go

1089
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,179
lower and lower and lower with the

1090
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:50,338
inflow and they're telling me I'm

1091
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,199
feeding at five and I'm still getting

1092
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:54,779
these plant issues and my runoff is

1093
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:58,618
still 6.8 or something it's like okay

1094
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,900
stop feeding at five like you can't you

1095
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:03,539
can't do that that's a problem you

1096
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,720
should never go so you can chase Your

1097
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:08,159
Tail like that so easily and just run

1098
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,919
yourself right out of sort of what the

1099
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,318
acceptable range is so much so I tell

1100
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,920
Growers literally don't measure the

1101
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:19,318
runoff pH expect it to swing because

1102
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,579
because of cation exchange with the

1103
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,079
plant

1104
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,700
um you know things are going to happen

1105
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,720
to that water it's going to knock around

1106
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:29,818
that pH oftentimes it's not a problem

1107
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:33,419
we'll never look at the pH the runoff pH

1108
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:35,940
except as a secondary sort of diagnosis

1109
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,539
diagnosis tool if you're having problems

1110
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:42,179
with with maintaining EC for example if

1111
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:44,579
you're runoff EC is always high so you

1112
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:46,919
do check the runoff EC but not the pH

1113
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,420
but if it's always high and we can't

1114
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,220
knock it down eventually I'm going to

1115
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,500
tell okay let's figure out what the EC

1116
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,299
or what the pH is and we'll try to get

1117
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,380
deeper into a diagnosis about what's

1118
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,240
going on like that but no as part of

1119
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,980
your general practice make sure the

1120
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,199
water you're providing to the the plant

1121
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,760
is in the correct range and just don't

1122
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,799
even worry about what the runoff's

1123
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,440
coming I'm glad you mentioned that I've

1124
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,240
always had good luck going 5.8 pH going

1125
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,500
in and when I first started using cocoa

1126
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,939
I was checking the runoff I was coming

1127
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,619
across that same exact issue that you

1128
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,858
mentioned it's like why is it 6.8 feet

1129
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:22,200
why is it 7 pH runoff right and so I was

1130
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,239
scrambling and it's so tempting to go

1131
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,779
like five and then lower on the inflow

1132
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,159
right I read to ignore the runoff pH and

1133
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,740
so ever since I've been doing that my

1134
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,358
plants have been fantastic so um yeah

1135
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:36,118
I'm really glad you mentioned that one

1136
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,858
yeah now as far as water that they that

1137
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,838
you're giving it to them and that's the

1138
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:42,659
cool thing about about this style of

1139
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,059
growing anyways is like no matter how

1140
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:47,519
screwed up Situation's gotten in their

1141
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,980
pot like I can still give them good

1142
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,079
water that I know is is correct now

1143
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,059
that's the most important thing give

1144
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,619
them good water that you know is correct

1145
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:58,980
now

1146
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:01,858
um now EC sometimes we do sort of if the

1147
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,900
EC is getting too high in the runoff you

1148
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:05,759
go lower on the inflow to sort of

1149
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,559
correct for that

1150
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,700
um

1151
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,199
and I don't know if that's where you're

1152
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,159
going next but that's probably where we

1153
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,858
should that's why I was going to ask

1154
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,078
about next is EC or some people actually

1155
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:17,279
you know measure PPM instead you know

1156
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,200
same thing just different calculation

1157
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,579
but different stages of growth the

1158
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,500
plants different nutrient requirements

1159
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:24,599
some people start with a low EC and then

1160
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,480
work their way up talk to us about EC

1161
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:30,180
and Coco yeah so first let's talk a

1162
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,619
little bit about EC versus PPM EC is a

1163
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:38,699
measure of the electrical conductivity

1164
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:42,240
and if you have an EC or a PPM or a TDS

1165
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:45,659
or what's just called a quality or water

1166
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,598
quality meter what it's measuring is

1167
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:50,159
easy it's got a little probe two little

1168
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,260
electrical Pros it's passing an

1169
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:55,318
electrical current through the water and

1170
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,500
it's measuring sort of how easy that

1171
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,179
current flows through the water

1172
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,039
um

1173
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:05,519
what

1174
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:08,940
why that's important is well a few

1175
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:11,460
things but it that tells you how many

1176
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,619
sort of dissolved solids are in the

1177
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,960
water if there's no dissolved solids in

1178
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,579
the water then you know it's very hard

1179
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,858
to pass an electrical current through

1180
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,079
water but if you have a chock full of

1181
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:25,500
calcium then it's pretty easy to pass

1182
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:29,099
the current through the water so the EC

1183
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,480
reading tells you sort of how salty

1184
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,920
because all those things that are

1185
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,139
dissolved in the water we can just

1186
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,900
consider them and think about them as

1187
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:40,799
being salt okay so it's basically

1188
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:43,800
telling you how salty the water is

1189
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,500
now PPM

1190
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:50,339
is parts per million

1191
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:55,139
and parts per million tries to tell you

1192
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:58,199
how many sort of parts per million in

1193
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:00,838
this water are are different things so

1194
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:05,960
for example how many parts of calcium

1195
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:10,679
and phosphorus and iron and potassium

1196
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:14,220
and sodium like are in this

1197
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:17,098
now would a PPM meter does is it

1198
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:21,959
measures the electrical conductivity and

1199
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:25,380
then using a formula it says okay if the

1200
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,380
electrical conductivity is this then I

1201
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,318
assume so much of this water so much of

1202
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,539
that is coming from calcium because in

1203
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:35,639
most water in most places around the

1204
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,639
world the bulk of the electrical

1205
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:41,879
conductivity comes from calcium calcium

1206
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:45,659
is a double charge count on so it has

1207
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:49,619
sort of a bigger impact on electrical

1208
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:53,519
conductivity than on PPM each

1209
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:56,039
unit of calcium there's only one PPM but

1210
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:59,639
has a double charge so if you have one

1211
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,858
unit of calcium and one unit of sodium

1212
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,960
you know you're gonna have your PPM

1213
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,578
would be maybe two out of a million

1214
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,920
right

1215
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:09,539
um but your electrical conductivity is

1216
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,200
going to be higher because of that

1217
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:16,619
calcium being one of the two so in order

1218
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,659
to make an estimate about sort of how

1219
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,099
many how much stuff is in the water all

1220
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,379
we know is how easy it is to pass

1221
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,420
electricity through it how much stuff is

1222
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,720
in the water you know there's different

1223
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,900
formulas for for figuring that up this

1224
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:34,078
is why we have different PPM scales in

1225
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,139
Europe there's less calcium in the water

1226
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:40,019
than there is in the Americas in general

1227
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:42,539
so when you're making an estimate about

1228
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:44,579
from electrical conductivity two parts

1229
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:46,500
per million you're going to assume that

1230
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,579
sort of there must be more other stuff

1231
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,980
because I think there's a little bit

1232
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:53,940
smaller ratio of calcium and and that

1233
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:56,699
gives them sort of the scale the 700 PPM

1234
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,980
scale in the United States where calcium

1235
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:00,659
is is tends to be in larger proportion

1236
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,980
throughout the air Americas calcium

1237
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,558
tends to be in large proportion we use

1238
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:08,400
500 scale and that's just a different

1239
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,839
formula for going from you know what the

1240
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,400
meter is measuring is the electrical

1241
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,259
conductivity to like different

1242
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,200
assumptions about what must be in that

1243
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,839
water to arrive at a gas and it's really

1244
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,419
just a guess about what that PPM is so

1245
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:23,639
if you have a PPM meter your meter is

1246
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,559
measuring electrical conductivity and

1247
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,500
then using a formula to guess what the

1248
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,119
actual PPM is

1249
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,400
there's another way we can approach

1250
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:37,079
coming at PPM right where we could like

1251
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,720
get a a scale and you know dry nutrients

1252
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,420
and we can actually

1253
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:44,939
weigh out and and know exactly sort of

1254
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,579
how many parts calcium and how many

1255
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,980
parts phosphorus and how many parts you

1256
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:52,380
know everything that that we put in the

1257
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,940
water and we could describe that and you

1258
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,079
know you can reverse engineer this if

1259
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,720
you get good information from your

1260
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:02,339
nutrient companies in terms of what your

1261
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:05,098
PPM actually is and from that angle we

1262
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:07,019
think about PPM in terms of dosing like

1263
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,359
how many parts per million do we want of

1264
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:11,880
calcium how many parts per million do we

1265
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,619
want of phosphorus how many parts per

1266
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,358
million do we want and I think when

1267
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,880
we're thinking in terms of parts per

1268
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,058
million like people tend to think about

1269
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,700
it in terms of all these different

1270
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:25,619
nutrients and like you know that's one

1271
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,719
thing that I often get from people it's

1272
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,579
like well why does the PPM matter

1273
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,699
doesn't it matter like what the PPM of

1274
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:34,920
nitrogen and and phosphorus and and you

1275
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:37,259
know potassium is why do I just need one

1276
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,260
number that describes all of that and

1277
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:44,220
and that's a damn good point we don't

1278
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:47,520
need one PPM number and that's that's

1279
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:51,598
not why we're measuring EC

1280
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:53,039
now all you have is a PPM meter you can

1281
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,059
basically sort of crib off of that

1282
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,900
because what your meter is actually

1283
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:59,819
measuring is EC anyways right but what

1284
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,500
we're doing this for and why we measure

1285
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:02,818
it has nothing to do with making sure

1286
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,559
there's enough nitrogen and enough

1287
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:06,539
phosphorus and enough potassium and

1288
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,420
enough calcium and and making sure those

1289
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:11,759
dosages are right we never use

1290
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:15,000
electrical conductivity to measure dose

1291
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,859
of specific nutrients we measure

1292
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,519
electrical conductivity to understand

1293
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:23,219
the overall salinity of the water

1294
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,699
because the overall salinity of the

1295
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:29,939
water it affects the plant's ability to

1296
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:31,980
get water not the applicability to get

1297
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,780
nitrogen and phosphorus and calcium like

1298
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,460
we basically assume oh that's there

1299
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,640
because I followed a recipe and I'm

1300
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,039
using like reputable nutrients right so

1301
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,739
the ratios better be there based on the

1302
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,858
products that you're using but if you

1303
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:49,318
provide too much of them and you're

1304
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:53,400
giving your plant the this water that's

1305
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:56,519
then really salty the plant will not be

1306
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,980
able to get the water so we need to be

1307
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,219
able to keep the the sort of overall

1308
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:05,159
electrical conductivity in a Range where

1309
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:07,679
the plant a sort of is trained for it

1310
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:12,779
and B expects it

1311
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:15,358
um and for the most part I think Growers

1312
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,400
try to sort of push their plants a

1313
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,858
little bit too much in electrical

1314
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,780
conductivity thinking about it in terms

1315
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,338
of I want to provide more nutrients I

1316
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,380
want to provide more nutrients I want to

1317
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:26,940
like push the gas pedal but what you

1318
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,079
don't realize is as you're pushing the

1319
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:35,338
gas pedal you're making osmosis harder

1320
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,440
um so in order to get water

1321
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:40,799
right if there's like a cell membrane

1322
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,659
there's water inside the root and then

1323
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,579
there's water like in the cocoa in this

1324
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,159
case on the outside of the root right if

1325
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:48,480
the water outside the root is really

1326
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,699
salty

1327
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,800
and the plant gets water through osmosis

1328
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:55,259
so the plant needs to increase the the

1329
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,180
concentration of the solution of the

1330
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,640
water inside the root basically it does

1331
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:01,558
this by manufacturing sugars so that

1332
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:03,659
there's a higher concentration of sugars

1333
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,339
in the water inside the root than the

1334
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:07,920
concentration of salts in the water

1335
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:10,440
outside the root and and that allows

1336
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,659
water to flow into the root because

1337
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,240
water flows from osmosis across that

1338
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:17,399
sort of gradient from the area of of

1339
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:21,058
lower concentration to the higher

1340
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:24,838
concentration of dissolved solids

1341
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:26,880
um so your plant can be trained for a

1342
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:29,159
higher a higher electrical conductivity

1343
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,019
basically you can like gradually work

1344
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:32,699
plants up and up and up and they'll keep

1345
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,559
manufacturing more sugars and more

1346
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:37,379
sugars in their roots to be able to sort

1347
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,079
of continue to absorb this water despite

1348
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,180
the increasing salinity and some Growers

1349
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,579
can get away with sort of Tran training

1350
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:47,279
their plants to take a pretty high

1351
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:48,960
electrical conductivity

1352
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,599
um I don't necessarily think that's

1353
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:55,199
beneficial but like plants can be

1354
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,800
trained that way but if you jump

1355
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:02,219
electrical conductivity too fast they've

1356
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,740
been used to say like 1.0 and you

1357
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,939
suddenly go to like 2.0 like you've

1358
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:07,679
doubled it

1359
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,639
there's not going to be enough sugar in

1360
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,039
The Roots

1361
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,299
and there's gonna be so much salt in the

1362
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,519
water outside the ridge that water

1363
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,039
literally gets sucked out of the root if

1364
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:18,900
you ever poured salt on a slug that is

1365
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,880
what happens in this situation so water

1366
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:24,539
actually can get pulled out of the root

1367
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,300
through osmosis so the reason we test

1368
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:30,719
electrical conductivity is all about

1369
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,660
osmosis and it's really all about

1370
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:37,379
keeping that electrical conductivity in

1371
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:40,379
the range that the plant is expecting if

1372
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:42,300
it goes down too much the plant starts

1373
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,818
taking in more water than it wants to

1374
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,480
take in it quickly has to convert those

1375
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:51,239
sugars to starches and and sort of to

1376
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,579
stop that process that that requires

1377
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:56,639
energy that the plant is not growing

1378
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:59,039
with and if the electrical conductivity

1379
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,460
quickly goes up then the plant has to

1380
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,759
manufacture new sugars using energy that

1381
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,380
now it's not using to grow with so if

1382
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,720
you're swaying the electrical

1383
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,519
conductivity up and down and back and

1384
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,098
forth I know a lot of Growers do an

1385
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:16,500
alternating flush where basically it's

1386
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,260
one watering at like a really high EC

1387
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,239
the next watering plain water the next

1388
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,940
watering really high EC the next

1389
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:27,118
watering plain water your poor Plant is

1390
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,338
just like oh I it's salty I gotta

1391
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,200
increase sugars oh it's not salty I

1392
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:34,078
gotta process those sugars into stalts

1393
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,639
or into starches oh it's salty again I

1394
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,818
got a menu and you're just making your

1395
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:43,318
plant work every single day to adjust to

1396
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:46,739
the salinity level of the water so sort

1397
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:49,440
of the the number one thing that I think

1398
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:51,000
if you're using you know an EC if you're

1399
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,220
and some people fertilize with much

1400
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,798
lower ECS and that's sort of okay to go

1401
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:57,779
back and forth in in terms of that but

1402
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:01,858
it's

1403
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:04,260
in a style like Coco certainly you'll

1404
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:07,858
pick up a lot if you just go to feed

1405
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:09,960
every time at the right dose key plants

1406
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:11,759
love consistency plants really love

1407
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,000
consistency that's like my number one

1408
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,160
sort of theoretical idea about plants

1409
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,019
um keep just keep them at that level

1410
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:20,399
that they're good with the electrical

1411
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:22,619
conductivity don't be swinging them

1412
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,798
around and they'll be able to sort of

1413
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:27,480
invest much more energy into growth than

1414
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,159
than they would if you're swinging them

1415
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,000
around like that

1416
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,940
um

1417
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,338
so when we're growing in Cocoa

1418
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,500
we want to know the electrical

1419
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:40,920
conductivity of the water that goes in I

1420
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,599
have a fairly low Target uh 1.5 is

1421
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:47,338
pretty much the the highest I'll ever

1422
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,660
put my inflow uh um so 1500 or 1.5 on an

1423
00:59:47,338 --> 00:59:49,980
EC scale

1424
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:51,899
and

1425
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,039
you know we want to monitor the the

1426
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,200
runoff

1427
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:58,259
so that the runoff is not getting too

1428
00:59:55,199 --> 01:00:01,919
much higher than the inflow

1429
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,480
um so if I'm going in at 1.5 or 1500 and

1430
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,159
again this is like late flower like

1431
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,500
that's the highest that I ever get my

1432
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:09,719
info EC up to

1433
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,460
um 1.2 is sort of where I'd be in veg

1434
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,199
for most of the time or an earlier

1435
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,619
flower

1436
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:20,000
um so if I'm going in it's a 1.2 then I

1437
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:22,318
want my runoff to be within 1.5

1438
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,358
1.6 is going to start raising my

1439
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,338
eyebrows it goes above 1.6 and I'm going

1440
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:29,159
to start to take action to bring the

1441
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:32,279
runoff EC back down

1442
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:35,879
um so I want to keep it within 300

1443
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:41,040
within 400 it's usually okay but in that

1444
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:43,380
range so above what the inflow is

1445
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,679
um usually we can expect the the

1446
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:50,160
electrical conductivity will go up in

1447
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:51,659
between watering events so when you

1448
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,279
think about the water that you're adding

1449
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:55,199
to the top of the plant that's new water

1450
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,940
the water that comes out the bottom is

1451
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,558
not that water the water that comes out

1452
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,119
the bottom is all old water it's already

1453
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,339
been sitting and it kind of gets pushed

1454
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:05,039
out the plant as what new water gets

1455
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:08,279
added to the top the old water has been

1456
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:10,500
sitting there for a while and we would

1457
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:14,099
expect that the EC is going to be higher

1458
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:18,079
because generally the plant removes

1459
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:21,599
water faster than it removes nutrients

1460
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,880
and so nutrients sort of accumulate in

1461
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:28,280
the pot and the electrical conductivity

1462
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,720
goes up in between fertigation events

1463
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,660
and if we notice that it's going up too

1464
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:36,838
much so the runoff is now like two right

1465
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:40,500
I I fed at 1.5 or 1500 and it's coming

1466
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:43,259
out at 2 or 2 000 then the problem we

1467
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,940
need to feed more frequently that's the

1468
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,819
first thing that I would think I'm

1469
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:50,039
giving too much time in between these

1470
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:52,380
events and that's allowing the EC to

1471
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,900
creep up too high increasing the

1472
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,940
frequency or the decreasing the interval

1473
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,760
between feeding events is likely to

1474
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,700
resolve the issue and that's the best

1475
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,299
way to resolve that issue

1476
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:08,159
um if you can't for whatever reason

1477
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:10,440
um you know you can try increasing

1478
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:14,219
quantity but that results in additional

1479
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:16,920
runoff or lowering the the inflow

1480
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:20,399
electrical conductivity to sort of allow

1481
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:22,980
for a light or larger rise now Growers

1482
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,900
that are in that are only able to

1483
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,659
fertigate like once or twice a day

1484
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,338
generally have to sort of allow for a

1485
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:31,558
larger rise than Growers that can

1486
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:33,119
fertigate you know five or six times a

1487
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,980
day so lots of good information there

1488
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,460
one area I actually want to get into

1489
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,599
which is somewhat controversial

1490
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,818
inoculating with microbe specifically

1491
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,318
when growing cocoa and using synthetic

1492
01:02:41,818 --> 01:02:45,298
nutrients now there are some people that

1493
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:47,159
say it's beneficial they've seen a

1494
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:48,780
benefit inoculating with microbes

1495
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:50,940
utilizing microbes during that grow

1496
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,519
there are other people that say this is

1497
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,740
completely false you should not be

1498
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,960
inoculating with microbes because the

1499
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:59,399
medium is inert the nutrient parents are

1500
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,380
already in a form that's available for

1501
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,619
the plant uptake so the microbes don't

1502
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,640
have any value what's your take on that

1503
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:09,298
you know I certainly think they have

1504
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:11,400
less value than they do in other styles

1505
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:13,679
of fertilization

1506
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,599
um but regardless of style of

1507
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,699
fertilization there are some microbial

1508
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,338
activity that works in this energy and

1509
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:23,939
in the rhizosphere so in in the roots

1510
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:27,358
that Aid in nutrient uptake

1511
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:30,358
um even in a cocoa grow even in a dwc

1512
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:32,338
grow even in a dwc grow that that's

1513
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:33,420
running sterile

1514
01:03:32,338 --> 01:03:36,298
um you know with like a high

1515
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,338
concentration of hydrogen peroxide there

1516
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:43,139
are still symbiotic relationships with

1517
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:46,199
bacteria in the roots so there are like

1518
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:49,920
every style of growing

1519
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:53,460
sort of requires some bacteria in some

1520
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:56,639
Styles we need to maintain that better

1521
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,260
and you know I think organic Growers

1522
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,239
that are depending on sort of breaking

1523
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,780
down organic fertilizers

1524
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:06,919
um into sort of plant accessible Farms

1525
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,180
can really get a huge Boost from sort of

1526
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,079
inoculating with some bacteria or

1527
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,419
inoculating with different

1528
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,039
microorganisms that at the right time of

1529
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:18,000
their grow

1530
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:21,119
um and you know treating that one of the

1531
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,239
challenge is with any kind of is

1532
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,039
synthetic drain to waste system in

1533
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,500
particular is

1534
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:30,960
you know the whole idea of drain to

1535
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,000
waste is we're getting rid of some

1536
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,960
things we're sort of flushing a little

1537
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:41,519
bit out each watering event

1538
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,818
um and it makes it somewhat harder to to

1539
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:47,219
maintain uh you know microbial

1540
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:51,000
communities we're also not necessarily

1541
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:53,399
feeding them anything so you know in

1542
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,559
organic nutrients Growers sometimes use

1543
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,599
stuff like for example a fairly famous

1544
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,339
one is molasses

1545
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,280
um which is really used primarily to

1546
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:04,619
feed you know microbes that then feed

1547
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,140
the plant it's not necessarily used to

1548
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:10,440
feed the plant directly

1549
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:12,298
um and you know if you're not using

1550
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:16,200
those things it becomes a little bit

1551
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:17,460
sort of less beneficial

1552
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:21,419
um but there are still times and places

1553
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,460
for that I don't do a great deal of

1554
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,980
inoculation

1555
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,798
um but I'm aware of that I kind of lean

1556
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:31,440
towards the side where we are able to

1557
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:35,039
take control of of a lot of the

1558
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,139
fertilization and sort of you know a lot

1559
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,298
of what the plant's able to absorb and

1560
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:43,500
uptake

1561
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:45,900
um I guess the downside would be wasting

1562
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,579
money and resources using a product that

1563
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,619
you're not sort of getting a benefit

1564
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:52,380
from

1565
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:56,160
um but I I don't think that there's a

1566
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:58,559
downside in terms of you know doing that

1567
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,779
is going to screw up your plant or is

1568
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,640
necessarily going to cause problems

1569
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,619
either

1570
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,838
um so I like to I always like to

1571
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:07,920
separate practices grower practice

1572
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,719
because there's all sorts of different

1573
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,659
grower practices out there into things

1574
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,939
that are you know

1575
01:06:11,659 --> 01:06:16,618
beneficial harmful and then probably not

1576
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:18,659
either

1577
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:22,500
um you know beneficial or harmful

1578
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:26,358
practices and I I would put a lot of the

1579
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,298
ways synthetic Growers use

1580
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:33,960
microbes as

1581
01:06:29,298 --> 01:06:35,119
probably not beneficial or harmful

1582
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,818
um

1583
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,700
at least in the root zones like that

1584
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:45,298
it it's it's tough

1585
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:47,399
um I mean I suppose on the other side of

1586
01:06:45,298 --> 01:06:49,500
this is that is one of the reasons why

1587
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,019
we're growing this style

1588
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,780
um why we're investing in in those

1589
01:06:52,019 --> 01:06:57,538
nitrogen fertilizers for example at this

1590
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,579
scale I think that it makes sense but

1591
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:01,319
we're like I said at the top of the

1592
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:04,500
podcast we get those nitrogen

1593
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:07,079
fertilizers from natural gas and in a

1594
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,719
really energy intensive process in order

1595
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:13,019
to sort of separate the nitrogen from

1596
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:13,578
the the not hydrocarbons

1597
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:16,798
um

1598
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:18,119
and I I you know at the scale that we're

1599
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,659
growing and considering these other

1600
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:23,280
things I I tend to think that that makes

1601
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:26,578
it worth it and that does sort of

1602
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,680
alleviate the need to practice dpology

1603
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:30,298
within our Gardens

1604
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:33,598
um I still like taking that ecological

1605
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:35,159
approach where it makes sense to and

1606
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,099
where it makes sense too at that point

1607
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:40,078
is more in sort of the IPM side on the

1608
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:42,838
pesticide side on the you know

1609
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,000
beneficial insects and and that

1610
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:47,578
ecological approach in terms of working

1611
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,059
with Biology to solve our problems as

1612
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:53,460
opposed to sort of trying to be God

1613
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:55,680
um but I'll admit there's a certain

1614
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,480
aspect of my style of growing where I'm

1615
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,279
trying to sort of be God in this

1616
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,818
situation I figure I have to create the

1617
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,740
Sun for these plants so I'm gonna try to

1618
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,259
sort of hand feed them everything else

1619
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:09,000
as well that makes sense so we are

1620
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,579
coming up towards the end of the episode

1621
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,099
here and I want to ask you is there

1622
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:15,780
anything else in regards to growing Coco

1623
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,920
using synthetics that you wanted to

1624
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:20,000
cover in this episode that we didn't

1625
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,000
cover you know I think

1626
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:28,920
we come

1627
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:31,080
um I I don't think that that's sort of

1628
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,779
the only reason to grow in Coco but I I

1629
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:35,159
think that it's important it's a point

1630
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:36,660
that I like to make to people because

1631
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:38,818
it's something that's important to me

1632
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:40,679
and if you if you guys are interested

1633
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:42,839
out there in the audience in terms of

1634
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:45,179
sort of being sustainable with your home

1635
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:46,759
grow to think more about some of these

1636
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:49,079
other dimensions I think sometimes

1637
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:53,640
choosing quote unquote organic options

1638
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:55,920
is sort of like you know in maybe more

1639
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,838
about the the karma relief as opposed to

1640
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,640
the actual environmental relief that

1641
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:02,219
you're getting out of that in certain

1642
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,440
situations so to think through this and

1643
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:06,000
and I think that that's important I

1644
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:07,798
think talking about calcium magnesium

1645
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,539
and cocoa is always important in sort of

1646
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:12,420
getting that message about buffering and

1647
01:09:09,539 --> 01:09:13,979
continuing to provide a calmac dose in

1648
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,920
the water

1649
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:18,778
um high frequency fertigation you know

1650
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,960
the fact that cocoa even at Field

1651
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:25,140
capacity holds on to adequate oxygen for

1652
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,719
the roots so I'm definitely on the side

1653
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,920
that there is no such thing as over

1654
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:32,338
watering

1655
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,679
really in any kind of Agriculture what

1656
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:36,778
happens isn't that the plants have too

1657
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:39,659
much water what happens is that the

1658
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:41,160
plants don't have enough oxygen so all

1659
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:42,899
of the things that we're used to

1660
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:44,698
thinking about in terms of quote unquote

1661
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:46,500
over watering and if you're coming from

1662
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:48,719
peat or if you're coming from heaven

1663
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,979
forbid soil which isn't peat most

1664
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,779
Growers that think they're growing in

1665
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:54,178
quote unquote soil are actually growing

1666
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:58,860
in peace soil and in this sense would be

1667
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:59,539
like dirt like you know sand silt clay

1668
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:02,639
um

1669
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:04,619
you're used to having to really limit

1670
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,539
the amount of water that you provide or

1671
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:09,719
having to create a dry bag period and

1672
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:12,600
all of this is really about maintaining

1673
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,399
adequate oxygen for the roots it's not

1674
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,440
about starving the plants of water but

1675
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,119
the only way to get them adequate oxygen

1676
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:20,759
in The Roots is starving them from water

1677
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:24,179
but if if over watering was just about

1678
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,739
over watering like dwc would not be a

1679
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:27,300
thing it wouldn't be a way to grow

1680
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:29,459
plants right because they always have

1681
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:32,600
too much water it's not about too much

1682
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:36,899
water it's about oxygenated water

1683
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:41,280
and yeah so cocoa can be watered almost

1684
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:44,039
constantly because it maintains adequate

1685
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:46,319
oxygen and when you're watering it you

1686
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,600
know frequently a lot of the oxygen

1687
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,479
itself comes from the dissolved oxygen

1688
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,760
in the water it's important to keep your

1689
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:56,099
water if you're depending on that below

1690
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,840
70 degrees Fahrenheit so I usually like

1691
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,260
to keep my water right at like 68

1692
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:04,020
degrees Fahrenheit because above 70

1693
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:06,539
there's not the ability of water to hold

1694
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,400
dissolved oxygen basically drops off a

1695
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:10,679
cliff at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit

1696
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,479
like at 68 water can hold a lot of

1697
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,658
dissolved oxygen at 72 it can hold

1698
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,399
almost none so it really helps to sort

1699
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:19,198
of think about that in terms of water

1700
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:22,079
temperature that's also if you're ever

1701
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,839
running a res with these systems to keep

1702
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:27,658
the res cooler because if it gets above

1703
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,880
70 degrees Fahrenheit the oxygen levels

1704
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,099
drop and that's when you start to grow

1705
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,600
bacteria in your tanks and you're going

1706
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,159
to have to do cleaning more frequently

1707
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,560
and all the rest of that so if you have

1708
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:38,939
a watering system or a tank that you

1709
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,500
have to clean all the time get it a

1710
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:42,419
little bit colder drop it below 70

1711
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,219
degrees and you'll sort of resolve those

1712
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,600
issues

1713
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,239
um

1714
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,440
I I think that's most of it I could

1715
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,959
probably ramble on for a few more

1716
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,359
minutes but I think we did Cover a lot

1717
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,819
of the the key points and you know I got

1718
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:58,920
a lot of other

1719
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:00,960
resources and and articles

1720
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,658
um videos on this stuff so if you're

1721
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,219
interested in in more of that I invite

1722
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:07,619
you to come and check out our stuff

1723
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:09,600
definitely some good information there

1724
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:12,238
uh yeah we touch upon a lot you know

1725
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,560
growing in Cocoa using synthetics I mean

1726
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:15,238
I think that we could even do another

1727
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,179
episode in the future at some point

1728
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:19,859
cocoa and Organics or even cocoa and

1729
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:22,399
synganic right because a lot of people

1730
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:24,479
are mixing the two and growing the cocoa

1731
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:27,359
yeah maybe we could do something like

1732
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:29,939
that in the future you know this organic

1733
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,859
mood is like I'm gonna take what makes

1734
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:34,319
sense from different things and apply

1735
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:36,899
them to my grow and I like that style of

1736
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,698
growing where you know you think through

1737
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,019
things and you figure out what makes

1738
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:41,579
sense as opposed to just going with

1739
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,260
something because of the label that it

1740
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,539
has or thinking that it's safe or not

1741
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:48,380
safe because of the label that it has so

1742
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:50,698
I I endorse and sort of

1743
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:52,380
identify with that style if you guys

1744
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:54,419
tuning into this want to see that talk

1745
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,340
definitely comment below and let us know

1746
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,440
you want to see a part two on Coco and

1747
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,020
we can definitely get into that but yeah

1748
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:02,759
let's wrap things up final words how can

1749
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,080
listeners find you and did you have

1750
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,539
anything upcoming in the future that you

1751
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:10,380
want to talk about yeah so I have a a

1752
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:12,539
YouTube channel Dr MJ Coco on YouTube

1753
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,520
um I have some videos like we mentioned

1754
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:16,738
about Coco

1755
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,140
um and growing and Coco like my

1756
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:20,879
germination tutorial I do a lot of of

1757
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,079
grow light reviews and I know next time

1758
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,219
that we come on uh we'll talk about

1759
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,679
Horticultural lighting and sort of what

1760
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:30,239
we're interested in in Horticultural

1761
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:31,859
lighting how to compare evaluate

1762
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,299
different lights and so you'll find a

1763
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:34,920
lot of that kind of content on my

1764
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,539
YouTube channel

1765
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,520
um I also run the website Coco for

1766
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:40,500
cannabis.com

1767
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:44,400
um so you'll be able to find uh my

1768
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:46,738
articles we have a big Community

1769
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:49,859
um we do grow challenges which are

1770
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:51,178
basically collaborative grow alongs

1771
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:53,099
um right now we're in the middle of the

1772
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:54,600
New Year grow challenge which started on

1773
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:58,260
January 1st

1774
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:00,360
um and a few hundred Growers growing

1775
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,360
together in that

1776
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:06,179
um we also find all my my grow light

1777
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,979
reviews and everything else there so and

1778
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:09,600
those are the two big ones I'm also on

1779
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,178
Instagram

1780
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,640
um and and do some things there but I do

1781
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:16,260
some other podcasts and stuff but um

1782
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,579
yeah check out my YouTube channel and

1783

come visit us awesome well I'll

1784
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:20,399
definitely have a link to YouTube

1785
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,840
channel down in the YouTube video

1786
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,000
description section below so you can

1787
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,920
easily get to his channel and stay tuned

1788
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,719
for next week next week he's gonna be on

1789
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,840
again Dr MJ Coco and we're going to talk

1790
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:32,880
about Led LEDs are the present and the

1791
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,640
future of of Horticultural lighting

1792
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,140
there's really sort of no question about

1793
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,579
that

1794
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:40,320
um regardless sometimes hit me up with

1795
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:42,000
questions about like well something else

1796
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:44,519
is going to come next or some new

1797
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,520
technology it's like ain't maybe but

1798
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:51,320
LEDs are already about 90 efficient in

1799
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:54,000
terms of energy transfer so it's it's

1800
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:55,738
hard to see sort of how another

1801
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,439
technology could come on I'm gonna be

1802
01:14:55,738 --> 01:15:00,718
much more efficient than the they're

1803
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:03,539
pretty phenomenal in in terms of sort of

1804
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:05,460
how LEDs themselves work I think

1805
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:07,920
understanding a bit more about them can

1806
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,020
really help Growers become better sort

1807
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,539
of consumers of grow light fixtures on

1808
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,580
the market too because I think a lot of

1809
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:17,279
Manufacturers are taking advantage of

1810
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:19,979
the fact that Growers don't know a lot

1811
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,500
about indoor lighting for Horticulture

1812
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:23,218
and so

1813
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,800
manufacturers are able to sort of

1814
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:28,020
manipulate Growers and and try to

1815
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,500
convince them of a bunch of BS and

1816
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,300
that's been happening for years and my

1817
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,819
big passion there is to try to arm

1818
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,619
Growers with sort of the the knowledge

1819
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:39,899
that they need so they're not sold a

1820
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:41,460
bill of goods right so that they

1821
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,799
actually can go out there and evaluate

1822
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:46,140
grow lights and and make good product

1823
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,960
decisions so yeah I definitely look

1824
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:51,539
forward to getting into that and talking

1825
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,600
about how to evaluate and why even what

1826
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:57,119
we're looking for why LEDs are what I

1827
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,400
say the future of Horticultural lighting

1828
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,319
all of that so I'm excited about that

1829
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:03,658
topic I'm excited for that one as well

1830
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:05,579
so look forward to that next week as
