1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
coming up on garden talk water

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
temperature and environment temperature

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,119
is critical for this plant especially

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,160
during this rooting stage you need that

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,480
higher warmer temperature to encourage

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,879
the root growth i like to keep a rooting

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
hormone in my sops every time there's

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,839
definitely three stages of rooting the

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,000
first is callus the next is striking and

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,359
the third is searching

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you know in theory if your plants are

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,679
green to begin with and they turn purple

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
in your rooting stage yeah you gotta

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,518
adjust what you're feeding and what

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,039
you're saturating your trays with and

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,199
more than likely you gotta you gotta

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,519
match what that plant previously was

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
getting start reading the backs of

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,719
labels of products and bottles what the

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,960
actual active ingredient is feed what

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
the mother plant you cut from was being

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
fed

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
you don't want to change it up

24
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,359
what's up everybody if you that don't

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

they have a super strong frame thick

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,680
canvas density and a height adjusting

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920
roof

and a two foot extension kit is optional

54
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,399
so you can grow even taller plants

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,000
they also have the light line same

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,118
quality as the original gorilla grow

all right we are back welcome to the

76
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,799
garden talk podcast today i am joined

77
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,598
with paul the clone coach how you doing

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
today i'm doing well man how are you i'm

79
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,560
doing great thanks for asking um so paul

80
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,639
is an expert when it comes to cloning so

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,439
i figured i based this episode around

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,119
that

83
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,199
there's so many different ways to clone

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
and it can be a bit challenging at times

85
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,119
to get clones to successfully root

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
depending on the method that's used so i

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
really want this episode to reveal some

88
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,439
good best practices that will help the

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,640
listeners be successful cloning

90
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,318
before we get into cloning that deep

91
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,679
let's do an introduction can you tell us

92
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,199
a little bit about yourself and kind of

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
how you got into gardening

94
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,878
yeah absolutely um

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,878
i've i've been gardening since kind of

96
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,280
like my late teens you know as a hobby

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,158
just plants always interested interested

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,598
in me

99
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,560
um you know i started back in the day

100
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,719
just by

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,878
kind of getting seeds from chili's and

102
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,799
stuff that we were eating and you know

103
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,878
propagating them germinating them and

104
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,120
then um putting them in uh little pots

105
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,199
and stuff and growing that same plant

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,878
and eating peppers that we had for

107
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,878
dinner so kind of showing the rest of

108
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,639
the family hey you know all these seeds

109
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,000
that are inside could become other

110
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,479
plants

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
so just had hobby gardens you know

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,158
growing up and stuff but always had a

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
love and a passion for

114
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,318
for plants in general and um yeah you

115
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,158
know earlier in my career i was

116
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,079
traveling a lot so i couldn't have a

117
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,318
garden because i was always gone so i

118
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
was kind of always uh you know kind of

119
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,479
in the back of my head but finally when

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,640
i um you know stopped traveling for work

121
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,719
i was able to you know garden a lot more

122
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,399
so it's it's always a good passion it's

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
good therapy and i encourage others to

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,198
do it awesome good stuff there

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,319
um so let's get into

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,360
just some basic questions to begin

127
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,159
i do have another cloning episode on

128
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,919
this podcast if anybody's interested

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
we get real deep into the process kind

130
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,399
of step by step on how to take clones i

131
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,240
believe if you search my name mr growit

132
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,959
and then clones or how to take clones it

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,439
should pop up it's with trey strums from

134
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,478
cltv in this episode right here we won't

135
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,439
go over the

136
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,199
the beginner type details uh but it will

137
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,360
certainly involve a lot of the details

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
needed in order to be successful in

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
various ways

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,199
the first question i have for you is

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,079
why is it important to take clones from

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
a healthy mother plant it's everything

143
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,800
really um you know the the importance of

144
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
it is uh that the fact that

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,960
the mother plant and your clones they go

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
hand in hand so anything that your

147
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,319
mother plant is experiencing good or bad

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
you're going to show it in your clones

149
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,959
so you know clones you always want to

150
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
have the best start possible because

151
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,560
your your crop is essentially writing on

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
that so

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,600
taking clones from the healthiest mother

154
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
plants being

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
you know

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,560
no stress no environmental stress you

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,038
know fully acclimated to their

158
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
environment fully fed nutrient wise you

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,319
know no deficiencies

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
that's going to give you the best

161
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,038
possible product on the next stage so

162
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,840
you know cloning from a healthy mother

163
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,000
plant is is vital and it's it's the

164
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,799
first step to producing the best

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,360
possible stock you can so if you do take

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,879
if you do happen to have a plant that is

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
showing assigned deficiencies maybe

168
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,680
you're starting to see

169
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,959
nitrogen deficiency to begin

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,199
and you can't wait around you got to

171
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,038
take those cuts that day

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,120
can the person still be successful is

173
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,839
that clone still going to root so on and

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,079
so forth and if that clone could recover

175
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,839
and then turn out to be a usable plant

176
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,519
or do you just totally recommend that

177
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,079
the plant has to be 100 healthy in order

178
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,560
to take clones off you know if if life

179
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,918
is working against you you have to cut

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,839
off of that plant when it's not in the

181
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,359
best stage possible you got to do what

182
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,799
you got to do right

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,600
rooting is one half or one portion of

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,840
creating uh you know a proper clone

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
so the plant can still root if it's a

186
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,159
bit deficient

187
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,000
now

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,439
the top half of that plant the stem and

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,879
the new growth and the leaves are going

190
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,879
to show its deficiency a lot more so you

191
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,560
can get the plant to root but you're

192
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,560
going to take a lot more time an extra

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,439
week two weeks to bring that plant

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
health

195
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,598
back up to a stage to where it's

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,719
acceptable to move on to the next stage

197
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,800
so

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
usually if that's the case you'll have

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
roots on the bottom but as you move up

200
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,318
the stem you go from green to purple to

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,479
purple darker purple and then your inner

202
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
nodes are going to be really tightly

203
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,959
spaced and there's really not a lot of

204
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,840
developed growth when it comes to your

205
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,839
new leaves or anything like that so it

206
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,198
can root you know this plant's amazing

207
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,758
it will root

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,080
but you will suffer as far as your your

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,598
canopy and your leaves and uh your

210
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,359
structure goes so

211
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,800
you know take that in mind

212
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,639
okay that makes sense and we'll

213
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
definitely get into purple and red stems

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,918
later on in the episode that's that's a

215
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
question i have slated for that because

216
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,198
i know that's a common question but

217
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,120
first

218
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
tips on the cutting process i know this

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,360
is a very broad question right

220
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,839
but kind of to narrow it down a little

221
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
bit is there a certain time to take

222
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,359
cuttings like does the plant need to be

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,959
a certain height for example

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
and then what part of the plant i heard

225
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,959
that uh you know there's differences

226
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
between taking cuttings from the bottom

227
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,959
part of the plant versus the top part of

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,199
the plant can you talk to us about that

229
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,959
yeah i mean some good rules of thumb i

230
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
mean you want to take

231
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,758
cuttings off of a plant that's been

232
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,159
growing for i say about 14 days

233
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,280
undisturbed undisturbed meaning no

234
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,280
topping no pinching no bending

235
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,918
just want that growth to to be

236
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,559
undisturbed for a good 12 to 14 days

237
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,560
before you cut that growth

238
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,959
which is you know nine times out of ten

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,399
gonna be off the top of the plant right

240
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,959
beneath your lights if you're in an

241
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,959
indoor setting um you know cloning from

242
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,639
the bottom of the plant in an indoor

243
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,799
setting that's not getting direct light

244
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,038
so your your your stems are going to be

245
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,319
a lot thinner um you know your plants

246
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,639
are not going to be as developed and

247
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,039
it's not as not as hardy once again it

248
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,559
can and will root but your clone is

249
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,480
gonna be just a little bit weaker a

250
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,719
little bit you know behind everything

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,360
else that is not used to the intensity

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,839
of the light and the food and kind of

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
the the rapid activity happening inside

254
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
the plant so

255
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,399
it's best recommended to have your plant

256
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,639
grow for about 14 days

257
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,519
take off uh the growth that's been grown

258
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,480
right underneath the lights there and um

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,839
have

260
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,920
as many as much um

261
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,839
cross-contamination practices in mind so

262
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,559
you want to have clean scissors

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
um or clean scalpel clean razor blade

264
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,639
clean anything

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,200
when i say clean you want to use

266
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,838
products um that actually

267
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
get rid of viroids and viruses and

268
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,959
anything like that viroid being

269
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,278
like the main thing nowadays and then

270
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,879
you know alcohol doesn't kill the viroid

271
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,000
um you know according to all of these

272
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,120
studies and everything that that are

273
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
being done

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
so you know an easy product that

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
everybody has access to is bleach

276
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
10 bleach

277
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,640
um you know a 30 second to 1 minute

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
dwell time is about what they recommend

279
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,159
so not a quick dip and a rinse there

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,639
actually has to be a dwell time on the

281
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,559
surface of your tools um in between

282
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,120
plants and stuff so

283
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,719
cut off the new healthy growth and keep

284
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,560
clean uh tools to to make those cuts off

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
your plants so you're saying isopropyl

286
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,639
alcohol which is very very common that

287
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,959
people use to sterilize their equipment

288
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,199
you're saying that's not sufficient it's

289
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,359
not sufficient as far as a viroid goes

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,879
being hoplite and viroid which is a

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
really big concern

292
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,000
and a lot of commercial grows nowadays

293
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,600
so i mean it's good for other practices

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,278
but you know generally speaking too if

295
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,079
we take a step back

296
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,838
you need to wash a surface before you

297
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,919
sanitize the surface

298
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,240
so if the surface has debris or already

299
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,639
has plant material on it or has any

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
buildup on it and you just dip it into

301
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,838
alcohol or anything else

302
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,039
you're not getting to the surface of

303
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
that tool

304
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,000
so alcohol takes you so far but a clean

305
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,759
surface and the right product will

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
guarantee you better success as far as

307
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,120
your tools go

308
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,879
that makes sense

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
so after you take that cutting right but

310
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,759
i guess size of the cutting is one thing

311
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,639
i kind of want to get a little deeper

312
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,039
into

313
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,439
generally speaking i've heard about six

314
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,399
inches at the minimum certainly it'll

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
root with you know smaller than that it

316
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,879
can larger than that what's your take on

317
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,759
the size of cutting to take

318
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,838
so

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,759
if you're using traditional domes uh

320
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,560
humidity domes that's a seven inch dome

321
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,399
on average so you don't want your plant

322
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,958
to be touching the top of that dome for

323
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,679
14 days you know accumulating humidity

324
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,919
and condensation on you know that fresh

325
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,278
growth up top so you want to be about an

326
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,120
inch below that

327
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,200
so that you know and you're going to

328
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,278
plug in your stem into your cloning

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
media about an inch or so

330
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,559
so that

331
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,719
six inches you know an inch goes into

332
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,719
the media and you have um you know a

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,959
couple inches of play with up top so six

334
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
could be a little bit short

335
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,919
once you plug it in and put it into a

336
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,838
tray so just above that um

337
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,159
six inch mark is kind of where you want

338
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,920
to be and it's going to be dependent on

339
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,159
the development of the plant

340
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,639
and kind of the the new nodes and the

341
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,278
fan leaves coming off of it so i like to

342
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,360
base it on the the top nodes

343
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,439
and the newest growth down to the bottom

344
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,480
of the stem on a nice cutting mat you

345
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,399
know line my my new growth there my stem

346
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
at the bottom there's usually a 45

347
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,600
degree angle on your cutting mat get a

348
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
nice clean cut

349
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
and you know it's not gonna be perfect

350
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,359
and that's okay um because you have a

351
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,278
little bit of play within the dome and

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,839
when you're treating the entire tray as

353
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,159
one as one canopy a little bit of play

354
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,839
quarter inch here half inch there is

355
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,480
just fine in the grand scheme of things

356
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,120
so just over six inches it should be

357
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,879
perfect for a seven inch dome

358
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
so you sterilize your scissors you've

359
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,240
taken that cutting

360
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,239
some people dip it into a rooting

361
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
hormone although that's an optional step

362
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,720
right would is there a particular type

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
of rooting hormone uh that you recommend

364
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
uh maybe talk about like liquid versus

365
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
powder stuff like that i've tried uh

366
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,879
there's a few out there there's a

367
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
handful out there right and you know

368
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,720
there's new um hormones coming onto the

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
market as well

370
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,800
but they all have that same active

371
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,759
ingredient which is kind of what you

372
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,078
want to

373
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,240
start reading the backs of labels of

374
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,719
products and bottles what the actual

375
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,000
active ingredient is in your products

376
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,839
and what strength and or percentage um

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,759
is in that product so for rooting

378
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,959
hormones endo

379
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,439
endobiuric acid iba and i think there's

380
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,958
a few different strains of iba

381
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,360
which i think like a liquid will have

382
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,119
one strain or two strains combined you

383
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,959
know powder will have you know the other

384
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,360
one and gels um have an indole

385
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,518
endobiuric acid as well

386
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,480
my personal favorite is clonix it's been

387
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
around forever um you know it works i

388
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,039
know there's new products out there and

389
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
i want to give them a shot i want to

390
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,639
give side by side

391
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,879
and you know see how they do

392
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,600
some say reading hormones are are

393
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,879
optional but it's just a staple in my

394
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,360
sops so it's just you want to help

395
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,559
trigger um you know rooting and striking

396
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
the roots and that's what that hormone

397
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,239
does

398
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
so

399
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
you know why not give you know the plant

400
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,600
everything that needs for that short

401
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
period of time you're expecting it to do

402
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
you know a lot of a lot of growing you

403
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
know creating a callus striking roots

404
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,519
creating a root zone you know and all

405
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
this stuff during the rooting process so

406
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,320
i like to keep a rooting hormone in my

407
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
sops um every time

408
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
so after you dip it into that rooting

409
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,559
hormone

410
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,399
it could go into a variety of different

411
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,119
things right so um you could actually

412
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,198
put it into a cube you could put like a

413
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,198
root riot cube is what i'm referring to

414
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,679
um you could put it into rock wool you

415
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,359
could put it directly into soil or cocoa

416
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,799
which is what i often do i just do kind

417
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,959
of like the lazy man method i don't want

418
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,639
to go and buy the rock wool or cubes

419
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,559
directly into the soil do it takes a

420
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,959
little bit longer to root uh from my

421
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,399
experience but it still will root under

422
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,838
the right conditions

423
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,639
or they skip all that and they just do

424
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,000
aeroponics aeroponic cloner um another

425
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,519
broad question for you can you talk to

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,879
us about the differences between those

427
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,639
things and how

428
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,600
the success rate can vary and so on and

429
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,639
so forth

430
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,759
yeah absolutely um i mean as a general

431
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
statement the the environment needs to

432
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,159
hold

433
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,638
a certain amount of moisture

434
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,679
and a certain amount of oxygen so that

435
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,839
ratio is what the the stem and root zone

436
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,679
really needs to to begin its reading

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
process and to go throughout its reading

438
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,319
process

439
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,679
so as long as a good ratio of moisture

440
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
to oxygen

441
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,039
that's why you know you could do it in

442
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
cocoa soil and all these different

443
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,919
medias and the plant will strike roots

444
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,919
and will grow and will do its thing so

445
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,439
that's kind of the the rule of thumb and

446
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,879
what is needed on a basic level um now

447
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
as far as different methods go like

448
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,639
aeroponics i used to do that back in the

449
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,278
day um

450
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,198
but it's a bit finicky it's it's like

451
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,278
any other aeroponic system or and or

452
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,559
hydroponic system or deep water culture

453
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,159
system where if there's any variation in

454
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,518
your parameters

455
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,639
you're more than likely going to have

456
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,600
issues so if a timer goes down or if the

457
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,440
water chiller is not chilling water or

458
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,240
any issues like that happen you have

459
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,079
very little room for margin for error so

460
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,399
you really need to have

461
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,000
you know close eye on your system to

462
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,600
ensure there's no hiccups throughout

463
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,839
your your routing process so it works

464
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,440
that moisture oxygen level gets created

465
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
in that environment in the aeroponic

466
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
system

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,799
but if your temperature's off or

468
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,278
anything like that you could have some

469
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,958
issues and there's not an easy way to

470
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,360
recover from that

471
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,679
um the different types of media

472
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,639
rockwool is a traditional one it's been

473
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,479
used for who knows how long and it works

474
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,360
it works just fine

475
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,519
and especially if you're going to go

476
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,879
into another rockwool cube that's where

477
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,799
you want to start off with it's a great

478
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,159
it's a great starting point

479
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,559
it's got a good moisture to oxygen ratio

480
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,519
um you know most people squeeze the

481
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,479
cubes

482
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
to

483
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,560
for whatever reason they have in mind

484
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,078
but i don't i you know i say they come

485
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,599
from the manufacturer with a certain

486
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,439
ratio that they could hold so much

487
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,360
moisture and not hold anything more than

488
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
that so i don't squeeze any of the

489
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,240
rockwool cubes like most people do

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,679
any cubes really

491
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,679
oasis cubes is like a floral foam so

492
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,720
it's another um

493
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,559
good slab to use but it's very delicate

494
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,798
when it's dry like pulling it out of the

495
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,359
box it just falls apart when it's dry

496
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,359
it's it's so delicate but once it gains

497
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,599
moisture and you moist and you

498
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,438
saturate it it's good to go and it holds

499
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,038
its place and stuff and it's a it's a

500
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
good media

501
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,599
now

502
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,119
there's also the root rights like you

503
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,078
mentioned and i think that's a great

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,239
option

505
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,759
for like hobby growers and or people

506
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,038
that aren't doing too much production

507
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,119
too often

508
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,038
and i say that because you know you

509
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,519
still have to manually

510
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,519
um you know saturate the cubes and then

511
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,000
fill in your 50 cell trays or however

512
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,759
many um you know cells you're doing in a

513
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,720
tray you have to manually plug all of

514
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,079
those individual cubes on a small scale

515
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,798
it's not a big deal but when you're

516
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,199
doing commercial scale that's a lot of

517
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,119
labor that is wasted

518
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,960
so on a commercial scale my personal

519
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,199
favorite are the ihort trays the xl

520
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,000
trays to you know narrow down they got a

521
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,640
few products but those come pre-filled

522
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,839
so that 50 cell tray comes pre-filled

523
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,640
with a coco coco based media with a

524
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,879
little bit of perlite and

525
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,759
some some

526
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,280
just way to keep it keep it compact so

527
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,240
when it you could break it down like

528
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,319
soil

529
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
but it holds its its shape when it's in

530
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,319
the cube and it's in the tray and stuff

531
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,720
so that's my personal favorite because

532
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,480
it comes pre-filled and you save a ton

533
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
of labor when it comes to the commercial

534
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,759
scale

535
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,639
so you could you could clone and root in

536
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,960
most

537
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,360
most medias

538
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
just just gotta work with that ratio of

539
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,399
moisture and dry backs and oxygen and

540
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,319
stuff to encourage the root growth yeah

541
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
i know temperature is another thing that

542
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,200
kind of you got to keep an eye on

543
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,279
particularly in soil or cocoa is

544
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,840
primarily like i mentioned what i clone

545
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,038
in or stick my clones into i've had

546
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,798
issues where

547
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,480
i didn't really monitor the temperature

548
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,319
it was too low you know what i mean and

549
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,640
it was on the ground and

550
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,720
it just it wasn't high enough

551
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
temperature in that medium in order to

552
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,038
promote the growth

553
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
so that the plants started to die off

554
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,519
you could see the leaves started to

555
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,519
become yellow

556
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,960
and then and then i went and put a heat

557
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,359
mat on it common thing that people use

558
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,840
heat mat underneath it

559
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,719
and then it recovered you know all it

560
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,480
needed was just heat that's it yeah so

561
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
uh heat mat is another thing worth

562
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
mentioning that uh if you're having

563
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
trouble getting that uh the temperature

564
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,798
to where it needs to be

565
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,639
heat bat is definitely uh something to

566
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
look at yeah and i wouldn't recommend

567
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,759
you know throwing the tray on the floor

568
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,798
it's because it's the coldest spot in

569
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,240
the room especially if it's like a

570
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,000
concrete floor or something like that

571
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,839
it's the coldest spot is and it's the

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,599
closest to your root zone or where

573
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,959
you're trying to create a root zone

574
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,119
hence you know the issues you just

575
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
described will will definitely happen

576
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,879
you know um so you know keeping it

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
elevated off the ground

578
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
you know getting a good you know

579
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,839
temperature is critical

580
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,359
um you know water temperature and

581
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,038
environment temperature is critical for

582
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,798
this plant especially during this

583
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,480
rooting stage you need that higher

584
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,599
warmer temperature

585
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,519
to encourage the root growth and um

586
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,759
you know get that root zone and get get

587
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,798
activated so

588
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,759
so the rooting process it's three stages

589
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,079
i was doing some digging on your youtube

590
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,839
channel and uh sorry video you talking

591
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,918
about the three stages of rooting can

592
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,359
you talk to us about that

593
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,159
yeah there's definitely three stages of

594
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,359
rooting the first is callus the next is

595
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,600
uh striking and the third is searching

596
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,839
so and the catalyst stage happens in the

597
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,279
first few days of the rooting process

598
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,759
and essentially your stem is going to

599
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,599
form a callus it's going to you're going

600
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,679
to see thick

601
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,918
almost scaly bumpy

602
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,159
growth come off of your stem and that's

603
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,400
the first stage and that's where that um

604
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,000
rooting hormone helps aid in this

605
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,519
process as well

606
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,038
but it's going to create that first

607
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,079
callous state so your stem is going to

608
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,480
form

609
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,639
you know callous all around that and

610
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,798
you'll notice sometimes too like if you

611
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,038
cut off of uh a fan leaf or something

612
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,639
like that and you you leave a wound that

613
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,240
it'll start to form a callus there too

614
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,360
if the environment's right because the

615
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,640
plants just want to form and do that um

616
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,798
stage

617
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
from the callus you're going to strike

618
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,119
roots and these are just tiny little

619
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,880
nubs that are just like little spikes

620
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,798
like a little just little spikes coming

621
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,280
off this callus that are just beginning

622
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,158
that root striking stage and that

623
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,038
happens uh between like days four and

624
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,000
seven

625
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,679
um kind of the middle stage of rooting

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,480
and um

627
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,240
after the striking stage is a searching

628
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
stage and is essentially where you're

629
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
creating your root zone so you're

630
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,279
encouraged you're encouraging the root

631
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,000
growth and searching to to show

632
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,879
the roots a bit more in the root ball

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,279
by uh by doing these dry backs and by

634
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,720
reducing moisture levels so that the

635
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:00,558
roots are forced to search for water and

636
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,839
in doing so they're displaying

637
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,000
themselves they're creating a bigger

638
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,798
root zone and they're out there actively

639
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,240
searching for water um you know coming

640
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,400
in contact with the root inoculant

641
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,279
that's in your slabs coming in contact

642
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,960
with the nutrients and

643
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,678
that's what will get you through your

644
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
your process a lot better so

645
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,320
there's three stages of rooting and if

646
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,599
you're having any issues with rooting

647
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,599
and you tear apart one of your cubes you

648
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,199
could see what stage it made it to or

649
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,439
did it make it past

650
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,600
and so with that you could help diagnose

651
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,720
where you're you're having issues so if

652
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,719
it's not even creating a callous and you

653
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,319
know you realize hey yeah the

654
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
temperature was too low and i put this

655
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,279
heating mat and all of a sudden it's

656
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,120
formed a callus now striking roots

657
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,000
you're able to diagnose where your

658
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,239
issues are um if you form the callus and

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,960
struck roots but they're just you just

660
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,400
don't see any roots on your cube and you

661
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,679
know i had to break it apart now there

662
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,280
are some roots where you know why aren't

663
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,798
they showing on the outside

664
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,639
well on the later half you got to

665
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,038
encourage uh the roots to search for

666
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,120
water so increase your dry backs reduce

667
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,720
your humidity levels so that's where you

668
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,759
could kind of use those three stages of

669
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,679
rooting to help dial in um you know your

670
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,400
whole process

671
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,240
so moisture content super important um

672
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
the initial soaking i want to dig a

673
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
little bit deeper into that

674
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,759
you know the root right plug some people

675
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,038
will soak them prior or the rock will

676
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,079
soak it prior and then you mentioned

677
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,640
kind of squeezing it out and how do

678
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,359
people dial in that moisture content and

679
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
also i want to wrap ph into this because

680
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,199
some people will make sure that water is

681
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,079
a certain ph that they're soaking that

682
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
cube into can you talk to us about those

683
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,678
yeah with ph you want to start a little

684
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
bit lower than general so if you're

685
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,080
feeding your your plants normally about

686
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
6.0 ph and some cocoa or something

687
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,199
you're going to start a few points below

688
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,880
that so about five eight or so

689
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,798
if you're in rockwool it's kind of the

690
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,320
only one that you need to go even lower

691
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,400
than that about five six even five five

692
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,000
especially for that initial soak

693
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,759
and it's even recommended on it on the

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,599
packaging so rockwool because it starts

695
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,038
a little bit lower everything else just

696
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,599
want to be about 5758 just to

697
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,319
encourage that that that acid in the

698
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,759
rooting hormone and everything to

699
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,678
to help the whole process you know

700
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,038
strike roots as far as saturation goes

701
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
i don't like

702
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,599
squeezing

703
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,360
the the cubes for a few reasons

704
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,119
if you squeeze a cube and i squeeze a

705
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,399
cube it's going to be different the

706
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,798
third person squeezes the cube it's

707
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,038
going to be different again so you need

708
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,720
consistency when it comes to producing

709
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,319
clones on a mass on a mass scale

710
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,600
especially commercially you need

711
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,839
consistency it's it's paramount so

712
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,319
having someone do something manually

713
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,158
eliminates that like you you can't three

714
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,720
people can't do the same thing you don't

715
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,559
get the same results and you know the

716
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,480
the manufacturers create this product

717
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,119
that could hold so much moisture but it

718
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
can't hold anything more than that so

719
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,199
you know i like to just saturate it

720
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,278
completely 100 percent

721
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,278
and that's the moisture that it carries

722
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,919
on to about halfway through the rooting

723
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,599
process because it you don't need to re

724
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,400
saturate that media or anything like

725
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,558
that just give it a full saturation with

726
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,080
the right levels of nutrients and root

727
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,440
inoculants

728
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,678
and that's what will carry you through

729
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
the first two stages of rooting and then

730
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,038
get you into

731
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
uh feeding and drying back on the second

732
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,798
half of the rooting stage you said

733
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,679
nutrients as well what nutrients are

734
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,720
they

735
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,759
is recommended for that so traditionally

736
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,880
you know previously for years everybody

737
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,519
fed your

738
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,880
fed their clones of very little food

739
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,639
you're talking

740
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,440
0.5 ec

741
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,000
very very very little food um because

742
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,759
their the mindset was these are babies

743
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,759
they can't handle a lot of food you got

744
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,440
to give them very little food

745
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,599
and the results that they would get were

746
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,519
stunted growth they would need a week to

747
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,798
bounce back after the rooting process

748
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,918
you're creating a deficient plan

749
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,319
essentially

750
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,200
so as far as nutrients go

751
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,038
my rule of thumb is to feed what the

752
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
mother plant you cut from what's being

753
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:09,839
fed

754
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,679
you don't want to change it up because

755
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,759
if you want the same type of growth that

756
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,519
you were getting from that mother plant

757
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,640
and that growth was hitting all your

758
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,918
check marks

759
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
you want the same thing because you're

760
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,799
going to put that back in the veg and

761
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,359
create another plant that looks just

762
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,119
like it so if you change the food up

763
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,719
well now this plant has to get used to

764
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,558
something different maybe doesn't have

765
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,679
everything it needs now it's slowing

766
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,918
down

767
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,919
so my rule of thumb is whatever the

768
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,559
mother plants being fed

769
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,960
for the initial soak it's 50

770
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,158
half of that and then get it into that

771
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,278
regiment that it was being fed

772
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,880
previously and that's how you'll get the

773
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,159
get your clones to look just like the

774
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,919
day they were cut

775
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,200
so that's another part of the sops is

776
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,278
you want your clones to look just like

777
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
the day they were cut you got to mimic

778
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,240
that same type of food and environment

779
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,558
to get it to to that point in 14 days

780
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,640
got it that's good to know

781
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,960
environment let's talk about that

782
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,960
temperature relative humidity they

783
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,759
certainly have an impact on rooting as

784
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,840
well right what's the ideal temperature

785
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,000
and relative humidity for the cloning

786
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,839
process so

787
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,919
we start with the mother room that's

788
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,199
going to be about 78 to 80 degrees and

789
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,399
about 65 humidity so nice breezy warm

790
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,759
summer day

791
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,479
um

792
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,640
you want i like to harden my clones off

793
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,079
to that environment so if you could

794
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,919
clone in your mother room that's uh

795
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,519
ideal you know you don't always need a

796
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,759
separate room with all this extra

797
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,960
humidity and a whole new environment you

798
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,960
could use the same environment that

799
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,798
plants came from because when you put

800
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,919
that dome on it's going to increase your

801
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,158
humidity it's going to increase your

802
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,679
temperature and you you're playing

803
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,360
you're adjusting this micro climate

804
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,038
within this dome

805
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,639
in order to encourage you know all these

806
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,480
uh stages of rooting

807
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
so and then once they're fully done

808
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
they've been acclimated to the same

809
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,039
environment that they came from which is

810
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640
ideal environment for veg so if you know

811
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,720
if you're a commercial producer and

812
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,600
you're setting it off to another grower

813
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,278
well it's been acclimated to a perfect

814
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,599
veg environment that could go into any

815
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,599
other veg environment and thrive so you

816
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,599
don't need to have a big swing of

817
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,839
humidity or anything like that so

818
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:19,839
high 70s 78 80 and 65 humidity um the

819
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,398
environment will will be perfect for

820
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,918
your for your trace and then co2

821
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,239
something that isn't talked about too

822
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,759
much when it comes to cloning but

823
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,079
i know there are some concerns from

824
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,000
people using domes in particular that

825
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,199
they're going to deplete the co2 within

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,720
the dome

827
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,558
is there any can you give us our

828
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,880
thoughts on that and maybe some

829
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,558
suggestions on how often they should be

830
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
opening up the dome or opening up the

831
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,158
the slots in the zone the dome for

832
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,960
aeration purposes for for co2 um

833
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,278
you know i've never really been

834
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,759
concerned about the internal co2 levels

835
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,679
in the dome um you know feeding co2 to

836
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,679
the mother plant the mother stock

837
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,600
i like to match the par levels

838
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,120
so if you're you know running some you

839
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,439
know 630 watt cmhs it'll give you about

840
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,918
five to six hundred depending on the the

841
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,679
height or the canopy level um and you

842
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,038
want to kind of want to match that so

843
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,720
about 600 ppm as well of co2 nothing too

844
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,158
intense if your humidity if your

845
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,159
temperatures and stuff go up or your

846
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,919
light intensity goes up you could you

847
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,120
can increase your co2 as well for those

848
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,080
mother plants

849
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,678
um

850
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,038
but as far as the domes go in that

851
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
little environment

852
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,839
i never like to and i used to do this i

853
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,919
used to you know keep the little vents

854
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,398
closed the first couple days

855
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,720
and you know always do trial and error i

856
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,199
found that's not a best practice i never

857
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,759
want to close that dome 100

858
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,840
um because i i've put meters inside

859
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,158
these domes to really read the internal

860
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,319
environments and with cracking the dome

861
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,480
you saw plenty of humidity

862
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,678
um that the plant needs during the early

863
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,440
stages and yet you're not suffocating it

864
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,000
you're not trapping it so there's still

865
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,120
a little bit of of of airflow and if any

866
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,398
excess hot air needs to rise it has

867
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,278
somewhere to leave

868
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,158
so

869
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,398
i don't like to keep my my vents closed

870
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,760
at all for any period of time really

871
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,158
it's not something i encourage or

872
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,640
recommend okay i personally live in a

873
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
very dry climate i live in the desert

874
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
like i mentioned

875
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,720
currently live in las vegas and it gets

876
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:22,480
super dry here uh 26 is what i'm seeing

877
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,440
right now on my meter so very very dry

878
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
now when i go to clone i do use the

879
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,159
domes

880
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,359
to increase that humidity in that grow

881
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,679
space

882
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,599
and when i do have those vents open

883
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,000
it like gets rid of everything and my

884
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,918
humidity drops what would you say is

885
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
like the lowest humidity that you can

886
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,000
successfully get rooting to happen i

887
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,599
mean i feel you as far as the dry the

888
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,798
dry weather goes i've been down in palm

889
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,480
springs and we're we're you know 10 20

890
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,000
humidity it's it's ridiculous you know

891
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
my sinuses feel it all the time and

892
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,038
stuff too um

893
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,798
but you know if you're in the

894
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,119
environment that the mother plants are

895
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,440
in you know you got some humidity there

896
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,558
but within the dome if you have a full

897
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,320
canopy within the dome those plants will

898
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,720
transpire especially with the moisture

899
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,519
as well in the cubes that will transpire

900
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
and give you enough humidity to to fill

901
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,519
up your your dome worth of humidity

902
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,919
without having to spray the dome

903
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,480
or you know be able to crack the the

904
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,440
domes and still hold humidity so if

905
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
you're

906
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,880
and when i say open i don't mean you

907
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,399
know all the way initially you know just

908
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
you know quarter the way just make sure

909
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,398
it's not 100 closed

910
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,480
but if you're still losing all of you

911
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,398
your humidity i would look at how much

912
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,880
uh how many how much plant material you

913
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,798
have in your tray is it a full tray is

914
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,440
it half a tray because if it's a full

915
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,519
tray and a fully saturated slab and the

916
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,120
vents are cracked slightly you should

917
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,839
hold you should create enough moisture

918
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,439
within that dome um you know to to do

919
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,599
that so i would just say you know fill

920
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,159
up your tray as much as you can

921
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,398
with as much plant material and that

922
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
should help you there and if you have to

923
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,439
close your domes a hundred percent

924
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,199
because it's just not holding um

925
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,519
not you don't want to keep it closed for

926
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,558
more than you know 24 hours you want to

927
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,720
still exchange that air burp the dome

928
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,440
you want to let those plants breathe and

929
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,640
get some fresh oxygen get some fresh

930
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
co2

931
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,519
and and get rid of the the stagnant and

932
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,278
stale uh condensation and humidity

933
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,278
that's being built up

934
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,440
gotcha that makes sense

935
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,440
and then lighting for clones i think

936
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,278
there's some common misconceptions about

937
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,720
lighting for clones

938
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,880
i want to hear your thoughts on that

939
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,278
when do the clones need light how much

940
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,159
light so on and so forth um i like to

941
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,200
keep them on a 24 hour schedule

942
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
um you know you can do 18 six like like

943
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,960
you do your normal veg plants

944
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,199
but what i don't like about that is

945
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,519
during those six hours you've just

946
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,440
changed the internal parameters of your

947
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,038
dome you've increased humidity you've

948
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
reduced temperature because you're not

949
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,158
getting a little bit of ambient

950
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,679
temperature from the light

951
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
so you're changing your parameters

952
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,519
within your dome for you know a third of

953
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,119
the day um

954
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,038
throughout throughout the entire process

955
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,158
so for lighting keep the lights on 24

956
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,038
hours a day

957
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,840
that's my recommendation and four foot

958
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,839
um you know leds or or you know led

959
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,759
lights you know a couple of them on a

960
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,278
four by two tray you could house four

961
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,158
trays on there

962
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,640
six to eight inches above the the dome

963
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,559
it should be spot on um and that should

964
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
be enough light to create the

965
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,558
environment you want within the dome

966
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,480
and then when the domes come off they

967
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,720
could still veg underneath their light

968
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,159
still intense enough to to get some

969
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,919
vegetative growth

970
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,240
if they have to sit for the weekend or

971
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,320
so something like that so for lighting

972
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,679
you could go as easy as something off

973
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:45,439
amazon four foot leds and you know start

974
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,840
there or you go uh get some luxe led

975
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
um four foot lights as well

976
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,839
i don't personally like like the purple

977
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,000
um lights

978
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,119
i've i've tried them and i just didn't

979
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,159
get the same

980
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,239
growth that i wanted out of them um so a

981
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,039
cool blue spectrum

982
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,278
is is what i prefer versus like a deep

983
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,398
red or anything like that okay that's

984
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,159
pretty straightforward

985
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,440
let's get into some of the problems that

986
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,398
can happen purple stems red stems talked

987
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,398
about that in the beginning of the

988
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,279
episode let's circle back and get into

989
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,239
that

990
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,679
what do purple and red stems mean and

991
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,799
how do you get them back to green

992
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,878
you know if if they started green

993
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,119
and they went to purple

994
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,878
you didn't you didn't feed strong enough

995
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,760
in your rooting stage

996
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:33,279
so

997
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,359
if your mother plants were purple to

998
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,560
begin with you're not feeding strong

999
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,559
enough there so it's just going to

1000
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,679
extrapolate that problem in the rooting

1001
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,719
process

1002
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,159
so

1003
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,799
you know in theory if your plants are

1004
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,398
green to begin with and they turn purple

1005
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,159
in your rooting stage yeah you got to

1006
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,239
adjust what you're feeding and what

1007
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,760
you're saturating your trays with and

1008
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,000
more than likely you gotta you gotta

1009
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,000
match what that plant previously was

1010
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,559
getting and that should that should

1011
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,559
address your problems um

1012
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,559
and there's some purple strains that are

1013
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,480
just you know genetically a bit more

1014
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,039
purple stems and that's why i said if

1015
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,880
they start purple and that still met all

1016
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,719
of your other uh you know parameters as

1017
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,880
far as this being a healthy plant then

1018
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,039
that's just you know a purple stem

1019
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,039
genetic and it shouldn't be anything to

1020
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,519
worry about um

1021
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,000
but it's it's usually just a deficiency

1022
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,960
um if you're also getting like yellow

1023
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,679
growth

1024
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,760
on your new newly developed leaves like

1025
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,799
stunted yellow growth that's usually

1026
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,400
micronutrients usually iron and zinc and

1027
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,280
things like that so you know up your

1028
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,800
calmag cow mad cow my cow mag right um

1029
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,519
up those micronutrients and it should

1030
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
address that that stunted uh growth as

1031
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,159
well so you know because purple stem

1032
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,559
you're more than likely gonna also have

1033
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,719
the stunted growth as well up top that

1034
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,880
that short internode space

1035
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,598
that um underdeveloped leave

1036
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,280
and um you know the yellowing and in

1037
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,680
your in your leaves as well so they

1038
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,359
usually go hand in hand which just means

1039
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,759
these plants are hungry these plants are

1040
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,000
hungry you're babying them too much up

1041
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,000
the light up the food and and get them

1042
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,440
uh get that root zone to start up taking

1043
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,760
all those nutrients and give it a little

1044
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,880
bit of time and it'll bounce right back

1045
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,680
i think a lot of people don't know that

1046
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,039
the cal meg does often i can't speak for

1047
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,598
all of them but there are a lot of

1048
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,199
calming formulas that include iron for

1049
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,280
example include some

1050
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,960
macronutrients so you mentioned that

1051
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,640
those could potentially be i'm sorry

1052
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,880
micronutrients so those could

1053
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,598
potentially be the cause for it so yeah

1054
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
when you mentioned calmag that's uh just

1055
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,880
wanted to mention that point as well

1056
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,159
yeah definitely not iron is i was trying

1057
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,400
to think of it when i was speaking but

1058
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,960
it slipped my mind but they got that

1059
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,039
iron and um we'll definitely address all

1060
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
of that and you know should get rid of

1061
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,039
your purple stems and your yellow growth

1062
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,039
which you you shouldn't accept really

1063
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,679
once again if your plant stock to begin

1064
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,880
with was healthy and green and getting

1065
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,879
everything that needs you really

1066
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,400
shouldn't accept the fact that you plan

1067
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,320
to turn in purple or yellow

1068
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,680
in the rooting process it's just not

1069
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,599
necessary

1070
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,679
what are some common mistakes that

1071
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,838
growers make when cloning some common

1072
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,559
mistakes they uh they just kind of let

1073
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,480
it cook right they they ah you know

1074
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,480
close the domes up let the humidity

1075
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,719
increase and they just want to

1076
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,800
they want to give it too much humidity

1077
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,879
on their own by spraying the domes

1078
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,359
keeping them closed you know not

1079
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,599
touching them for for days on end

1080
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,679
that's a big mistake right and it's like

1081
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,760
they they assume that this plant needs a

1082
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,239
hundred percent humidity for five days

1083
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,680
straight and it just doesn't and that's

1084
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,519
that's a huge mistake you'll start

1085
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,440
getting all of the pathogen issues

1086
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,519
you'll get stem rot you have your leaves

1087
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,760
falling over and then when you start to

1088
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,079
acclimate them to you know your normal

1089
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,440
reduced humidity environment

1090
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,119
you're going to get a bunch of stressed

1091
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,200
out plants your leaves are going to curl

1092
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,240
up it's just not going to be it's not

1093
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,358
going to like the big shock and humidity

1094
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,078
so

1095
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,799
you know that's that's a big issue that

1096
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,519
that uh most growers you know do

1097
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
so

1098
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,239
i like to reduce my humidity gradually

1099
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,358
not started too high once again never

1100
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,679
100

1101
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,358
and we acclimate it down to that uh you

1102
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,358
know mother room environment that's 60

1103
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,199
65 humidity

1104
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,519
and you know with those

1105
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,838
um at a certain stage daily burps so

1106
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,079
you're removing that dome you're wiping

1107
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,519
off the excess humidity and you're

1108
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
putting that dome back on and that

1109
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,759
shouldn't be more than you know 15 30

1110
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,160
seconds if you're taking your domes off

1111
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,960
for minutes on end especially in the

1112
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,319
first few days it's another big mistake

1113
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,720
it's just there's just they haven't

1114
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
developed the root zone to hold that

1115
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,959
moisture and drink that moisture up yet

1116
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,440
so earlier on you want to take off your

1117
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,880
domes for very small amount of time but

1118
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,119
you still need to burp those domes and

1119
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,760
get rid of the excess moisture from your

1120
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,599
domes later on you can leave them off

1121
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,800
for a little bit longer because they've

1122
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,200
already got some roots and they're

1123
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
really being acclimated a bit more to

1124
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,519
the environment so

1125
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,280
that's a big mistake just just

1126
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,880
uh you know don't give them too much

1127
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,040
moisture in the beginning just let the

1128
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,680
plants breathe let the plants breathe

1129
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,119
so if clones aren't rooting what are

1130
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,960
some of the things that growers should

1131
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,800
look for or do

1132
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,760
um i mean you got to take a step back

1133
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,920
and look at your environment first right

1134
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,440
you know trust but verify all your

1135
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,200
sensors

1136
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,880
you could even get small sensors that go

1137
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,759
inside the domes and really see what's

1138
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,720
happening within your dome

1139
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,040
look at your your your temperature your

1140
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,559
saturation of your media as well your

1141
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,679
procedures

1142
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,639
you got to really look at everything

1143
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,559
there's not too many aspects to cloning

1144
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,559
but the aspects that are there are are

1145
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,400
very critical and you have to be

1146
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,078
consistent with every step

1147
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,480
so if you're getting inconsistent

1148
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,960
results and you have a team of three

1149
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,719
four or five people cutting plug-in

1150
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,240
you should really go one-on-one with

1151
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,000
them and just and

1152
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,838
watch and observe and see if they're

1153
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,920
really following all the sops or if

1154
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,599
someone's taking a shortcut or someone

1155
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,000
left some plants out you know during

1156
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,519
lunch time for just too much time and

1157
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
all these little things that kind of

1158
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,480
come in mind when managing a team uh you

1159
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,559
know in a nursery the cross

1160
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,960
contamination problem that you spoke

1161
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,519
about before is something that can

1162
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,800
really really do some damage you know

1163
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,318
especially when you're working on one of

1164
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,760
these commercial facilities i mean i've

1165
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,599
seen pictures where

1166
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,520
a person uses the same pair of scissors

1167
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,359
for example and all of a sudden they cut

1168
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,639
clones for a thousand plants and those

1169
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,559
thousand plants

1170
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,719
had a virus or a viroid and so they look

1171
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,239
like complete crap and that's a lot of

1172
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,679
plants to mess up right when you're

1173
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,598
looking at thousands of plants hundreds

1174
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,519
of plants or thousands of plants it

1175
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,880
could do some serious damage there

1176
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,079
talking about cross-contamination a

1177
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,599
little bit more you had something on

1178
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,560
your instagram which i want to bring up

1179
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,480
here

1180
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,880
which is you have a solution

1181
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,119
uh particularly for the hormone gels to

1182
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,440
prevent cross-contamination can you talk

1183
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,000
about that solution yeah absolutely

1184
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,720
um so tradition traditionally

1185
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,079
uh when plugging clones

1186
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,199
most people have always gotten a shot

1187
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,039
glass filled that up with a rooting gel

1188
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,199
and had that uh you know by their side

1189
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,358
as they're grabbing the stem dipping it

1190
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,358
into the shot glass with gel and

1191
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,880
plugging it into your tray

1192
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,598
but what that's doing is creating one

1193
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,519
one central point for all of your stems

1194
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,680
to cross-contaminate and just if there's

1195
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,559
any issues with one plant it's being

1196
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,239
cross-contaminated against everything so

1197
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,078
you know taking a step back

1198
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,519
just just kind of getting creative and

1199
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
say you know what could be the solution

1200
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,639
what's the problem the problem is

1201
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,920
they're sharing that same cup that same

1202
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,199
gel and you've got multiple mother

1203
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,039
plants and stuff

1204
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,519
so what's the solution well we still

1205
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,880
need gel in the stems right we don't we

1206
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,440
can't share them

1207
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,358
but uh you know just in in racking my

1208
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,880
brain and brainstorming a little bit

1209
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,039
i came up with a

1210
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,880
a solution that i put the gel inside of

1211
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,759
a ketchup bottle a squeeze ketchup

1212
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,559
bottle

1213
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,359
and all of the the cells and the trays

1214
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,880
have pre-made holes for your stems so

1215
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,880
that fit perfectly for the squeeze

1216
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,680
bottle so i just give it a little

1217
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,838
squeeze and i'm filling up the the cubes

1218
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,399
the cube holes the stem holes with the

1219
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,838
gel versus uh sharing the cup and

1220
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,119
dipping everything individually in that

1221
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,679
shared cup

1222
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,519
so now that stem doesn't share anything

1223
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,039
else it goes right into its own cube

1224
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,800
with its own gel

1225
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,880
and doesn't share anything else and you

1226
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
repeat the process and all of a sudden

1227
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,760
you're not sharing the gel anymore so

1228
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,919
it's it's critical for when like you

1229
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,599
know you have an issue or you you know

1230
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,358
you're you're suspected of having a

1231
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,599
viral issue anything that's really

1232
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:26,559
transferable uh physically which that

1233
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,240
gel will just house all of that so that

1234
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,679
ketchup bottle tech whether you know

1235
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,279
whatever we want to call it here it's

1236
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,719
it's uh it works and it's enough to like

1237
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,400
create you know

1238
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,759
a new solution

1239
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
and you know that may trigger a

1240
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,359
different solution or something else in

1241
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,359
the future but for now it solves a

1242
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,440
problem as far as sharing that cup of

1243
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,960
gel right it solves that problem that's

1244
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,519
a really cool solution i'm glad you

1245
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,880
shared that with us today because uh

1246
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,559
the first time i've ever seen it

1247
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,559
previously you know you'd always pour

1248
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,159
fresh and you never reuse you never

1249
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,920
poured back into the bottle was like hey

1250
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,399
i'm doing good right i'm not i'm not

1251
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,760
reusing gel and stuff but it's like

1252
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,200
you had a you know when you're in a

1253
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,040
facility and stuff you have to get

1254
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,239
creative and you have to be cost

1255
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,079
efficient too

1256
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,879
i mean a squeeze ketchup bottle on

1257
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,640
amazon is a couple bucks i mean and as

1258
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,240
far as time goes you know i was talking

1259
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,358
to the the staff that i previously

1260
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,719
managed and it was it was easy it wasn't

1261
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,759
too much of a

1262
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:24,959
burden on them as far as procedures go

1263
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,720
time goes labor goes it's a quick step

1264
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,240
they're doing 50 squeeze squeeze squeeze

1265
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,399
and squeeze you know a couple minutes

1266
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,399
later boom they're rocking and it saves

1267
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,000
them saves them a bit of time and quite

1268
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,079
honestly it it's

1269
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,480
it's better because once you uh once

1270
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,240
that that cup of gel gets used a little

1271
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,599
bit it's kind of you know stems are

1272
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,039
coming from liquid so there's always a

1273
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,960
little bit of liquid on the bottom of

1274
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,960
the stems that goes into the gel and

1275
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,119
that doesn't allow the gel to cling onto

1276
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,920
your stem very well so you have to put

1277
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,079
more gel that's drier so it clings to

1278
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
your stem so that solves that problem as

1279
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,599
well because once you're bringing a

1280
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,599
little bit of moisture into this gel cup

1281
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,079
the the effectiveness of that gel

1282
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,280
clinging to your stem is like almost nil

1283
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,200
cleaner faster safer cheaper yeah it's

1284
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,640
like and some people were like oh you

1285
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,159
know it looks like you're using too much

1286
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,000
gel and stuff

1287
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,000
look that's that's an easy adjustment

1288
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,679
right and if you pour an eye pour you

1289
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,960
know into the the same thing we may be a

1290
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,960
little bit different

1291
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,039
but that's an easy adjustment you can

1292
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,639
make for all the benefits you gain that

1293
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,000
we just described yeah i'm definitely

1294
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,759
gonna have to buy a ketchup bottle or

1295
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
two

1296
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,319
all right so kind of getting towards the

1297
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,239
end of the podcast here we went over a

1298
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,759
lot a lot of good tips talk to us how

1299
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,358
can the listeners find you and what do

1300
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,839
you have upcoming in the future

1301
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,159
yeah absolutely um instagram i try to be

1302
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,519
active on there as much as i can so uh

1303
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,159
clung coach

1304
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,639
on instagram uh my youtube channel is

1305
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,078
barely getting its its wheels moving

1306
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,920
i'm learning how to do all this video

1307
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,318
recording editing you know script

1308
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
writing it's it's a lot to take on but

1309
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,519
uh it's something that i have on my

1310
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
agenda so on youtube clone coach as well

1311
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,838
and um you know so i offer uh rooting

1312
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,838
program and clone coaching so you know

1313
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,838
in the nursery end of things from a

1314
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,358
commercial scale you know i've been

1315
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,318
cutting plugging and selling clones

1316
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,719
since 2015 so i i understand the

1317
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,000
managing aspect the production aspect um

1318
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:15,358
you know the market aspect and
