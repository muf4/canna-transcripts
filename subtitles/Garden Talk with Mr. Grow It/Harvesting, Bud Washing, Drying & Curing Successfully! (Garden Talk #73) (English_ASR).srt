1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
coming up on garden talk you're going to

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,359
leave that plant matter on there to help

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
give the plant a little moisture and

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,960
enhance or extend that dry period it's

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
the exact same thing with trying to

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,240
remove the dirt from your hands you

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,480
can't just use water you have to use

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,719
soap the baking soda and the lemon juice

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,719
work together as an agent to remove that

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,198
kind of grime without using the word

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,439
soap there was no other way to harvest

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,679
your herb it was wait for that stem to

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,079
snap it took me two harvests to realize

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,079
that is way too late if you've lost the

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,640
moisture in the stem

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,520
the buds are done in the first two weeks

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,039
of cure does this much to its smoke

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,520
ability but giving it a month

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,759
i think does that to its smoke ability

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,600
two weeks minimum but a month cure and

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,599
you're laughing you're laughing

22

over the last say 12

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,879
plant

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
and uh it it's allowed me to you know

141
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,839
kind of double down on my own processes

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,160
and make question some of my techniques

143
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,119
but uh nonetheless you know i'm i'm on

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
media presence hope to hit a hundred

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
thousand subs maybe perhaps by the next

149
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,639
time someone sees this i'm already there

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
um but uh yeah and it's been it's been

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,439
an incredible journey to say the least

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,759
but uh still grinding doubling down on

153
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,839
uh on just being a a full-time content

154
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,840
creator awesome sweet

155
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,119
so let's get into let's start with

156
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,638
harvesting

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,038
um so the first question i have for you

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,079
is how do you determine when to harvest

159
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,519
your plants there's so many different

160
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,680
ways to go about it right i know some

161
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,120
people look at the trichomes some people

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,240
will look at the actual pistols of the

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
plant because maybe they don't have a

164
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
microscope to look at the trichomes some

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,839
will just look at the plants and see if

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
the leaves are fading you know the plant

167
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,679
we're talking about the medicinal plant

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,360
is an annual plant so no matter how much

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
nutrients you feed it eventually it's

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
going to fade how do you go about

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,439
determining when to harvest your plants

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
uh you know it's a great question i i

173
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
think if if anyone's been following me

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,199
for a minute they they know that i'm not

175
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,918
a scientific man

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
i'm really a hands-on kind of guy and

177
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,959
the number one factor that comes to

178
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,918
harvest is it's going to come down to

179
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,279
your time you know um often i find that

180
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,359
i would love to be able to harvest a

181
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,119
plant when it's when it's at its optimal

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,879
when those trichomes are at their most

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,879
efficient they're like that i prefer a

184
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,879
cloudy trichome you know when that fade

185
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,038
is really starting to take on when you

186
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,079
notice that it's taking less water it's

187
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,399
taking less nutrients um all great signs

188
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,478
but you know often enough i kind of get

189
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,879
caught up with life and and

190
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
work and and family

191
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,159
and next thing you know i'm either

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
harvesting it too early harvesting it a

193
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,599
little bit too late um speeding up the

194
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,439
process taking some corners um but but

195
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,439
if i was to have the optimal optimal

196
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,598
harvest time it would be as i mentioned

197
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,839
you know i'm looking for less intake on

198
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,478
water i'm looking for that plant to show

199
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,239
me that it's ready for ready for harvest

200
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,800
and typically it's going to come down to

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,918
the water consumption the the trichome

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
colors that that majority of milky

203
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,598
trichomes you're going to see a slight

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
hinge of that that amber and you're

205
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,319
going to see a little bit of a immature

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,038
clear trichome as well but all of those

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
things coming together lets me know that

208
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,399
it's going to be it's going to be right

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,960
for harvest and i'm looking through a

210
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,878
microscope to get a good close look

211
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,638
probably should ask this first but do

212
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,720
you flush your plants very common

213
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,639
technique i know you're a precision

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
grower with synthetic nutrients so

215
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
you're not really doing the organic side

216
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,319
of things a common technique is to flush

217
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,800
your plants or

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
leech your plants prior to harvesting

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
whether that be seven days prior to

220
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,319
harvesting two weeks prior to harvesting

221
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
i know some people go longer than that

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,560
i've seen upwards of 21 days to where

223
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
they're just cutting off nutrients and

224
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,639
just feeding plain water for the rest of

225
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,519
the grow or some people running gallons

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
of water through the medium in order to

227
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,519
remove as much of those nutrients as

228
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,758
possible and then allowing the plant to

229
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,799
fade after that do you do any type of

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,320
flushing before you harvest your plant

231
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,918
um well

232
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
i wouldn't say before i think it's kind

233
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,439
of a technical term but i wouldn't say i

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,519
i think flushing is actually the

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,320
beginning of harvest um now yeah i do i

236
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,440
do flush because i personally personally

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,120
believe that you should maximize every

238
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
moment every day that you get in the

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,360
garden you should be maximizing that in

240
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
terms of giving it as much food as

241
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,839
possible trying to give it as much light

242
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
as it can handle until that very last

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,880
moment and that's where i find flushing

244
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,278
is the most effective is when you are

245
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,278
pushing the limits so i like to most

246
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,559
plant most flowers are going until about

247
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,120
week nine

248
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,199
i'm pushing right till week nine when i

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,278
see that it's ready to harvest boom

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,640
that's when it's a nice hard stop of

251
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,559
nutrients and that's when i'm trying to

252
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,799
back down on those so it's

253
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,039
it's typically a flush like i know it is

254
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,439
a flush not a leech so it's you know uh

255
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,000
in three times of the water the amount

256
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,560
of the pot is kind of the rule of thumb

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,879
and that that's typically going to last

258
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,359
about seven days and not a whole lot

259
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,639
longer than well you know seven to ten

260
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,240
it's hard to write anything down in

261
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,000
stone but seven between seven and ten

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
days i can get two good heavy water

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,159
flushes in that time and then it's gonna

264
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,360
it's gonna get to a dried out state

265
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,439
enough where it's

266
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,278
it's harvestable gotcha so you're

267
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
flushing your plants how do you go about

268
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,838
harvesting what's your process

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,519
well you know the last few harvests that

270
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,000
i've had i've actually changed up my

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,919
method i because of the podcast you know

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240
i've been opened up to the idea of not

273
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,958
only tent growing but

274
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,879
growing via a screen as well now i don't

275
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,000
want to use the actual term for

276
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,159
censorship reasons um but you know

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,039
growing via a screen i find it really

278
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,319
maximizes space maximizes plant um

279
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,278
optimize or

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
size

281
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,480
and that has introduced new methods for

282
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,278
me you know uh typically i've always on

283
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,120
a wet trim

284
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,838
chop the plant

285
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,639
trim it dry it and away it go

286
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,240
now i decided to do a full plant dry

287
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,639
where i would try to keep the plant

288
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,799
intact as much as i could trim it at its

289
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,078
base hang it upside down and then let it

290
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,799
dry

291
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,799
i found that i got a few more days out

292
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,599
of the dry but

293
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,919
not much not much i got a few extra days

294
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,320
but not not a whole lot so but but again

295
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,319
the few extra days is uh is a is a

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,879
breaking point and and one in which i

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,360
like it's a sale i'll take that extra

298
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,439
days every day so um i did see a

299
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
difference there but typically right

300
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,920
after the right after i find she's ready

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,839
to go she's gonna get uh chopped hung in

302
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:14,078
a tent um in in approximately

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,320
uh you know 60 degrees freedom units 65

304
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,000
degrees freedom units um and then i'm

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,640
going to push around the humidity is

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,958
going to sit around that 60 percent as

307
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,559
well uh it's difficult being in the

308
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,599
corner of the basement where i'm at is

309
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,919
to like

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
heavily maintain that

311
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,799
so that's a plus minus

312
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,720
5

313
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,919
10

314
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,000
but generally speaking cool dark

315
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,519
and not too damp

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,759
anything over 70 and you're kind of

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
going to battle that that moisture that

318
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,000
mold issue

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,399
um so definitely kind of kind of push in

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
that 70 percent but really you know

321
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,639
giving it that buffer so i think 60 is a

322
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,440
good good humidity number and that that

323
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,159
lasted for about seven days this time

324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,800
okay and you mentioned that you

325
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,958
prefer to cut the plant at the base so

326
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,799
at the stalk and hang the plant whole i

327
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,559
think you brought up a great point i

328
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,159
personally live in a desert climate it's

329
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,559
very very dry here i'm looking at my

330
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,719
humidity monitor it's at 24

331
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,719
so that's extremely low compared to

332
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
other parts uh you know other climates

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
out there so i do the same thing to

334
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,920
where i'm cutting at the base

335
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,240
allowing the plant to be fully intact

336
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,319
all the branches the the buds are still

337
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,200
intact to that even the leaves are kind

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,879
of overlapping some of the buds and it

339
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,480
retains moisture a little bit better

340
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,480
than it would be to you know trim off

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
the leaves for example cut individual

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,480
branches and hang them individually that

343
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,000
would lead to a more faster dry and i'm

344
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
always battling with low humidity i'm

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,958
always battling a proper dry

346
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
time which we're going to get into

347
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,679
drying in a little bit but just wanted

348
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,000
to emphasize that is that the

349
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,159
cutting it at the base versus cutting

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
individual branches you can definitely

351
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,958
conserve that moisture and increase the

352
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,879
dry time a little bit if you need to if

353
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,879
that's beneficial for your climate for

354
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,639
example so i'm glad you mentioned that

355
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,159
one the more plant matter that's on

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,320
there that's alive and not dead and

357
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,519
crusty and and and you know wilted

358
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
you're gonna leave that plant matter on

359
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
there to help

360
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,359
give the plant a little moisture and

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,278
enhance or extend that dry period so i

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,079
believe the same concept can be applied

363
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,000
to doing a dry versus a wet trim if i if

364
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,599
i keep the trim until the dry i've

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,759
maximized the plant material on the

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,159
plant therefore giving myself a little

367
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,879
more of a of a

368
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,199
a head start or a little more advantage

369
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,480
when it comes to the end dried product

370
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
you know i want more time that's what i

371
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,039
want more time so if i dry trim

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
it's it's it's gotten the most amount of

373
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,319
time out of that so i prefer a dry trim

374
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,078
and not to mention you can get a little

375
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
more tighter to the buds

376
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,599
drying trimming you know it's it's a lot

377
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,360
easier you can you literally i barely

378
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
even feel like you cut you just kind of

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,159
like slide the trimmers along the buds

380
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,679
and like all those fan leaves can kind

381
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,559
of just kind of come off all in their

382
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,958
own

383
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
so yeah it's a lot easier i feel i find

384
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,399
i'm sure there's going to be a lot of

385
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,240
debate in the comments section about wet

386
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,039
trim versus dry trim and people like

387
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
what

388
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,120
true wet trim is easier what are you

389
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,320
talking about you're crazy so i think it

390
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,120
definitely comes down to personal

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,000
preference on that one always now

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,278
after you cut the plant down at the base

393
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,879
one of the things you're known for

394
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,519
you're very known for you had one of the

395
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,519
top viewed videos of all time on youtube

396
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,759
which was bud washing

397
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,000
can you talk to us about what is bud

398
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,879
washing and why do it

399
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,639
yeah it's crazy because i get i get

400
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,879
afforded the guy that buzz washes his

401
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,919
butt like it's like it was my idea but

402
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,078
it wasn't it wasn't my idea i i'm glad

403
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,559
to take all the the credit for it uh but

404
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,078
no it was actually uh there was a there

405
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,879
was a guy i followed by the name of doc

406
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,799
buds way back when i was in the forum

407
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,799
days when i was before i was vlogging

408
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,679
and when i was blogging

409
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,159
and um you know he i i don't even know

410
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,679
if he can take credit for it um you know

411
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,039
he he's the one that introduced me to it

412
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,239
but essentially

413
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,838
um

414
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,680
i i'm one of the first ones that put a

415
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
video of it on youtube that's really

416
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,078
what it came down to

417
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,799
and

418
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,958
it's it's essentially a process of of

419
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,639
handling your flour like it's no

420
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,559
different than a tomato or a potato or

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
an onion you know you wash it when you

422
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,518
get it out of the ground you know it's

423
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,000
dirty um and and so

424
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,879
you know i i that same concepts applied

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,879
to to harvesting your plants uh

426
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,399
up until as of just a couple harvests

427
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,278
ago i washed every single harvest that i

428
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,320
had

429
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:41,039
um and you know you go you do so by

430
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,720
combining three buckets typically it's

431
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,519
five gallon pails

432
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,759
one of those pails has a cup of baking

433
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,480
soda and a cup of

434
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,000
lemon juice in it the other two are just

435
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,920
plain room temperature water and you you

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,078
go about you know you chop your plants

437
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,639
immediately after harvest you chop your

438
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,719
buds into you know arm size so they can

439
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
fit in a bucket and yeah you dunk it in

440
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,120
the the lemon juice and the the baking

441
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,078
soda water first and you're giving it a

442
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,360
good swirl because you are trying to er

443
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:16,000
eliminate the the dust the hair the

444
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
grime the bugs that get that are

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,360
inherently getting on your plant

446
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,519
and and so you would then

447
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
let it dry or not dry but drip dry a

448
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
little bit over the first bucket apply

449
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
it to the second bucket

450
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,319
again getting now you're trying to get

451
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,120
off the the mixture of both the baking

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,278
soda and the lemon juice um and then you

453
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,799
you you let that drip dry and and again

454
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,519
in the third bucket to do the same thing

455
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,078
to kind of just rinse rinse the uh the

456
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,919
mixture off um the biggest concern from

457
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,359
people is well aren't you wiping off

458
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,599
trichomes aren't you washing off

459
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
trichomes and the reality is yeah of

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,639
course you are uh there are some dead

461
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,480
and degraded trichomes that are present

462
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
on those plants there always will be

463
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,759
from from from the beginning you know

464
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,720
trichomes are present on plants almost

465
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
immediately uh from from germination

466
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
from seed

467
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
and almost all the way through veg

468
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,079
you are going to have trichomes those

469
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,720
trichomes although single cell trichomes

470
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,480
are going to degrade over the course of

471
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,798
the flower period those are going to be

472
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
dead they have no effect they have

473
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,519
they've degraded past any point of you

474
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,799
know cbn or cbd or

475
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,078
any kind of

476
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,759
after product of thc and so

477
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,918
when you do the rinse those are going to

478
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,720
fall off generally speaking when you

479
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,440
hang them to dry and and and and they

480
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,960
bang about and they they they

481
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
go through the process they're losing

482
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,519
trichomes every stage of the way uh

483
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,240
that's a reality um

484
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,000
so but did it have a negative impact on

485
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,279
the plants itself and the trichomes the

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,160
potency absolutely not absolutely not i

487
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,079
i smoked some incredible herb

488
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
that was washed you know

489
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,839
the the there is no in my opinion

490
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
there's no argument to whether it

491
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,959
diminishes the potency

492
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,519
but

493
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,720
what opened my eyes in terms of whether

494
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,359
or not everybody whether it was required

495
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,519
for every single harvest was performing

496
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,038
my last couple harvests i did it via

497
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:21,359
tent i have great circulation via my ac

498
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,038
infinities um i've got a a quality lung

499
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,159
room and that's the room in which both

500
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,879
my tents reside where it's it's sealed

501
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
and the environments within are sealed

502
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
it's it's a room within a room you know

503
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
it's like

504
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,319
i i noticed that there wasn't as much of

505
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
a need i i

506
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,960
to wash your buds there was no there was

507
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,798
minimally minimal hair there was hair

508
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,279
don't i'm not saying that it wasn't it

509
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,079
was just completely sterile there was

510
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,240
hair but i didn't see the amount that i

511
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,558
was seeing before

512
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,319
i i was growing in a tent so i whether

513
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,119
or not

514
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,720
i one should wash every harvest or not

515
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,399
that's up to them i think it comes down

516
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,679
to personal preference i'm not gonna be

517
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,160
the guy that tells you that you should

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,759
or shouldn't i did sit on on on a

519
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,679
pedestal and say that i wouldn't smoke

520
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,319
anyone else's because they didn't wash

521
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,679
it

522
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,359
um i i'll backtrack those statements

523
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,640
however i want to know that the stuff

524
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,639
that i ingest is going to be uh is going

525
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
to be clean regardless i want to know

526
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
that it doesn't come in contact with

527
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,679
pesticides i want to know that it was

528
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
grown in a sterile environment i want to

529
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
know that it's free from disease all

530
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
these things and i think that it being

531
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
clean

532
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,679
is just a is another variable and it's a

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,519
valid one but it doesn't need to be

534
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,640
applied to everybody's

535
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,798
stash

536
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,960
i don't think a lot of people know that

537
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,000
tricoms as they go to different stages

538
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,079
right clear cloudy amber they actually

539
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,558
get to the point where they become more

540
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,399
brittle and actually snap off so

541
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,599
actually fall off so like you mentioned

542
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
those are the ones that you're washing

543
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,959
off right now

544
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,759
i gotta challenge you on this one for

545
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,480
the folks that prefer more amber maybe

546
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,919
they prefer like 30 amber for example or

547
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
more

548
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,240
would you say that

549
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,400
they shouldn't bud wash because there's

550
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,640
more jeopardy of them removing those

551
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,919
trichomes with the cbn for example you

552
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,720
know um i i would i would have to know

553
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,880
what the integrity of those amber

554
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,038
trichomes really are and at what point

555
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,640
do they degrade to a point where they're

556
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,679
breaking but again

557
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,759
you know

558
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
i don't know man i'm not a science guy

559
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,079
the thing is is that it's like you want

560
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,480
to have clean product if if you're if

561
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,240
you're growing in a in an area that

562
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,200
you're not confident

563
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,120
is producing sterile clean product wash

564
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
it don't don't question it don't

565
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,479
question it just be it should be clean

566
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,798
that's what that's my again that's

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
that's in my own opinion but um if

568
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,639
you're on the fence do you think you're

569
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,200
growing in a in a state that's clean you

570
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,120
you prefer that cbn you want those those

571
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
amber trichomes we'll just grow in a

572
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,719
tent grow in a tent with good air

573
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,159
circulation keep your hands out of there

574
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
don't drool all over your plants and

575
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
you're gonna be okay

576
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,399
going back to the first bucket you

577
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,399
talked about you talked about three

578
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,440
different buckets the first one has

579
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,798
creekman from wrong it's baking soda and

580
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,440
lemon juice

581
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,879
what exactly is the point of that

582
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,840
wouldn't just plain water all the way

583
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,320
through be okay or essentially trichomes

584
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,319
are water soluble it's like oil so you

585
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,399
you you're not going to lose anything

586
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,839
it's going to repel a lot of the water

587
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,919
so the water alone isn't going to get in

588
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,480
and remove anything it's going to just

589
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
be pushed away by the the oils if you

590
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,038
will

591
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:35,759
the now i'm reaching for this one but

592
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,038
it's the the baking soda is a natural

593
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,798
soaping agent

594
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,919
where it's going to sudden it's going to

595
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:45,038
get into the the crevices to remove the

596
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,520
hair the lemon juice juice is a natural

597
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,079
antiseptic which is then going to clean

598
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,720
and it's going to it's going to help

599
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,720
remove and rinse the grime away so

600
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,038
working together

601
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,200
it's it's a pair that that that works to

602
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,279
just work as like a soap if you will and

603
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,038
i hate the reason i'm hesitating here is

604
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,918
because i know people like to grab your

605
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,519
words so if i say soap they're gonna

606
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,440
they're gonna that's exactly it's what's

607
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,440
happening with soap it's the exact same

608
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
thing with trying to remove the dirt

609
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
from your hands you can't just use water

610
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,918
you have to use soap the baking soda and

611
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,798
the lemon juice work together as an

612
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,799
agent to remove that kind of grime

613
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,798
without using the word soap but that's

614
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,558
it that's it okay and then when you dunk

615
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,000
those branches into the water you

616
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,038
mentioned you got to give it a good

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
swirl

618
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,558
can you put them on time to it are you

619
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
talking five seconds worth of it are you

620
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,440
talking 10 seconds 20 seconds what how

621
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,440
long yeah seven seconds seven seconds in

622
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,798
you're swirling just trying to get in

623
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
you can you know

624
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,079
and then you're out so five seconds

625
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
you're out you're in it's yeah you're

626
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,359
not much more in there you again you

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,759
you're not losing anything but you're

628
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,879
not trying to abuse the plant either

629
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,038
which which

630
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
could definitely happen okay so five

631
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,038
seconds up to seven seconds is that is

632
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,798
that pretty easy bucket or is that for

633
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,798
the first bucket with the okay for each

634
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,558
bucket gotcha yep because you want it

635
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,798
you want a thorough rinse

636
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,759
and now is this gonna make the drying

637
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,240
time longer no no it doesn't it doesn't

638
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,759
make it longer at all in fact um if

639
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,839
there's anything i've noticed and then

640
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,679
this is where you know it's it every

641
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,079
harvest is a little different

642
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,559
some will argue that it's it has sped up

643
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,000
their drying um i haven't experienced

644
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,519
that per se

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
but i think it comes down really to your

646
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,400
environment um i always have a hard time

647
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,199
getting to five days dry it's typically

648
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,038
three

649
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
three to five days and it's dry

650
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,879
i was finding the exact same thing on

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,319
harvests where i wasn't

652
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,240
washing it's three to five days that's

653
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,000
kind of an unwritten rule and it sucks

654
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,679
it's way too fast but now that i'm

655
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
drying in a tent we can get to this

656
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,480
later it's it's definitely changed that

657
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,480
that time but no it does not enhance the

658
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
dry okay i actually found the same exact

659
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,360
thing i was just curious on on your

660
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,640
findings there i bud washed

661
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,038
honestly it's only been about two or

662
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,960
three plants and uh you know i did the

663
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,798
same exact method i used where i had the

664
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
multiple buckets

665
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,759
swirled it in i probably swirled in it

666
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,038
for about the same amount of time that

667
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,798
you mentioned and then hang in those

668
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,798
individual branches i found it was was

669
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,480
about the same dry time so interesting

670
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,480
to hear that you had the same findings

671
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,640
there and i think like kind of reverting

672
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
back to the cut the the trimming process

673
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
i think a lot of that had to do with the

674
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,519
fact that we're trimming each and every

675
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,039
branch you know and that's inherently

676
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,400
that's going to speed up the dry

677
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,079
significantly so if you if you people

678
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,159
have asked ball could you wash the whole

679
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,399
plant and it's like well if you're gonna

680
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,919
if you're gonna make a bucket big enough

681
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
you know but then you're wasting you're

682
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,278
wasting water you're wasting time

683
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,759
filling a bathtub to wash a plant i

684
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,960
don't think it's necessary but yeah i

685
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,960
think a lot of that had to do with the

686
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,798
trimming it's so small okay so if you

687
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,079
you've washed your buds then now they're

688
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,558
ready for drying how is your drying area

689
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,599
set up it's it's almost exactly like the

690
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,158
growing setup was um minus the light you

691
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,918
know i've still got the air circuit well

692
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,840
okay okay let me let me walk that back a

693
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
little bit there's a lot less wind

694
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,240
circulation that's for sure um in my

695
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,760
flowering tent there is a lot of wind i

696
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
don't think honestly you could light a

697
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,558
lighter

698
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
in in my flowering tent without it kind

699
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,879
of like flickering out you know because

700
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,319
i'm trying to move so much air i'm

701
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,919
trying to do the opposite of that when

702
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,720
i'm start trying to dry you know there's

703
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,159
no fans on uh except for

704
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,519
the the

705
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,799
my uh

706
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,319
i just called my c infinity my inline

707
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,759
people in my comments section were

708
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,038
saying that i didn't need to have that

709
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,000
on as well

710
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,839
but being in the basement being at 60

711
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
percent moisture i've got an active

712
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,119
humid

713
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,200
humidifier in there it

714
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,199
does not make sense to me to not

715
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
circulate that air in there in some form

716
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
or fashion sealing it off for two weeks

717
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,278
just seems like

718
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
just just a calling card for moisture

719
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,759
and mold and taking all that work and

720
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,119
just getting rid of it so so i i think

721
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,640
you know i did it right again i'm very

722
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,918
inexperienced when it comes to tent

723
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
growing i've always grown in a room

724
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,240
that's like eight by ten feet by eight

725
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,918
feet high you know very large room so

726
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
being in a four by four space i've

727
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,480
learned a lot and

728
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:14,079
both through experiment and failure so

729
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,880
this time i do believe that i went about

730
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,519
it correctly but i did keep one small

731
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
fan on at the very bottom of the tent

732
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,918
um

733
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,079
i don't think that was necessary i think

734
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,320
i should have just left the ac infinity

735
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,798
on and nothing else but

736
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:32,000
um yeah humidity in the tent was set at

737
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:35,038
about 60 percent um it fluctuated plus

738
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,038
minus about six i saw 66 and i saw about

739
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,440
54 50

740
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,480
so it did fluctuate it's very tough to

741
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,600
maintain

742
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,679
um i'm only running a small um

743
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,480
humidifier that holds maybe a little

744
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,240
less than a gallon maybe a gallon

745
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,599
and it's a real pain in the butt trying

746
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
to you know you gotta you gotta open

747
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,839
that tent up every 24 hours to fill that

748
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,319
humidifier

749
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,278
and it just it's plus minus and and it's

750
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,399
really unfortunate and that's as close

751
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,519
as i've been to a perfect dry

752
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,080
ever and it was still plus minus six to

753
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,079
ten humidity and and temperature your

754
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,599
dry setup sounds very similar to mine

755
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,359
like i mentioned earlier in the episode

756
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,359
i live in a very dry climate so i'm

757
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,199
always battling trying to increase the

758
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,079
humidity not only in my flower room and

759
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,240
stuff but drying as well so primarily i

760
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
dry in a grow tent i've tried in open

761
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,839
rooms before i drive in bathrooms before

762
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,038
because that was all that was available

763
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,038
kind of gross when you think about all

764
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,960
the germs and bacteria that might be

765
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,038
floating around in that bathroom but

766
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,079
that's besides the point

767
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,319
but normally it would be in a grow tent

768
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,839
very similar i've got a humidifier at

769
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,759
the bottom of the tent

770
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,519
blowing up towards not towards the

771
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,679
plants i usually blow it up towards the

772
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,200
side of the grow tent and then i have a

773
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,200
oscillating fan on the bottom of the

774
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,720
tent now the oscillating fan isn't

775
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,798
blowing air directly onto the buds i

776
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,159
found that it dries it out a lot quicker

777
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,918
when it's flowing directly on the buds

778
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,919
but allowing the

779
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,000
humidifier to blow that humidity against

780
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,759
the wall and a combination of having the

781
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,798
oscillating fan there it does

782
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,679
sufficiently add the flow around the

783
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,079
drying tent and then i also have the top

784
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,759
ventilation sock open

785
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,000
on the drying tent now i don't have an

786
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,079
inline fan hooked up to mine i just

787
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
basically have that oscillating fan

788
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,199
going and then

789
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
air is just naturally come flowing out

790
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
through the top now sometimes what i'll

791
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,278
do is i'll crack that grow tent saw the

792
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,439
airflow that way as well if needed

793
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,038
every 24 hours i'm going in there and

794
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,200
checking to make sure that i'm

795
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,278
exchanging the air entirely if there's

796
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,919
any sort of musky smell

797
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,159
i will uh i'll definitely take action

798
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,880
then you know air it out

799
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,640
maybe i'll have to lower the

800
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,559
humidity that's coming out of the

801
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,640
humidifier and then i also have a

802
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,558
temperature humidity monitor i use the

803
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
sensor push monitor and actually hang

804
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,200
that right down with the plants and so

805
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,278
it'll be at the level where the buds are

806
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,519
and i get alerts to my smartphone so

807
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,278
anytime the humidity is off anytime the

808
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,599
temperature is off

809
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,599
then i will be able to take action i

810
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,759
don't do anything in order to

811
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,798
increase the temperature or decrease the

812
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,558
temperature

813
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,440
naturally room temperature for me i'm

814
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,798
usually about 65 70 degrees fahrenheit

815
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,880
and that's usually fine i know some

816
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,960
people really like to go lower than that

817
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,799
you know 60 degrees fahrenheit for

818
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
example it's tough for me to get that

819
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,759
low without adding in

820
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,759
a air conditioner or running the central

821
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,879
air in my house which of course costs

822
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,558
money and stuff so i think there's kind

823
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,600
of a balancing act in there do you have

824
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,440
to add in any sort of cooling or i'll

825
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,359
say it heating as well

826
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,679
yeah heating yeah great canadian

827
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,879
argument uh yeah yeah i'm in the

828
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,200
basement and it's it's naturally pretty

829
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,880
chilly i i can't transition into freedom

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,480
units but i'm going to say that like it

831
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
just

832
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,599
like on average it's probably about

833
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,200
low 60s high 50s in my basement all the

834
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,079
time all the time

835
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,000
and sure that might be great for a for a

836
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,839
drying you know

837
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
but that's not good for for veg for sure

838
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,558
and you know

839
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,080
flowering in general you know you do

840
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,240
want to have a little more control on it

841
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,480
so i do actually have in my lung room i

842
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,919
have a space heater that runs all the

843
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,038
time and keeps the room at about a 70

844
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,480
yeah about 70 and uh it works really

845
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,599
well the space

846
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,079
my lung room is my old grow room so it's

847
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,678
it's about eight by eight by ten

848
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,599
and you know that little space heater

849
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,679
with the two four by four tents in it

850
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,918
works perfect perfect and it's on the

851
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,240
outside of the tents so that enter that

852
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,320
that air is getting sucked into the

853
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,679
tents and then and yeah like i also

854
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,158
drain a tent i didn't say that i also

855
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,960
drain a tent and uh i really enjoy it

856
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,399
like i is ac infinity a sponsor here

857
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,319
yeah oh yeah

858
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:53,199
yeah good yeah shout out to ac infinity

859
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,359
man and and using promo code mr growit

860
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
uh or which whichever one it is but

861
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,599
anyways

862
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,519
perfect um it's uh i love it man they've

863
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,960
got the the smart controller can read

864
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,278
everything on my phone it's got the

865
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,679
diode that goes down into the tent so i

866
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,599
can see or i can read how much exactly

867
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,480
the temperature is how much the moisture

868
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,319
is i can adjust the speed on it so

869
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
depending on how fast you want it i put

870
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,200
it on one

871
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,599
and it worked perfect this was this was

872
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,558
a great dry i was almost worried that i

873
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,000
had over dried at some stage but nah

874
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,440
everything came out really well i might

875
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,558
actually over burped it here just the

876
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,558
other day but

877
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,240
leave it up to me to fail but uh no the

878
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,879
inline i really think makes a world of a

879
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,880
difference when it comes to drying

880
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,360
nice nice so you mentioned your drying

881
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,200
setup your drying conditions

882
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,599
how long you drive for

883
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
how do you know when they're done drying

884
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,359
that's a good question

885
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
i remember when i first got into

886
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,519
doing youtube everybody always said wait

887
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,679
for that stem to snap

888
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,919
and that was it there was no other way

889
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,080
to harvest your herb it was wait for

890
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,000
that stem to snap it took me two or

891
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,480
maybe two harvests to realize that is

892
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,079
way too late if you've lost the moisture

893
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
in the stem

894
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,240
the buds are done the buds are done you

895
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,278
know what i mean like i just feel like i

896
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,038
feel like

897
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,119
you don't want a complete snap you don't

898
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,720
want the dust to fall when you hit the

899
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,558
uh when you when you when you go to bend

900
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
that snap i like some rigidity to that

901
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,440
stem

902
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,679
um i like to you know there's still a

903
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,679
little bit of a

904
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,798
but it it's just it bends under almost

905
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,120
its own pressure i feel like

906
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,200
what you what if you might

907
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,278
take it off the rack a little early you

908
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,960
can make up for that in the cure

909
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,440
the burp if you will um i i like to wait

910
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,038
until the outside of the buds are crispy

911
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,798
and you unfortunately you're gonna have

912
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,319
one of those buds i'm a hands-on kind of

913
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,079
guy there might be a science to it but

914
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,678
like i said i'm a hands-on kind of guy

915
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,359
and if you go to grab a bud there's

916
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,759
typically one bud more than others that

917
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,079
you might want to use but you go and you

918
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,558
just mush it and if that bud on the

919
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,558
outside is really crispy but

920
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,158
you can feel it it doesn't powder in

921
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,960
your hands first of all that's way too

922
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,559
dry that's that stem snapping or if you

923
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
you you crush it and it's still got a

924
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,319
little bit of bounce to it you know you

925
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,880
can feel that moisture in there as you

926
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,798
crush it it's like crush crush crush

927
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
crush all of a sudden bounce like a

928
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,720
sponge that's when i know it's done

929
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,640
there's a little bit of moisture left in

930
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,319
that bud that'll help me during the cure

931
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
and that'll help pull out some of those

932
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,798
those flavors and so on and so forth and

933
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,759
it won't it'll give me that that margin

934
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,679
of error during the curing process so i

935
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,679
completely go by the wayside of the the

936
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,360
snapping of the branch wait till you can

937
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,480
get a nice little crunch on the buds

938
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,319
with a little bit of moisture

939
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,240
and you're laughing and then after the

940
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,639
plants are dry you do the trimming

941
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,960
process trimming process is

942
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,880
it's extremely time consuming i mean i

943
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,558
remember it was like first time i ever

944
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,880
trimmed a plant i was like four plus

945
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,038
hours for this medium-sized plant you

946
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,799
know that just took up a a two foot by

947
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,440
two foot grow space it can be very

948
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,440
tedious now i know you can do a sloppy

949
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,278
job and maybe not get all of the leaves

950
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,278
off of there and speed up some things

951
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,079
and stuff like that but um do you have

952
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,878
any general tips overall for the

953
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,199
trimming process trimming sucks the

954
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,358
novelty of trimming wears off around the

955
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,158
second or third harvest like it's it's

956
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:18,799
ridiculous how you said it tedious it's

957
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,039
painful in a lot of cases your back gets

958
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
sore your fingers get sore hanging onto

959
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,878
the stems and you're like you can feel

960
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,159
it in your palm like it is it's it's

961
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,519
horrible it's horrible and i you know um

962
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,280
first thing you could do is just harvest

963
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,440
less plants that's number one you know

964
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
it's like do you really need this many

965
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,039
this is a big thing that i'm learning

966
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,079
i'm a perpetual gardener and i have had

967
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,480
a continuous garden going for

968
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,280
i don't know 10 plus years easily

969
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,440
and i have way too much way too much i'm

970
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,720
i i you know i it maybe it's a first

971
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,159
world problem but i'm throwing stuff

972
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,239
away left right and center because it's

973
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,240
either way too dry it's losing its color

974
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,759
it's been in the drawer forever it's

975
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,679
just it's no good you know even the

976
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,000
goats would need it so

977
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,279
you know ask yourself how many plants

978
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,559
you really need to harvest that's that

979
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
that would be the biggest question

980
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,119
because if you can get away with two

981
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,159
instead of four do the two that's number

982
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,599
one number two uh yeah i definitely get

983
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,838
sloppier you know when you first start

984

harvesting the the plants you're you're

985
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,679
trimming are just

986
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,200
you got so tight to the bud you're

987
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,199
showing them off to your buddies you're

988
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,279
excited and those are the best trimmed

989
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,960
buds you've ever seen in your life by

990
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,880

993
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,719
worry about it no i'm not even trimming

994
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,039
that one that was good so it's like it

995
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,919
you kind of get a little bit looser but

996
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,880
to

997
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,159
to to really maximize your your uh your

998
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,440
trimming time

999
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:48,000
make it fun um i i believe in trim

1000
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,639

them happy and make the best of it um i

1009
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,720
prefer to stand rather than sit because

1010
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,759
i find standing just allows me to like

1011
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,919
get a little bit loose and and and trim

1012
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,480
um you know sitting over such a long

1013
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,760
time can be a real pain in the ass a

1014
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,559
good set of trimmers goes a long way and

1015
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,320
i and and i mean that because uh you

1016
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,199
know if uh

1017
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,280
having to do this you know for four plus

1018
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,118
hours is is a lot and if you don't have

1019
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
a set of trimmers that auto opens you

1020
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,559
know you don't want to use scissors

1021
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
where you have to do both directions you

1022
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,480
know you want to have a spring in there

1023
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,439
um some people some people swear by

1024
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,358
fiskus i personally just use whatever

1025
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,039
ones that i can find at my local

1026
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,199
hardware store for a fraction of the

1027
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,119
price um just something that's going to

1028
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,719
work with you you need a long pair and a

1029
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,880
small pair

1030
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,719
and yeah go ham make it fun that's my

1031
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,280
best advice i know a lot of people use

1032
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,519
the trim trays as well i'm not sure if

1033
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,680
you use those or not but that actually

1034
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,679
helps with the dry sift you know because

1035
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,919
they have that screen and then as that

1036
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,519
trims running across it

1037
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,720
the trichomes are falling down onto that

1038
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,320
bottom part and you can actually scrape

1039
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,519
that up and use that so have you used

1040
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,599
any of the trim trays or no no no i

1041
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,480
haven't and i haven't used a bowl or

1042
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,119
anything

1043
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,519
um i i will i have like i use an

1044
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,119
electric trimmer um those things for

1045
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,358
doing big colas are great um very speedy

1046
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,160
very fast or speedy and fast the same

1047
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,559
thing but very efficient

1048
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,159
cost wise oh you got to be careful which

1049
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,920
ones you get because you can break bank

1050
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,399
for some of these electric trimmers that

1051
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,838
not necessary in terms of the price but

1052
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,079
definitely and that's the downside of

1053
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,000
using one of these screens that i used

1054
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,920
was that uh there goes an electric

1055
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,599
trimmer these buds are not as big as my

1056
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,280
forearm you know they're they're a lot

1057
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,880
smaller which made it

1058
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
a little more tedious a little more time

1059
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,440
consuming but i've been wanting to try

1060
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
those bowl trimmers i heard a lot about

1061
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,039
them i think ac infinity just dropped

1062
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
one of them actually two different sizes

1063
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,880
i believe i think there's like a 16 and

1064
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,559
a 19 inch or something like that and uh

1065
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,960
seems to make it much faster of a

1066
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,719
process i just worry and which i think a

1067
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,800
lot of people worry about is the quality

1068
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,239
of the product that you get out of it so

1069
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
interested no in the comments section

1070
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,759
has anybody used any of those trim

1071
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,920
machines or or bowl trimmers or anything

1072
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,440
like that let us know let us know your

1073
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
experience on it and if it's worth

1074
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,838
picking up and using or not sweet so

1075
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,679
let's get into curing next so uh

1076
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,279
definitely an important process you can

1077
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,000
get through your grow you get through

1078
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,880
the

1079
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,639
the harvest dry the bud washing all that

1080
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,320
stuff get to the curing you could

1081
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,838
completely mess it up right and throw it

1082
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,640
away because you got mold appearing on

1083
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,119
there so very very important process uh

1084
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,879
is the home stretch there tell us how do

1085
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,599
you go about curing

1086
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,079
you said it it's so important you know

1087
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,559
um that's also one of those learning

1088
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,560
learning uh experience things that

1089
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,719
you'll only get better with over time

1090
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,320
and through harvests i've had to do it

1091
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,159
right a few times and i've had to do it

1092
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,480
wrong a few times to really understand

1093
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,078
what the what your margin of error is

1094
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,358
when it comes to

1095
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,839
curing you know

1096
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,719
i do say that you can take it off the

1097
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,000
the

1098
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,639
um the dry rack a little quicker and

1099
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,679
have some play time in the cure

1100
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,920
um

1101
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,519
in terms of or trying to draw out that

1102
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,519
dry

1103
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,679
but if the more moist that you put those

1104
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,679
buds in the jar if that makes any sense

1105
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,838
the the more likely are you are to get

1106
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,399
mold

1107
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,920
and if if you are trying to put them in

1108
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,000
a jar sooner

1109
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,680
you know you've got to be very vigilant

1110
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,760
in terms of trying to avoid that buildup

1111
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,118
of moisture in your jars

1112
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,440
i much rather through experience

1113
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,119
over dry my my bud and put it in the jar

1114
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,679
then then have it

1115
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,160
more moist and put it in the jar if that

1116
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,279
makes any sense um

1117
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:58,000
i i often find that when i think i've

1118
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,800
over dried my product when i put it in

1119
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,880
the jar and give it a good 24 hours the

1120
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,480
moisture is bad it's not back it's there

1121
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,240
it's there it was never really gone it's

1122
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,000
there and and you know you touch those

1123
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,679
buds it's like oh oh they are kind of

1124
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,760
sticking to each other in the in the jar

1125
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,559
still you know that's good that's good

1126
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,920
so

1127
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,519
um generally speaking i use about i

1128
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,400
think i should go bigger because my

1129
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:24,239
harvests are typically a pound or larger

1130
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,639
um but i should be using like vaults

1131
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,399
in terms of those c vaults but i'm using

1132
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,358
um the glass

1133
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,440
kind of mason jars but one quart i've

1134
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,880
been using those faithfully

1135
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
fill those like a chip bag three

1136
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,200
quarters of the way full seal it off

1137
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,720
right on it put it in a cold or cool

1138
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,719
dark area

1139
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,318
in the basement um

1140
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,719
typically in the exact same temperature

1141
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,318
that i it was drying in you know there's

1142
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,559
not much different there trying to keep

1143
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:56,000
it in around that 60 62 percent is ideal

1144
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,239
but again you're playing the plus minus

1145
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,480
game any hydrometers that you use are

1146
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,479
typically plus minus in their own right

1147
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,760
so it's so tough to get that perfect

1148
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,199
amount um i don't use

1149
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,880
packs um like i.e bavita um mainly

1150
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,480
because i feel like it takes a lot of my

1151
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,599
vigilance out of the game like out of

1152
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,599
the

1153
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,359
uh

1154
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,119
it takes my diligence

1155
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,679
out of the out of the equation and i

1156
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,640
feel like when you get this far

1157
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,199
don't trust on a humidity pack to get

1158
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,799
you through the burping phase okay i'm

1159
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,399
not talking about a long-term storage

1160
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,720
here i'm talking about those first

1161
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,400
couple weeks after your harvest i don't

1162
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
believe a bavita pack is is going to do

1163
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,760
you any justice you're pushing 90

1164
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,079
humidity in those jars sometimes

1165
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,160
immediately after harvest that that

1166
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,400
bavita packs just being inundated with

1167
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,838
moisture it's not working i feel like

1168
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,440
you want to

1169
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,400
you know keep an eye as soon as you

1170
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,240
harvest put them in the jars every 24

1171
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,720
hours you're going to be burping

1172
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,799
typically for about a week give or take

1173
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,719
and these you can't take take any of

1174
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
this for for just

1175
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,439
you got to take it with a grain of salt

1176
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
because every environment's a little bit

1177
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,519
different but typically within the first

1178
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,680
week i'm burping every day after that

1179
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,280
it's typically every few days two or

1180
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,199
three days just based on how much

1181
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,560
moisture is being retained and then

1182
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,399
after two three weeks four weeks it's

1183
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,279
pretty well good for about once every

1184
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,160
month to to be burped it's not unusual

1185
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
to be

1186
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:26,078
sitting in a jar for six eight ten

1187
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,000
fifteen months so long term storage i do

1188
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,079
believe in a bavita pack i do believe in

1189
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,838
those moisture packs because they will

1190
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,240
maintain that moisture in there for a

1191
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,519
long term period i p i think people

1192
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,598
often believe that if you just throw a

1193
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,679
moisture packer pack in there it's gonna

1194
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,000
take that 90 humidity and just bring it

1195
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,279
down to 60 percent or if you've got 30

1196
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,760
percent it's just going to bring it up

1197
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,760
to 60 and that's

1198
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,920
just the wrong wrong methodology for

1199
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,319
those things we have a lot of newbies

1200
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
watching this one here and uh you

1201
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,599
definitely covered a lot of it in detail

1202
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,679
container using temperature humidity

1203
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,680
burping break down the details what

1204
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,759
exactly how do you burp the jars it

1205
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,598
comes down to where you are like how

1206
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
long you let them dry out you know if

1207
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,400
you've got

1208
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,838
an incredible amount of moisture in

1209
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,838
there you know you're there's a build up

1210
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:15,279
of co2 there's a build up of moisture

1211
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,838
there's a buildup of of of of of just

1212
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,400
undesirable gases inside that jar as

1213
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,719
it's trying to do its job

1214
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,639
and it needs to be expelled if you've

1215
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,318
got way too much moisture in there so

1216
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,400
you're pushing 90 plus and that's not

1217
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:30,000
unusual that's not unusual you need to

1218
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,720
actually get those buds out of there i

1219
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,039
in my opinion if you fill this jar up

1220
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,559
three quarters of the way full and and

1221
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,759
you start to look at the jar after a 24

1222
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,759
hour period

1223
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,599
those buds are stuck to each other you

1224
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,960
you can i can shake the jar and i can

1225
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,119
try to get those buds out of there but

1226
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,318
they're stuck to each other so in order

1227
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,358
to get them out and un fr and unstock to

1228
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,679
free them you got to get them out of the

1229
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,239
jar and i like to sometimes put them out

1230
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,639
over top of like a pan or something or a

1231
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,039
desk or a table or something clean and

1232
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,519
just let them sit for about half hour 45

1233
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,358
minutes until again the outsides of

1234
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,119
those buds are similar to the work they

1235
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,119
were when you you took them off the dry

1236
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,559
rack they're crunchy on the outside

1237
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,480
moist on the inside

1238
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,159
sounds like a great candy commercial but

1239
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,599
it's it's you're going to crush it you

1240
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,879
know one of those buds unfortunately

1241
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,000
isn't going to be survive is it going to

1242
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,680
survive because it's going to be your

1243
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,280
tester and you're going to just molest

1244
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,879
it unfortunately and then you're going

1245
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,119
to know you're going to know okay it's

1246
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,358
ready to go back in the jar for another

1247
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,280
12 24 hours where are you are you at the

1248
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,880
beginning of the burp

1249
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,200
if if so you're probably going to come

1250
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,599
back in 12 hours best way to check on

1251
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,838
your your your jar without actually

1252
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,519
opening it was what i said there kind of

1253
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,960
kind of shake it a little bit and if

1254
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,800
those buds are kind of tumbling in there

1255
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,720
on their own they're probably good for

1256
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,280
like another you know

1257
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,480
12 hours and then do it again you don't

1258
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,400
have to go in there so often if the

1259
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,639
moisture level isn't so high some people

1260
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,720
use hydrometers but again it's it's plus

1261
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,639
minus those things are plus minus i do i

1262
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:58,159
do recommend using hydrometer it's just

1263
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:00,078
don't rely on it it's it i i i i kind of

1264
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,239
compare it to the analogy of being lost

1265
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,519
in the woods with a gun

1266
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,879
someone who's lost in the winds with a

1267
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,239
gun is far less likely to survive than

1268
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,519
somebody who gets lost in the woods

1269
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,919
without a gun and that's because as a

1270
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,318
we tend to become too competent in our

1271
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,519
tools and we think that the gun what's

1272
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,358
the gun going to do the gun can't get

1273
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,519
water for you the gun can't get you know

1274
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,639
it can't bring wildlife to you it you

1275
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,719
know

1276
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,118
it it's it's a tool and so if you rely

1277
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,559
on these tools a i.e these boveda packs

1278
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,960
or sorry i don't want to throw boveda

1279
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,078
under the bus here these hydro packs and

1280
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,838
these these hydrometers then you you're

1281
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,119
you're you you can be i'm not saying

1282
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,078
everyone but you can be less likely to

1283
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,838
be more diligent and so just don't rely

1284
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,839
on it so heavily a lot a lot of this can

1285
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,599
be figured out by feel and by sight

1286
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,838
that's all i'm trying to say i use those

1287
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,400
little mini hygrometers

1288
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,400
it has the not only the humidity but

1289
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,960
also the temperature as well

1290
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,039
and uh i fell into the chapter relying

1291
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,800
on those 100 and a lot of people do rely

1292
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,719
on 100

1293
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,640
they can be accurate but the ones that i

1294
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,959
was using unfortunately i had a couple

1295
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,000
that were inaccurate and uh although it

1296
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,880
said it was 62 rh which a lot of people

1297
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,519
deem as the ideal percent unfortunately

1298
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,039
mold appeared on the buds and i lost two

1299
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,719
jars because it said 62 but actually

1300
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,119
looking at the jars they were actually a

1301
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,759
white fuzz like actual mold it was

1302
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,599
pretty gross and so i threw those things

1303
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,359
out because those ones weren't accurate

1304
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,640
but no you bring up a great point is

1305
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,639
like you might want to actually have

1306
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,719
like another

1307
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,000
measurement to kind of compare it to to

1308
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,598
make sure that there's accurate don't

1309
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,838
just trust it right out of the box that

1310
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,440
it's going to be accurate test it first

1311
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,279
to make sure because

1312
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,599
you could spoil your harvest from it you

1313
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,519
know and and just because it's accurate

1314
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,039
on in june

1315
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,358
doesn't mean it's going to be accurate

1316
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,960
in august or may of the next year you

1317
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,000
know and and that's just that's

1318
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,920
something that you just need to take

1319
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,119
into consideration you know there's

1320
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,880
there's other methods you said there's

1321
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,838
other methods use them and just because

1322
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,880
it says 62 in the jar

1323
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,519
that doesn't mean that it's not 75

1324
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,920
between two buds in this little tiny

1325
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,440
corner that's why i like to rotate the

1326
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,519
jar get the buds to kind of tumble

1327
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,358
inside move them about if i notice that

1328
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:16,960
kind of two buds are stuck together

1329
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,199
that's a great indicator that i need to

1330
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,720
get in there and kind of just

1331
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,558
get them unstuck

1332
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,199
and and so yeah just be vigilant

1333
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,079
vigilant is key for being if for curing

1334
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,399
burping and drying and when are the buds

1335
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,720
ready to consume

1336
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,720
see that's the key is i also say that

1337
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,279
you need product

1338
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,039
to harvest product this is the thing and

1339
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,119
i'd say it's so much better if i could

1340
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,440
but the thing is is that it's like you

1341
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,720
can't get to the end if you don't have

1342
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,760
something to ingest yourself okay so

1343
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:52,239
it's it it's it's very tough

1344
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,720
to to sit there and watch this beautiful

1345
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,879
plant just staring at you and and you

1346
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,639
just want to eat

1347
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,800
but you don't have anything right you

1348
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,719
won't let it get there so the thing is

1349
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,039
is you need to be in a good state to get

1350
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,719
to a good harvest so when's a good time

1351
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,199
to ingest it well when you need it

1352
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,598
that's my first thing so once it's once

1353
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,519
it's if you got through a dry period and

1354
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,800
you got through a burp and you got you

1355
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,759
got a cure of really any sorts

1356
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,280
it

1357
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,960
dive in don't go hungry with a fridge

1358
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,559
full of food that's that's the first

1359
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,838
thing i would say the second thing i

1360
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,599
would say is that if you've if you've

1361
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,440
got something to ingest while it is

1362
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,720
doing its thing and you're okay you're

1363
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,240
comfortable

1364
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,598
two weeks

1365
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,358
minimum

1366
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,640
minimum and i think you're doing

1367
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,960
yourself an injustice if you're going to

1368
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:37,838
do it after two weeks if if two weeks

1369
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
minimum

1370
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,358
a cure

1371
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,358
you can ingest it personally though if

1372
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:46,318
you can wait a month

1373
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,239
a month in the cure that that if you had

1374
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,639
ingested it on two weeks versus the

1375
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,199
month it's a world of difference i i

1376
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,000
once read and and i live on bro science

1377
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,439
i've got a third degree black bow uh the

1378
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,880
uh the

1379
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,720
i i believe that if with a proper cure

1380
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,800
you can pull out the remaining

1381
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,199
potential of that bud now everyone says

1382
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,880
yeah of course curing does that but i

1383
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,799
but i think a good cure a good cure goes

1384
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,800
like a long way i think if you were to

1385
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,200
put it on a scale and say like all your

1386
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,440
efforts and work in the flower is going

1387
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,519
to do this much to its it's it's smoke

1388
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,679
ability you know the work you do in the

1389
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,159
flower stage is going to do this much

1390
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,159
compared to its smoke ability the the

1391
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,960
amount you it does to in the first two

1392
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:36,879
weeks of cure does this much to its

1393
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,280
smoke ability but giving it a month

1394
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,200
i think does that to its smoke ability

1395
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,440
you know what i mean like that's so i'm

1396
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,239
two weeks minimum but a month cure and

1397
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,599
you're laughing you're laughing i agree

1398
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,799
with that you know two weeks of the

1399
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,318
minimum is when i'll touch it but i

1400
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,480
usually have a stockpile kind of like

1401
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,920
use so 30 days is really when i'm

1402
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,480
testing it out for myself and that's uh

1403
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,480
you know it's two weeks in it you taste

1404
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,679
the the greenness or a lot of people say

1405
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,000
chlorophyll

1406
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,399
um and then after a month or so like

1407
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
sometimes you can still taste it but

1408
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,480
most of the time that that's gone so i

1409
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,358
really feel like 30 days at the minimum

1410
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,838
is usually when i'm testing it out and

1411
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,838
get a much better flavor than two weeks

1412
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,519
in you know so

1413
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,480
yep so like i mentioned earlier there's

1414
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,000
a lot of new folks listening in here i'm

1415
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,440
sure there's a large handful of people

1416
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,760
who haven't even gone through their

1417
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,838
first harvest yet what other advice do

1418
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,319
you have for somebody who is new to

1419
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:35,519
these processes uh see again i'm not a

1420
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,960
science guy i'm kind of a life guy

1421
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,480
you need to make this system work for

1422
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,318
you you need to make your harvest work

1423
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,920
for you if you are new to it

1424
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,519
um you know

1425
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,318
you don't have to go overboard you don't

1426
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,318
have to buy the 200 trimmers you don't

1427
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:51,759
have to buy all the equipment you don't

1428
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,119
need fancy

1429
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,400
i don't want to throw any brands under

1430
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,318
the bus here when i do this but it's

1431
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,720
like you don't need any fancy curing

1432
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,880
things you don't need any you can keep

1433
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:02,399
this really simple and i think that's

1434
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,720
the key i think that's the key because

1435
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,599
this is your first time and a lot can go

1436
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,118
wrong and i'm not trying to scare anyone

1437
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,720
but when i when i was given my little

1438
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,280
scale there the same thing can go

1439
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,239
towards the like the

1440
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,559
the amount of risk that's involved you

1441
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,799
know and the later you get into the

1442
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,200
process of harvesting the more risk is

1443
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,039
involved in in things going wrong and

1444
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,960
and all it takes is just a less of a

1445
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:31,440
mistake and and things like you know um

1446
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,358
over over simplifying or or over

1447
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,599
complicating the process is one of those

1448
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,358
things where it's like you you feel like

1449
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,160
you need all the best things you need

1450
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,679
the best um uh jars you need and and

1451
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,879
that's not true that's not true that's

1452
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,440
not true this is

1453
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,480
it we do put a lot of weight on getting

1454
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,318
it right

1455
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,318
but there's a lot more ways to get it

1456
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,599
right than there are to get it wrong

1457
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,480
it's just the ways to get it wrong are

1458
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,480
really easy you know it's not hard

1459
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,119
but but anyways anyways as i contradict

1460
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,358
myself the idea would be to make it fun

1461
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,599
make it comfortable and make it work for

1462
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,838
you you know incorporate people that you

1463
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,599
trust and you love into the process i

1464
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,679
think that's number one i think that'll

1465
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,440
help make the process go a lot longer a

1466
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,358
lot easier

1467
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,358
because you can talk to somebody you can

1468
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:16,799
you can enjoy the process with somebody

1469
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,358
and it's it's just that much more

1470
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,200
enjoyable um standing as i said like

1471
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,920
when you when you harvest

1472
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,439
standing and not sitting is huge

1473
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,800
getting the right pair of trimmers for

1474
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,960
you is huge

1475
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,200
