products on the market today in this

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,099
video I'll talk a little bit about the

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,840
ion frame LED grow light while I

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,179
unboxing it so you can learn more about

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,980
it and see what comes in the Box I do

20
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,738
have a discount code for this grow light

21
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,199
code Mr Gold 15 it actually works for

22
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,000
all AC Infinity grow lights and all of

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,920
their products in their Hydroponics and

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,899
grow as category as well as the grow

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
accessories category upon opening the

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,960
box I noticed that they put some

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,960
information on the inside flap

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,859
first thing out the box is the driver

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,019
this driver can be mounted on the

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,060
fixture or can be kept off the fixture

31
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,739
and kept outside of your grow space for

32
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,900
example pulling out the grow light from

33
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,798
the box and then opening up this smaller

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,939
box inside this box is a uis M2M 10 foot

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
cord uis MTM two foot cord stainless

36
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,500
steel wire hangers

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,320
a wire tie set hook and loop ties

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,780
various screws for mounting and some

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,219
rope ratchet hangers here is the driver

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,140
extension cord

41
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,578
these are the driver brackets in case

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,680
you want to mount the driver to the

43
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,539
fixture here's the schedule controller

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,540
where you can set daily light schedules

45
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,759
and even simulate sunrise and sunset and

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,680
lastly they include a user manual and an

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,478
intro to Growing book the first thing I

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,340
noticed when handling the light is that

49
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,019
it is extremely light the frame is

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,600
actually magnetic so you can pair the

51
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,340
ion frame with the ion beam light bars

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,399
if you choose to provide supplemental

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,520
full spectrum or UV light the unit pulls

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,519
280 Watts from the wall at 100 the

55
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,560
diodes on this fixture are Samsung

56
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,019
lm301h Evo diodes this is Samsung's

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,000
latest diode and is a top of the line in

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,280
Horticultural lighting these diodes are

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,159
very efficient and algorithmically

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,900
placed on a bar style fixture to admit a

61
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,318
uniform full spectrum of light

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,140
efficiency comes in at 3.14 micromoles

63
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,458
per Joule wow in the user manual they

64
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,439
show you how to hang the fixture

65
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,479
although I personally like to do it a

66
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,759
little bit differently I use two light

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,560
ratchet hangers only simply Loop each

68
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,139
light ratchet hanger over the top of the

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,479
grow tent bar then connect each end to

70
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,339
the grow light as I'm doing here this

71
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,619
makes it so much easier to move the

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,420
light up and down by simply holding onto

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,180
one side of the fixture while pulling

74
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,399
the Rope it is part of the uis platform

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,760
so you can connect it to a controller 69

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,060
or controller 69 Pro I'm using the uis

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,159
mtam cord which is 10 feet long to

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,039
connect from the driver to my controller

79
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,159
69 Pro I then go to the AC Infinity app

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,079
tap on the controller in my 2x4 for Port

81
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,659
2 which is the port that the light is

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,640
connected to I'm changing it from off to

83
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,979
schedule I'm then setting the start time

84
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,719
for when the light should turn on then

85
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,419
setting the stop time for when the light

86
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,459
should turn off easy also to set the

87
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,699
dimmer percent I'm going from schedule

88
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,400
to on the setting of six shown here is

89
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,759
60 I'm going to change it to 5 for now

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,739
which is 50 lastly I'm going back to

91
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,079
schedule so that the light will turn on

92
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,700
and off according to what I've said AC

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
Infinity recommends hanging this grow

94
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,899
light at least one foot above your

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,539
plants and to set your percentage to 40

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,700
for the seedling stage 80 for the

97
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,318
vegetative stage and 100 of the

98
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,119
flowering stage the height will vary

99
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,859
based on the plant you're growing they

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,259
show the coverage area for all of the

101
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,760
LED grow lights in their Evo Series in

102
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,798
their user manual like I mentioned

103
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,719
earlier I have the EVO 3 which has a

104
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,400
flowering coverage area of two feet by

105
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,939
four feet but they have other grow

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,879
lights for larger spaces such as 3x3 4x4

107
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,439
