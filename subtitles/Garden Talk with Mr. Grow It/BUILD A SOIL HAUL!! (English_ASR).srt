00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
farms t-shirt

100
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:20,318
normal price on this is 25 i got it for

101
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
dollars and 50 cents i did stumble

102
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,958
across a

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,479
five percent discount code so i saved

104
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,920
eight dollars and fifteen cents

105
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,359
that brings the subtotal to 154.95

106
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,280
they offered free shipping for some of

107
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,239
the items but not all the items

108
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,680
so i did pay 10.56 for shipping that

109
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
brings the grand total to 165.51

110
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
adding up all the normal prices that i

111
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,199
mentioned with shipping

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
without the savings without the discount

113
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,079
code ended up being

114
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,840
229 229.56 so my total savings was

115
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,319
64.5 cents not too bad of a savings

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,239
