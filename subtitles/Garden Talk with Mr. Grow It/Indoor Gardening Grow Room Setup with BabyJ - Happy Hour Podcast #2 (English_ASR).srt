21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
she got into growing and then we talk

22
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,960

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,359
friend

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,118
he uh he decided to give me a plant as

56
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,599
before a present instead of you know

57
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,200
a normal present so um he was just

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,839
telling me he was like well

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
uh just go ahead go ahead and check out

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
youtube and it'll teach you everything

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
you need to know about growing this

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,478
plant

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
so i didn't know anything about the

64
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,399
youtube world i didn't even know anybody

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
was putting videos out about growing um

66
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
this was back in the back in the day

67
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,199
when mr tight and

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
angry closet first started his channel

69
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,959
and um

70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
crazy it was crazy how much youtube has

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
progressed since then but um i got on

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
youtube

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
and i started watching all the videos

74
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,159
about people uh growing

75
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,159
there was so many different ways so many

76
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,719
different uh techniques

77
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,439
out there to uh to teach you how to grow

78
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,318
so

79
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,239
um i spent hours and hours and hours

80
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,280
every day watching youtube you guys like

81
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
literally

82
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
um i watched youtube more than i watched

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
my own television so

84
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
um literally watch it for about a few

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,239
months before i actually got comfortable

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
with actually posting videos because i

87
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,039
was watching it and i still had the plan

88
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
growing but i wasn't really too

89
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,679
comfortable posting because i really

90
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
didn't want people to

91
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
uh i don't know i didn't really want to

92
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
look like i didn't really know what i

93
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,079
was talking about

94
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
before i started making videos like you

95
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
know you know you have that fear of yeah

96
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
i don't i don't want to look stupid on

97
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
camera or whatever the case may be so

98
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,399
it took me a little while actually to

99
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,238
post content on my channel

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
but um i was actually growing you know a

101
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
few months prior to that

102
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,199
my first girl actually didn't really

103
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
turn out too well

104
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,039
as you may know yeah that's pretty much

105
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
how i got started literally

106
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,400
where'd you go for inspiration like who

107
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080

113

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,239
guide was the guy

116
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,759
because he was pretty much doing the

117
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
same setup that i had like he was the

118
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,798
only grower that i seen

119
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,879
um because i started off with cfls so

120
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
um i was looking in the closet or

121
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,239
something yeah i was it was like

122
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,518
it was actually a little closet box

123
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,878
because um

124
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
you know the little plastic totes i

125
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,840
don't know if you guys watch love vibes

126
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,199
i don't know mr growth if you checked

127
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,759
out love life's channel

128
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
but um he in the beginning he started

129
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,318
off with these little

130
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
grow boxes you know you buy the little

131
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,518
plastic totes and you know you make a

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,438
little mini robots and

133
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,799
with cfls and i and like i said back in

134
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,158
the day i was started with cfl so i

135
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
watched a lot of videos that were

136
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,120
pertaining towards cfl

137
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
so go for 20 guy had an awesome cfo grow

138
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
um on his channel that i was watching

139
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,759
all the time and then uh

140
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,000
love vibes i got the little grow box

141
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,239
idea from love vibes and i had me i made

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
a few little grow boxes um you know to

143
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,319
start off with or whatever the case may

144
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,519
be but

145
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,000
um i would say early inspirations

146
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,519
grow 420 guide was really the main one

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
because he was actually growing in the

148
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,198
same type of setup that

149
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
i you know kind of sort of had is he

150
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,879
still active

151
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,240
um i haven't seen videos from him in in

152
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,719
quite a while

153
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,400
um but even even still now he has a

154
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
wealth of information on his channel

155
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,399
so you can go back you know videos and

156
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
videos back and you're still going to

157
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,359
find just a wealth of

158
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
you know content do you want to ask her

159
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
a couple more questions about her first

160
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
girl

161
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,000
yeah yeah let's get into the first goal

162
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
let's get into the the nitty-gritty of

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
the first girl you said it was bad i

164
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,160
want to hear about that

165
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,319
it was okay because okay you guys don't

166
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,439
laugh don't laugh this is me too

167
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,959
you you know newbie mistakes but i

168
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,478
okay when i first started growing like i

169
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,159
said i got the plant from my friend

170
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,079
and he told me to you know you look on

171
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
youtube and in blase blase blah now i

172
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,800
didn't know that

173
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,119
you know you would need nutrients for

174
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,478
the plants so you know i was under an

175
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,918
impression that you just get dirt you

176
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,439
know you feed the water and you know

177
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,680
like any noob would you know think

178
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,478
you know water dirt and it should grow

179
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
um

180
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,038
you know i got some miracle-gro soil and

181
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
everything was going good

182
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,680
you know the plant was go it was growing

183
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,120
you know miracle grow has you know a

184
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,959
little bit of substance in it now that i

185
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,478
you know i know really more about it so

186
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,399
it kept the plant going for a little bit

187
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,839
but when the plant actually needed

188
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,879
nutrients and started actually showing

189
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,719
deficiencies

190
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
you know i started to panic so of course

191
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
you know you know

192
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,478
second nature oh let me go on youtube

193
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
and figure out what what the problem is

194
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,800
or let me go check out let me go see

195
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,639
what the problem is

196
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,759
and you know i found out that i needed

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
to supplement with nutrients so i

198
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,400
ordered my first uh nutrient

199
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,720
supplement which was the general

200
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,560
hydroponics floor series you know on the

201
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,080
back of the the bottle it says

202
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,038
you know mix per gallon ratio now i'm so

203
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,639
impatient because

204
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,240
as a new grower if you're really into

205
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
the if you're really into growing

206
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,038
cannabis

207
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
you're literally and you're i'm in there

208
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,079
all the time looking at the plants i'm

209
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,759
you know they're not even doing anything

210
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,359
and i'm just staring at them hoping that

211
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,000
i can see a difference in them

212
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,439
so um you know i got my general

213
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
hydroponics and it said on the back of

214
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,719
the bottle mix per gallon

215
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
but i was so impatient thinking that if

216
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
i feed them

217
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,359
you know i had a little uh water bottle

218
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,360
just a little eight ounce water bottle

219
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
and i swear i mixed up a gallons worth

220
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,319
of nutrients in that little eight ounce

221
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
bottle

222
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,879
of nutrients and fed it to my plant and

223
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,240
must have fried the whole

224
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,639
crap out of my plants y'all like

225
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
yeah so that was it that was the end of

226
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,478
that story

227
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
i mean yeah because after that it really

228
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,120
i think i actually pushed it to go mail

229
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,719
honestly because it started

230
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
throwing ball sacks like crazy it could

231
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,759
have just been a male but

232
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,360
you know that you know i fried it

233
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
seriously bad and it turned out to be a

234
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
male so i had to get rid of him so i was

235
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,160
kind of down about that too so

236
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,199
well i'm sure uh i haven't seen your

237
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
youtube channel but i'm sure you've

238
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
figured it out since then if you have a

239
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
youtube channel

240
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,280
oh yeah of course of course of course

241
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,800
i'm telling you though

242
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,638
and those mistakes it's so funny because

243
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
a lot of new growers they make that

244
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,319
type of mistake all the time it's you

245
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,839
know

246
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,120
you you think that if you feed it more

247
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,519
you're going to get more results and

248
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
that's

249
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,639
never ever the case that's why

250
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
less is really more and a lot of growers

251
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,038
can tell you that themselves

252
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,598
let's get into the current grow so your

253
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,680
setup

254
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,279
is has expanded quite a bit i know you

255
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
have like a multiple tent set up now

256
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,159
stuff like that so let's talk about

257
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
tell us about your current growth setup

258
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
that you have go on all right so right

259
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,079
now

260
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
in the main fly room i have a spectrum

261
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,598
king

262
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,079
and two march hydro 600 watts

263
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,319
all led lights or yeah those are all led

264
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,680
right now currently i'm using majority

265
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
all led i haven't

266
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,079
experimented with any you know intent

267
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,759
you know hids or anything like that yet

268
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,038
honestly you know a lot of heating

269
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
issues i'm still trying to dial my

270
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,680
temperature and everything in

271
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
because even with the leds i'm still

272
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
experiencing you know

273
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,719
the spike in intent temperature um but

274
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
um

275
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
yeah i have all leds i have in the

276
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
bedroom i have my t5

277
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
it's a 240 watt t5 as well as i'm still

278
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,719
using some supplemental cfl

279
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
lighting as well for veg and then i have

280
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
uh

281
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,439
and that's all in the tent though i have

282
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,680
the cfl's in the tent and then

283
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,120
um my mars hydro 310 as well and then um

284
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,959
i have a breeding tent that's actually

285
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
using the my grow leds

286
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,038
i don't know if you guys heard about

287
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,839
micro led but a nice little 100 watt

288
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,080
unit

289
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
perfect for breeding perfect for you

290
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
know a small little two by four grow

291
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,958
especially because i have two of them

292
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
and you're making you're making your own

293
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,319
strains then

294
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,399
um yeah well i'm experimenting with a

295
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
little breeding uh nothing too serious

296
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
because you know i

297
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
uh i don't know i don't know how to say

298
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
because you know how like

299
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,838
people get so uptight about being you

300
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,879
know pollen chucking and whatever the

301
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
case may be

302
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,720
um a little bit what's pollen chuckin

303
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,639
apparently it's just when you just throw

304
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
whatever you can together

305
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,240
it's not really called you know true

306
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
breeding i guess gotcha

307
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,639
it's like a smorgasbord of pollen it's

308
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
not like a true just one-to-one

309
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,679
yeah you know and it's a lot of

310
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
controversy behind that you know like a

311
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,919
lot of breeders can tell you so

312
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
yeah gotcha and so like when you you

313
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,559
said you're having heat problems when

314
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
you like walk into your room do you have

315
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,119
all of these tents in one like bedroom

316
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,639
or

317
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,159
is it do you have an air conditioner in

318
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,879
there are they spread out

319
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,319
throughout or yeah so the way my room is

320
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,278
set up it's it's actually

321
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,720
pretty you you probably wouldn't even

322
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,720
think it would be like this but

323
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,920
i have where i have the main fly room

324
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,759
it's a huge

325
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,838
i'm talking about huge walk-in closet

326
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,439
like it's they're pretty much a whole

327
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,519
nother room in itself

328
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
then um that's the main flower room then

329
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
you come out so can you get

330
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,480
can you get air conditioning in there or

331
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,159
anything or like how do you i have a i

332
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,839
have air conditioning in my main

333
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,439
in my main room which is actually it's

334
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,640
like it's like in the dead center so

335
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
it's kind of like the epicenter

336
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
of my whole setup so i have an ac in the

337
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,399
main room

338
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,000
which actually you know supplies the

339
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,759
actual basement where the bedroom is as

340
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
well as the main fly room

341
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,720
but the only problem i'm having is

342
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
because i think i need to get a higher

343
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
btu

344
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
ac because it's not really i you know it

345
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,120
has that little it's like a 5000 btu but

346
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,640
it has to cover

347
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,959
you know the basement as well as the

348
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,000
flower room so it's kind of

349
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,479
it's not it's not enough yeah no five

350
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
thousand

351
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,759
i mean they get like a normal window

352
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
unit is usually like 10 000 b2 right

353
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,278
does anyone know yeah and i have a

354
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,039
smaller unit now and i've been meaning

355
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,159
to upgrade the uh the ac unit i was

356
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,799
actually thinking about going 10

357
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,958
10 000 btus using up because this one is

358
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,039
the window unit or

359
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,559
yeah it's a window unit got you because

360
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,159
i know some people use the standing air

361
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,319
conditioners and

362
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,600
i i don't know i've heard mixed reviews

363
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,519
about them like i know

364
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
there's two different versions one

365
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,639
version actually releases

366
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
smelly air through the exhaust

367
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,799
and then there's another version that

368
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,360
actually pulls air from the outside and

369
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,159
then

370
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,519
uses that and then sends that same air

371
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,879
out so it like doesn't

372
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,560
release uh smelly air of course of

373
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,078
course those ones

374
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,679
i would be able to get with some one of

375
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,958
those but you know

376
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,559
pocketed funds and everything like that

377
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,599
those are like super expensive yeah

378
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,838
those are more expensive

379
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
and i don't know if they're even better

380
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
i was just saying i've just heard of

381
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,759
them i don't know if they're better at

382
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
all i know window units are pretty

383
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,078
reliable and

384
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
yeah they're pretty reliable and the

385
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,399
thing about it is too because i have

386
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,159
central i have central

387
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
you know air conditioner in the house so

388
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,679
i have it's like i have that going as

389
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
well as the window unit just trying to

390
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,679
combat to kind of

391
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,719
even it out because right now since it's

392
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,639
so hot right now

393
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
and i'm in california you know my flower

394
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,278
room is getting with all the leds on and

395
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,959
everything

396
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,200
um 82 80 to 86 that's like the highest

397
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,879
that yeah it's kind of a little hot for

398
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
me you know

399
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,480
i'm used to floating in like the 79 inch

400
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,159
range you know and that's

401
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
and that's you know in winter you know

402
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,039
so it's it's kind of it's touching it

403
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,440
it's touching it for me

404
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,879
even though for leds though because uh i

405
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
mean most manufacturers recommend you

406
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,838
run

407
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
higher temperatures like spectrum kicks

408
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,120
yeah spectrum king

409
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
brandon over there he recommended me to

410
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,159
run up to 87 degrees which

411
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
i thought was kind of crazy but what's

412
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,559
the

413
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
point of that what he had mentioned that

414
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,638
um you know in some places

415
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,278
weed grows naturally at this temperature

416
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,959
and high humidity so it can survive and

417
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,639
it's actually more happier and

418
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,239
and vpt charges

419
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,000
i know the higher humidity kind of helps

420
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,278
it out like in the 60 percentile range

421
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,679
kind of helps out with the flowers i

422
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,759
don't know

423
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,838
i mean my thing is with the heat problem

424
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,200
i'm kind of paranoid about you know

425
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
uh pottery mill doing everything because

426
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,920
i've had a bad experience with powdery

427
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
mildew before

428
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,519
um and that's with me picking up clones

429
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,799
from the dispensary that's why man

430
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
you got to be safe with where you're

431
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,559
getting cloned you got to make sure you

432
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
and

433
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,239
on top of that quarantine it because um

434
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
i brought the clone home and

435
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
it just was you know i didn't know what

436
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,120
the festival powder mill do until it hit

437
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
flower that's what pissed me off so much

438
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,159
about it

439
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
tell me about the quarantine situation a

440
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,039
little bit more like brick get the

441
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,560
clones bring them in put them in a

442
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,240
little tent by themselves

443
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,838
yeah put them somewhere away from your

444
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
main your main

445
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
stuff you got going at least for a few

446
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,800
weeks because i mean whatever that

447
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
that clone brings in you're going to

448
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,759
infest your garden with you know you got

449
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,519
to kind of think about that so

450
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,120
i would say quarantine it away from your

451
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
other plants and just like make sure you

452
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,919
keep up on like

453
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,919
you know your ipms and making sure you

454
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,919
know the maintenance is on point

455
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,838
now what if it's in a cloned dome one of

456
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,159
those small clone domes in like the the

457
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
corner of your tent for example is that

458
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,360
segregated enough or would you recommend

459
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
more than that i mean

460
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,399
man me i like you know i'm i'm heir of

461
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,360
caution you know

462
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,120
as being a grower you know a lot yeah

463
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,159
you go through a lot of problems i just

464
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
wouldn't want

465
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,719
you know you get a clone in the next

466
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
thing you know it's infested with mites

467
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
or something and then you know your

468
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,000
whole freaking garden has mites now

469
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
because

470
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,278
yeah you know for sure it's like co2

471
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,719
tanks if you're

472
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,559
if you're using co2 tanks and you're

473
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,920
exchanging them at the grow store

474
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,719
i mean they are they're they're just

475
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,879
mites pottery mildew anything that was

476
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
in the garden that that co2 tank was in

477
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,120
before

478
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
is gonna be on that tank now grow stores

479
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
are infested with

480
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,799
bugs and mildew and stuff so i worked at

481
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,800
one for three years i'm well aware

482
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,559
i used to tell people before you put

483
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,120
that co2 tank in your grow room you

484
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,000
better

485
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,799
bleach it or you know it's ideally keep

486
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,879
it outside of the room do you use co2

487
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,919
uh no i do not use co2 right now um

488
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,320
because i'm you know

489
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,919
my whole theory is that you know the ac

490
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
is actually bringing in a lot of co2 and

491
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,159
since i'm actually in the room

492
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,000
i you know i'm breathing breathing yeah

493
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,919
and all that good stuff so i mean

494
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,278
it's probably not enough co2 but i you

495
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,879
know i'm pretty comfortable with you

496
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,159
know not actually having a supplement

497
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,600
with it maybe and you know maybe it

498
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,360
might help to grow if i do

499
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
you know you know you never know but um

500
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,919
right now i'm not really too

501
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
big on me getting co2 well i wasn't just

502
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,759
going to say basement growing like if

503
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,759
you're

504
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,000
um if you're growing in the basement i

505
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,278
mean co2 is heavier than air

506
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,879
naturally if there's a bunch of people

507
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,240
living in the house co2 is probably

508
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,600
levels are probably going to be

509
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
higher down there i would assume from

510
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
its sinking yeah well i have a gang of

511
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
people you know

512
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,399
that stay in the house i live in a

513
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
pretty big house so you know i

514
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,078
i'm very confident about the co2 i don't

515
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,198
feel like i have to get external co2

516
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,958
right now

517
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,639
um although i think it may benefit

518
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,958
benefit to grow a little bit because you

519
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
know

520
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,799
steel two is really beneficial but so

521
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
i'm gonna just go through what we have

522
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,599
here

523
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,159
flower room led lights veg tent

524
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,000
cfls t5s i wanna say you said there's

525
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,919
led in there too

526
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
yeah there is there's one mars hydro 300

527
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,719
watt unit that's still in the tent just

528
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,480
to give it that you know that mixed

529
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,240
spectrum kind of sort of but um

530
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,240
yeah yeah everything is right now still

531
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
in veg because i just harvested

532
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,198
i'm still getting you know flowers

533
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,000
trimmed up and everything like that but

534
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,359
right now i still

535
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,039
just have plants in the veg the flower

536
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,919
room is kind of out of commission for

537
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,120
right now you know

538
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,958
you go through your harvest period and

539
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
you got to reset you know this it's a

540
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,679
whole process clean the room

541
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,839
for sure so are you growing hydro

542
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,039
soil cocoa bring bring me into that

543
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
department tell me a little bit about

544
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,120
that

545
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
growing in pro mix hp so i guess it is a

546
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,278
soil

547
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,199
soil medium if you right it doesn't have

548
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,799
any food in it though so you have to

549
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,479
feed it all the nutrients i have to

550
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,599
supplement all the time yes and

551
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,759
that's one of the things i like about

552
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,000
the pro-mix brand is just

553
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
i like the the controllability you have

554
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
when you know

555
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,000
you get to control it yourself you don't

556
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
have to worry like i said miracle grow

557
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
has

558
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,160
[ __ ] in it so right really you know

559
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,679
let's say you

560
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,120
you got the miracle grow soil you can't

561
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,000
really just go and dump nutrients in it

562
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,078
right now because it already you're

563
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,159
going to burn your plants it already has

564
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,078
stuff in it for sure and i want to say

565
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,360
pro-mix has beneficial bacteria in it

566
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,919
mycorrhizae

567
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,278
do you know does it either i i'm using

568
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,519
the one with the mycorrhizae in it as

569
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,198
well it's really beneficial for roots

570
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,198
and so do you like uh are you using

571
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,359
plastic pots or fabric pots

572
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,198
i'm using plastic right now i have a i

573
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
have a couple fabric pots outside i have

574
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,278
a little outdoor project that i'm doing

575
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,519
that's

576
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,879
in fabric pots but indoors i use mostly

577
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
plastic

578
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,240
and so you're not mixing anything with

579
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
the pro-mix just using that do you put

580
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,879
like clay pebbles in the bottom of the

581
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
pot or anything

582
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,519
no i was actually thinking about that to

583
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,279
kind of help as far as like with uh

584
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,400
drainage and stuff yeah drainage and

585
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,038
everything like that because i was

586
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,160
thinking

587
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,759
more so i'm like you know

588
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,720
because i'm going to try to scrog this

589
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,078
next round and flushing is my main

590
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,919
that that's been my main thing about the

591
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,198
scrog but i killed it last like you know

592
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,759
last round with the scrog everything

593
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,240
went well

594
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,318
but i was thinking that if i was to

595
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,919
layer the bottoms of the pots

596
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,359
with you know at least some clay pebbles

597
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,600
or something it would kind of help get

598
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,798
all

599
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,079
you know the excess salts uh oh for sure

600
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,119
you get what i'm saying to kind of not

601
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,240
have the plant just sitting in it

602
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,759
because like i said with the scrog you

603
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,519
kind of can't move it around

604
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,798
you can't but you're still you just told

605
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,400
me you're still killing it without the

606
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,000
clay pebbles so

607
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
yeah but you know i'm really ain't know

608
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,558
about the flushing thing i

609
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
really want to make sure that for sure i

610
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,720
just wanted the listeners to

611
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
to know and hear that like even if you

612
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,279
forget to put your clay pebbles in as

613
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,798
long as you

614
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,279
are careful and do all your youtube

615
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,359
homework you can still come out with a

616
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,038
a good girl most definitely most

617
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,399
definitely a lot of people think that

618
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,200
you have to have a lot of expensive

619
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720
equipment

620
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
literally i didn't start my channel off

621
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
with expensive equipment at all

622
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,279
i you know of course you know i got

623
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
youtube i got

624
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,200
i'm sorry i got leds you know later on

625
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,599
but i didn't just start you know i

626
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,279
didn't

627
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,798
start off with expensive equipment to

628
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,240
start my grow or my channel

629
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,079
you know you can grow without all of

630
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,919
that for sure and

631
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,279
so do you put your plants just like on

632
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
the ground in saucers or do you have

633
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,960
like a big tray or something

634
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,879
in saucers i've had them all in saucers

635
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,880
um i was thinking i wanted to actually

636
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
get an actual big tray for there so i

637
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
don't have to actually carry around all

638
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,120
the saucers and everything just kind of

639
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,038
coagulate in the same place and so can

640
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,399
you tell me like what size pots you use

641
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,599
how many plants and like what do your

642
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
roots look like when you pull them out

643
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,639
at the end

644
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
is it like filling up your whole pot

645
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
yeah and that's a problem that i've been

646
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,079
noticing as well um i'm using

647
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,399
five gallon tall pots for my main fire

648
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,240
room uh for veg everything is in a two

649
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,440
gallon right now except the the you know

650
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,519
the little babies

651
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,880
when do you transplant i like to see

652
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,639
i'm a little unorthodox with

653
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
transplanting i keep my plants in these

654
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
small containers for a little bit longer

655
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,319
than i should

656
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,240
i'm not even gonna lie to you guys um

657
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,200
you know when it's one person taking

658
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,480
care of like

659
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,160
20 plants or something yeah you know

660
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,000
and then you know i'm working on working

661
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,720
like that yeah it's a lot of work so i

662
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
kind of

663
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,160
you know drag on the transplant a little

664
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
bit man it's yeah are you

665
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,759
are you hand watering then or right yeah

666
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,279
right now i'm hand watering

667
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,480
i have a little watering wand that i you

668
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,678
know put into a little bucket and i'm

669
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,279
just you know

670
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,200
awesome and one more one more question

671
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,839
before i let mr grow it tick over again

672
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,319
what type of nutrients are you using now

673
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,720
um

674
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,439
i was last round using the rainbow i'm

675
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
i've been

676
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,919
every round i've been changed switching

677
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,199
nutrients and i know that's not really

678
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
not really a good idea for a lot of new

679
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,080
growers i don't want to tell anybody to

680
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,759
do that but i'm still trying to find

681
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,519
my niche i'm still trying to find what i

682
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,119
can dial in and what i can use

683
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,279
that's going to be you know convenient

684
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,918
more easier for me um as far as because

685
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,519
you know

686
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,960
i have a i have a i have people send me

687
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,798
nutrients all the time

688
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,798
but i really just want to find a simpler

689
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,960
way to supplement my plants

690
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,720
and not have to use so many bottles do

691
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,319
you pa well remo

692
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,600
before i ask this question how many

693
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,720
bottles does remo have i don't really

694
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,439
know much about them

695
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,319
i want to say seven i think it's about

696
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,600
seven bottles

697
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,038
[ __ ] but no it's like advanced but you

698
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,678
don't use all seven though you

699
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,279
use about foreign veg and then use about

700
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
five in flour

701
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,519
gotcha and do you have to adjust your ph

702
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,519
and you have a ppm meter

703
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,960
uh yes sir very very important things

704
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,079
that every grower should have

705
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,480
what kind of meters do you use i'm using

706
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,759
uh what is the name of my ph pen it was

707
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,519
it's uh

708
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,119
it's like an expensive one or is it just

709
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,720
like yeah it was about 80 bucks but the

710
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,479
thing about it is i had one of the cheap

711
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,759
i had the cheap chinese ones and they

712
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,759
worked good but

713
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,960
i don't know for some reason mine's died

714
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,640
out so i just

715
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,558
i was like i'm not gonna keep buying you

716
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
know spending forty dollars for a ph pen

717
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,519
i'll just go ahead and buy

718
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,279
the you know the eighty dollar digital

719
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,359
one it should be good

720
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,119
for sure yeah yeah the brand of uh ph

721
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,240
pen i have is is an eco tester

722
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,599
there we go eco yeah i'm familiar with

723
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,079
them we just used to sell a bunch of

724
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,158
them at the

725
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,439
grow shop yeah they're decent they're

726
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,480
waterproof right

727
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
yes sir and so when you're checking ph

728
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,319
and ppm you're doing

729
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,399
are you doing pre-feed are you doing

730
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,720
runoff or are you doing both

731
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,798
both both it's very important to do both

732
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,798
because i've had ph issues in the past

733
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,079
um you know i like to know what's going

734
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,440
on in my soil as well

735
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,960
um you know as well as when i'm

736
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
supplementing giving them the food

737
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,319
before

738
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,759
if that makes any sense yeah yeah and

739
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,399
what what

740
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,200
using pro-mix what ph range do you like

741
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
to stay in

742
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
and then throughout like um you know

743
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,480
growing what ppms do you try to keep

744
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
your plants in

745
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,319
ph wise i like to stay 6-2 in

746
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,119
in pro mix it's very comfortable the

747
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,720
plants do

748
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,879
really well um literally like i

749
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,798
if i keep it at 6-2 i don't have to

750
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,679
worry about lockout issues

751
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,839
now depending on the i remember i had a

752
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,360
really bad ph swing

753
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,879
the nutrients that you're using whatever

754
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,399
you supplement your plants you know like

755
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
flora nova i don't know if you guys are

756
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,038
familiar with that flora nova

757
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,480
scene it's like a thick organic

758
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,359
semi-organic whatever the hell you want

759
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
to call it

760
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:20,079
from gh uh-huh that thing

761
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,000
will cause some major like soil ph

762
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,759
wings for sure you have to make sure you

763
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
flush your your like if you're gonna use

764
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,640
that you gotta flush regularly like

765
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
literally because

766
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
you will get some major ph swings with

767
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,559
that for sure

768
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,240
sounds like you lived it oh yeah yeah

769
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,359
for sure

770
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
i'm really glad you're sharing that

771
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,759
information i was actually thinking

772
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
about trying out that line of nutrients

773
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,079
and it's good to hear that you know

774
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
tips like that i think is helpful for um

775
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,240
you know people

776
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
that currently use the nutrients or are

777
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,919
looking to use the nutrients so

778
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,080
yeah of course i know a lot of people

779
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,520
that have had very good success the

780
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,639
plants like when i immediately fed it

781
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,720
like especially the grow

782
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
it immediately gave like i love the fact

783
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,759
that it's just a one bottle

784
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
you know base no you know you don't have

785
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,079
to give it anything else literally you

786
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,600
could just feed it that and your plants

787
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,038
getting everything it needs

788
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,639
have you ever just grown fully

789
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,558
organically or like it

790
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,840
like the way that you're growing right

791
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,200
now has this kind of been the way that

792
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,199
you've always grown or have you ever

793
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,600
tried hydroponics or anything

794
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,558
i want to try hydro um and yeah the way

795
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,879
that i've been growing

796
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,000
right now i'm comfortable with you know

797
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,559
like like the medium like

798
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,599
i have cocoa i bought cocoa um a couple

799
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,279
weeks ago because i want to start

800
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,558
experimenting with cocoa because i think

801
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,879
that would be

802
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,319
the kind of it'll kind of be because you

803
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
know how it's a soilless medium you can

804
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,279
run it in hydro

805
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,879
and it can work very well with a hydro

806
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,480
system for sure

807
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
i'm since i'm so comfortable with soil i

808
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
think cocoa would be a really good

809
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,399
transition into hydro if you get what

810
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,880
i'm saying

811
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
um because i'm so familiar with the soil

812
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,679
base

813
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,880
it's kind of it's kind of similar just

814
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,320
definitely and uh the it's you can

815
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,240
over water in cocoa like if you

816
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,678
transplant a plant in the coca-cola and

817
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,000
then you don't let the roots

818
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,440
um establish themselves and then start

819
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
hammering it with water you definitely

820
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
can over water

821
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,759
but once those roots are established in

822
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,919
coco coir

823
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,440
you can hook up a drip system you can

824
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
water you can just really you can water

825
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,798
the [ __ ] out of them and

826
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
the plants love it as long as you have

827
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,558
good drainage most definitely good

828
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
drainage is always key

829
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,519
really key what about your ventilation

830
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
system do we talk about that yet like

831
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,599
what are you using for like an inline

832
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,400
fan

833
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,599
ducting out of the room i don't remember

834
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
if you said that and then do you have

835
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,959
like a lot of air circulation going on

836
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,798
with them oh yeah i have a [ __ ] kind of

837
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
air circulation as far as with inline

838
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,918
and out

839
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
i do not need as right now i don't need

840
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,400
it because the way

841
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
everything is like i said my room the

842
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,000
flowers is an open closet you know it's

843
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,319
it's a huge room and it i shaded off

844
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
with uh you know for the dark period i

845
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,000
shaded off with a plastic

846
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,079
sheeting over you know some panels over

847
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,200
the door out over the doorway so

848
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,918
um and at the top there is um there's a

849
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
little set

850
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,038
now i'm not gonna say a little section

851
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,079
it's a section where air

852
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,158
mo it it's it blows blows

853
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,599
i don't even need a ventilation system

854
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,360
it's pretty much what i'm getting at

855
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,359
do you have a lot of fans like us i have

856
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,558
a [ __ ] i have a whole ton of fans going

857
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,918
on through this room like

858
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:13,119
as i'm sitting here right now i can feel

859
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,440
the wind just nice that's awesome

860
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,278
so what what do you think your like

861
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,360
biggest catastrophe

862
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,519
was or your biggest failure growing i

863
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,000
would have to say my biggest

864
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,440
biggest fail with the grow would have

865
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
been that powdery mildew

866
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,120
incident but it didn't even collapse my

867
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
grow too much because

868
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,399
i mean i still ended up harvesting the

869
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,399
plant i just did it though jose

870
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,759
cervantes way you know how he you know

871
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
washes the buds after

872
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,359
harvest and everything with the peroxide

873
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,559
bath and everything i did it that way

874
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,439
and it kind of just washed the mildew

875
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,960
away but

876
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,558
what does he do can you explain that

877
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,079
because i have no idea what that

878
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,038
is he he watches um if he has a video on

879
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,519
it too

880
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,720
he for to get rid of powdery mildew on

881
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,679
your buds

882
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,120
um he takes the bud you know after

883
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,679
harvest he cuts it off

884
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,959
and he he has some water he has a bath

885
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,080
mixed up with some uh

886
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,159
hydrogen peroxide i think it's like uh

887
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,359
one teaspoon per like five gallons of

888
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,400
like hydrogen

889
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,079
you know hydrogen peroxide and then um

890
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,519
he just washes the buds and you can see

891
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,960
the powdery mildew float all over the

892
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,798
top of the water

893
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,880
have you seen this mr growit yeah i've

894
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,918
seen it you gotta watch it it's it's

895
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,400
definitely a controversial topic um some

896
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,320
people are

897
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,679
so against blood washing but i mean yeah

898
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,480
it's kind of scary seeing him

899
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
submerge an entire branch all the way

900
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
under water

901
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,798
um yeah it's pretty it's pretty gross

902
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,959
[ __ ] ton of powdery mildew yeah

903
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,000
hydrogen peroxide washed bugs i've never

904
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,278
heard of that that's

905
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,200
i'm not saying but if you really think

906
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,240
about it like super sanitizing your butt

907
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
but you just have to make sure you get

908
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
all that excess water out you don't want

909
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
to have rot or anything so

910
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,399
how he did it was he had a fan he had

911
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,759
him hanging up after he washed him and

912
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
bathed him and everything he rinsed them

913
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,919
down

914
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,119
and then he had him hanging on this

915
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,400
little rack and he just had the fan

916
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,079
blowing on him just to make sure you got

917
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,278
all that excess moisture out

918
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,639
because you know you don't want that in

919
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,319
your butt and everything you know pretty

920
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,320
cool i did that with mine and

921
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,599
it worked i ended up having a pretty

922
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,119
cool harvest but

923
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,158
i mean it you know is this something

924
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,278
that you know it's not nothing you want

925
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
to you know have in the back of your

926
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,440
mind that you have power removed on your

927
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,080
butt you know

928
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,519
yeah smoking mildew you know yeah it's

929
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,038
nasty

930
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,558
i'd rather wash that [ __ ] and some

931
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,720
hydrogen peroxide

932
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
i didn't know that's crazy man i gotta

933
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,839
watch that video dude i've watched

934
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,120
people cut down like

935
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,959
crops because they don't want to deal

936
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,158
with powdery mildew i've made it oh for

937
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,640
sure yeah

938
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,640
hurts like oh man you could have dunked

939
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
that [ __ ] in a bucket of water and kept

940
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
it no but you know you gotta think about

941
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,759
the labor for that too man you got about

942
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,359
100 plants from pm you know you gotta

943
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,759
dump all those it's kind of like

944
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,359
yeah i mean when that much shits on the

945
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,960
line you gotta get creative

946
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,479
you do you do and that's a very creative

947
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,079
way because you i mean you can literally

948
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,480
see the powdery mildew like

949
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,278
just off the bud floating on the water

950
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,038

954
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240

994

in there four straight

995
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,558
four plants of the gorilla smash over a

996
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,558
pound

997
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,240
in my little in my little grow area you

998
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,678
guys now if you have to check it out you

999
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
have to watch it for you to really see

1000
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,240
that was perfect i didn't have any

1001
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,158
problems on that grow

1002
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,319
everything went as smooth as can be i

1003
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,320
ran it nine weeks straight

1004
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,839
harvested at nine weeks everything was

1005
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,278
just perfect

1006
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,959
perfect flush everything what you and um

1007
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,798
you're like for drying your stuff do you

1008
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,079
do you you like do you use dehumidifier

1009
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:40,558
or anything like what's your what's your

1010
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,439
drying

1011
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,398
situation like so i dry in my actual

1012
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
room and my

1013
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,918
because i have the ac in here it kind of

1014
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,278
keeps the room really cool so the

1015
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,759
problem is actually cooler than the

1016
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,398
actual fire room so if it's 82 in the

1017
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,038
room in

1018
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,398
the flower room it's about 72 it's like

1019
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,119
10 degrees it's a diff it's a difference

1020
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,319
for sure like

1021
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,639
literally you can walk out the flower

1022
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,000
room and feel the difference so

1023
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,759
um with me having the lights off and

1024
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
everything once i harvest i like to

1025
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,440
give myself two weeks before i actually

1026
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
reset the flower room so within that two

1027
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,679
weeks i have everything drying and it's

1028
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,000
like a 60

1029
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,360
it's like a 69 ish 69 degrees

1030
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,919
uh about 50 52 degrees humidity

1031
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,959
i mean 50 humidity and i like to dry

1032
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,278
around there and

1033
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,079
i'd keep it about seven to ten days

1034
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,079
depending

1035
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,278
i'll keep it longer if it's a you know

1036
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,960
if i got some girths

1037
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,200
if you had to dip them in water or

1038
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,640
anything oh no i haven't had you they've

1039
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,679
been in water

1040
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,640
i haven't had any p.m since that problem

1041
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,120
yeah that's good i made sure of that i

1042
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,679
made sure

1043
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,119
that but yeah i like to dry 60 i drive

1044
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,759
around 69

1045
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,839
degrees 52 humidity uh 7 to 10 days

1046
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
and depending on if i have some fat ass

1047
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,359
but like some fat buds i'll keep it a

1048
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
little longer just to make sure

1049
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,119
but um yeah that's pretty much the baby

1050
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,038
j

1051
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,239
dry method that's awesome and you're

1052
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,759
still you're are you still rolling the

1053
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,640
same wattage in your flower room as you

1054
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,158
were when you got this healed

1055
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
and you just had a harvest so you'll be

1056
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,320
able to maybe update us on

1057
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,519
or you know on your yield from this

1058
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,839
harvest you think it's gonna be bigger

1059
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,079
or

1060
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,959
good too if anything it's gonna be about

1061
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,720
the same um

1062
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,399
because i had two plants in there it's

1063
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,839
actually the pheno2 of the same strain

1064
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,319
that i got a pound off of

1065
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,959
but um it's because of the phenol it's

1066
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,038
not as

1067
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,319
heavy yielding so i'm not going to get

1068
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:27,440
you know as heavy yielding properties

1069
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,879
that's why that's one of the reasons why

1070
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,240
i didn't keep that pheno

1071
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
but um i should pull pretty close too

1072
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
because the mayhem bears which is

1073
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,158
another string from canon genetics

1074
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,120
is i mean the budge i mean mr grow it if

1075
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,120
you

1076
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,319
you you seen these buds are freaking

1077
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,319
huge man

1078
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,480
yeah i've seen some of your uh some of

1079
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,079
your recent videos like i said and um

1080
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,839
it's really impressive if you guys

1081
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,199
haven't seen uh baby jay's garden you've

1082
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,798
got to go over to her channel and check

1083
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,880
it out because she's

1084
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,119
really growing some really nice healthy

1085
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
plants thank you so much man

1086
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,158
i think we got one more question for you

1087
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,960
mr growit uh

1088
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,919
the loaded question yeah you usually ask

1089
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,759
this one i like this one

1090
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,120
i like this question all right so so

1091
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,599
listen to this one

1092
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,719
knowing what you know now if you can go

1093
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,798
back in time

1094
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,240
and talk to yourself right before you

1095
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,599
started your first grow

1096
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,599
what advice would you give yourself

1097
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,840
simple do not mix a gallons worth of

1098
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,839
nutrients in a little mini bottle

1099
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,359
that is the worst mistake you could ever

1100
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,720
make because it was like immediate

1101
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,240
like it was immediate damage like

1102
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,640
literally the plant started wilting

1103
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,720
immediately when it got defeating

1104
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
wow oh man i wish that would have been

1105
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,278
on video

1106
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,000
oh my god i met you guys i kind of wish

1107
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,278
i didn't because

1108
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,038
i'm one of those i like to show my

1109
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,079
mistakes just so people know that i'm

1110
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,319
not you know

1111
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,398
i you know i have mistakes still too you

1112
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,678
know with growing you're going to have

1113
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,398
you're going to run into mistakes all

1114
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,240
the time so

1115
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,678
i like to document everything and i

1116
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,038
really wish i was more comfortable back

1117
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
then to be able to document that because

1118
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,000
that was some it was funny it was really

1119
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
funny every time i talk tell people

1120
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,319
about that

1121
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,159
they just crack up yeah it would be

1122
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,000
sweet to watch like a time lapse video

1123
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,200
and fast forward of like the plant

1124
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,839
reacting to

1125
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,038
being over fed or underwatered or like

1126
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,359
stuff like that

1127
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,480
but yeah i would i would say you know

1128
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,839
makes my ratios

1129
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
you know and i need to get better with

1130
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,240
mixing my ratios for the nutrients

1131
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,319
i would say get my i should have got my

1132
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
ac unit sooner because

1133
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,960
i was running into heat issues with my

1134
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,000
cfls because like when once it gets hot

1135
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
it gets hot

1136
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,599
and the humidity was high and i started

1137
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,519
getting fungus gnats i'm you know

1138
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,119
i still get fungus in that till the day

1139
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,399
but i got a really bad fungus in that

1140
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,518
infestation

1141
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,719
um on my season three so i would say get

1142
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,919
my temperature and everything under

1143
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,839
control

1144
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,278
have better air circulation because if i

1145
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,639
would have had better air circulation

1146
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,079
in that flower room i would probably

1147
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,360
wouldn't have had as bad of a fungus

1148
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,599
that infestation

1149
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,959
as i did so baby j what um do you have

1150
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,398
anything like upcoming are you working

1151
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,720
on like any projects or anything

1152
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,479
what's what's the next reason of course

1153
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,919
i want everybody to stay tuned for the

1154
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,360
breeding project that i have going on

1155
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,960
right now i mean i'm harvesting a [ __ ]

1156
