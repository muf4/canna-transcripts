1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,599

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,960
grow room can you explain what equipment

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,960
you had back then how was set up how

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,480
many plants you were growing so on and

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,240
so forth so yeah when I

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:19,160
um previously I would say like a month

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,920
or two before the pimp my girl um before

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,560
you guys all came out I was like trying

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,240
different things that I was on offer up

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,038
and I was on like Facebook groups like

11
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,799
getting different tents and trying to

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
they were all like tents that would have

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
like holes in them little rip on the

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,359
side or something like but uh there's uh

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,719
the room that you guys ended up coming

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,200
in that had a couple plants in I think

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,280
if you go back to my YouTube uh couple

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,840
previous videos before that I had a huge

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,239
10 by 10 I got from somebody on offer up

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,440
with no like uh I still have the small

21
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,599
light in there um there was no intake

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,439
fan there was no like fans moving around

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,679
the air and I kept walking in that one

24
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,358
room you guys came in to help build out

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,719
and pretty much you couldn't even walk

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
it was like you walk in barely be able

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,560
to crack the door and walk in there and

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,280
it was like 100 degrees bro and I was

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,600
only able to do that for a couple days I

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,079
was like this is crazy there's no way

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:19,319
I'm going to be able to do this um this

32
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,879
is super cheap like almost camping tent

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,478
so I ended up taking that out and at

34
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,199
that time I had so many plants that uh

35
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:29,239
it just wasn't working out I didn't know

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,560
how to like control my VPD I didn't know

37
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,599
how to do any of that especially with

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,240
the stuff I had I was still trying but

39
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,679
um I I I would watch videos I knew what

40
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,000
I was supposed to get Target wise it

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,920
just wasn't hitting from me things and

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,159
in areas and different type of T that

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,478
wasn't working so

44
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,399
um originally when you guys hit me up uh

45
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,438
Joe told me he was like yo this is this

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399

47
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,158
everything you're doing but

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,680
um we can't come when there's in all

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,799

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,200
and um I thought that was sick I was

51
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,560
like you know this is super dope um and

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,919
I ended up basically

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,560
uh making

54
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,919
um everything the way it it needed to be

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,080
to be like you know to have have a dope

56
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,359
show and um I I took so many plants to

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,440
my girlfriend's

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,959
house it it was wild like uh in in the

59
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,199
the big U-Haul boxes that you hang CL in

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,039
I like packed those in and took all my

61
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,919
plants to my girlfriend's house and by

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,719
that time that I had to bring everything

63
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,000
back and everything was just everything

64
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,158
was so dead and everything was so bent

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
over

66
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:52,759
and it was just it was wild a wild

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,919
time definitely a moment to remember

68
00:02:52,759 --> 00:03:00,318
forever but is such a crazy story yeah I

69
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:03,280
remember walking into your old setup and

70
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,518
you had the light how did you how you it

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,080
was on some sort of I'm trying to think

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,280
of what he even call that it was a two

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,400
two tripod posts for like regular lights

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,759
I think like the uh I forgot the brain

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:26,400
but two regular um soft light sticks

76
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:31,238
tripods and a pole across it for hanging

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:35,319
backdrop and I had a Viper Spectrum 150

78
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,480
on one side and I believe yeah I think

79
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,119
two Viper spcs hanging on that it was

80
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,199
just giving the plants enough light to

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,000
keep them alive and it was open room at

82
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,560
that point there was no air exhausting

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,199
out the room at all it's kind of just

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,759
like not even a sealed room um but yeah

85
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,919
when you guys came I was like on the

86
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,840

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,759

89
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,119
even know that it could go any farther

90
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,759
or go like I had all these dreams and

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,920
