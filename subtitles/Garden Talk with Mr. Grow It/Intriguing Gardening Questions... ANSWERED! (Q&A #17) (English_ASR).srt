1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
hey what's up everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,940
my channel for those of you that don't

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,560
know me my name is Chris aka Mr Grow it

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,120
and today I've got a q a video for you

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,919
just want to clarify one thing real

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,419
quick and the last video I released on

7
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,039
this channel I imagine I'm taking a

8
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,679
break that's for the garden Talk podcast

9
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,259
only I will still upload videos to this

10
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,579
channel such as these q a videos if you

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,260
want to ask me questions and potentially

12
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,979
get featured in one of these q a videos

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,779
follow me on Twitch twitch.tv Mr Grow it

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,519
make sure notifications are on that way

15
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,079
you'll be notified when I go live next

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,699
and then you can come hang out and ask

17
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,579
some questions that is all I have for

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,340
now let's get into today's questions

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,620
when reamending your soil could use the

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,899
water from your dehumidifier to moist on

21
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,699
the soil I say thumbs up to that and I'm

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,500
kind of going off of a study and this

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,600
one is by question let me pull it up

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,399
right here Quest dehumidifiers what this

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,140
is is they got a lot of feedback of

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,539
people saying that you shouldn't use

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,340
water from your dehumidifier because it

28
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,260
contains heavy metals so what they did

29
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,120
was they went and tested that and they

30
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,698
found uh right here you can see my mouse

31
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,739
pointer aluminum copper zinc so it did

32
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,359
show some copper but remember copper is

33
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,219
an element that the plant can uptake

34
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,420
they did all different tests I'll

35
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,099
actually put this in the twitch chair

36
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,420
right now we've seen some aluminum and

37
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,938
there's some copper but there's such

38
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,260
small amounts very little impact parts

39
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,158
per billion I think is what they were

40
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,079
saying I'm not going to read through the

41
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,700
whole study here but check it out in the

42
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,259
description section below if you want to

43
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,118
reference that study and learn more

44
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,000
about it got a question from Mr growett

45
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,219
where should I buy the auto parts so I

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,659
recommend happy Hydro to go there and

47
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,700
buy them they're actually a sponsor of

48
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,979
this video so big shout out to them auto

49
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,379
parts are an awesome Auto watering

50
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,599
system there's no timers or electricity

51
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,259
and they have systems for all size

52
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,179
operations I use the autopod XL in the

53
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,099
past really got some great results using

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,159
it they have systems look at this 100

55
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,099
pot system they have 16 pot systems nine

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,960
pot systems 60 pot systems so they have

57
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,759
really for any applications you're

58
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,739
looking for and it also comes with a

59
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,299
reservoir on a lot of these kits so

60
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,679
definitely check them out I have a link

61
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,360
to the auto parts on the happy hydro

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,700
website down in the YouTube description

63
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,618
section below if you had one trellis net

64
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,618
when is the best time to put it in

65
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,120
during veg or right before flower I

66
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,340
think it you're going to get mixed

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,920
answers depending on who you ask I would

68
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,598
add it in veg before flipping the flour

69
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,458
but there have been times where I added

70
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,840
in the trellis net after flipping a

71
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,700
flower because I realized I was going to

72
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,560
need some support you know the branches

73
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,238
kind of starting to flop over and just

74
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,920
like the structure kind of looking at it

75
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,300
looked like it it was going to be one of

76
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,219
those plants where once it gets deep

77
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,840
into the flowering stage the branches

78
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,459
are just going to be too weak to kind of

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,098
kind of hold its buds so I personally

80
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,840
will add in the trellis nut during

81
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,119
vegetation stage at most times and then

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,739
I'll work that plant into the trellis as

83
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,719
it's continuing to grow on the veg stage

84
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,000
and then once it's just about filled up

85
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,680
or I don't really fill up my tense wall

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,659
to wall you know whenever the structures

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,340
where I kind of want to be it is what I

88
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,780
should say that's when I'll go ahead and

89
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,939
I'll flip it now I've made the mistake

90
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,860
of continuing to bend down those

91
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,479
branches for several weeks into

92
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,400
flowering and then of course the

93
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,079
branches were kind of stuck under and

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,939
stop stretching and then the buds were

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
kind of within the knit so I don't

96
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,019
recommend doing that I think you know

97
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,939
moving forward I'm only really doing

98
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,560
seven days the first seven days of the

99
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,060
stretch phase after switching life cycle

100
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,378
tucking down branches and then after

101
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,239
that kind of letting it go from there

102
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,699
what week of flour do you pollinate your

103
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
plants when making seeds how long do you

104
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,839
let them mature before Harvest I forget

105
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,300
who said this but pollinate the plants

106
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,939
when they look horny as funny as that

107
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,219
may seem you can kinda think about it

108
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,479
there is that point where the flowers

109
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,158
have grown to the point where there's

110
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,259
pistols just bursting out everywhere

111
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,639
typically it's around day 28 in the

112
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,959
flowering stage now of course it's going

113
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,419
to depend on if you're talking about

114
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,739
when flipping the light cycle when the

115
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,878
plant starts to show flowering so it's

116
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,640
really hard to give you an exact answer

117
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,199
but look around 28 days or so that's

118
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,000
typically when I pollinate when the

119
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,619
plant looks horny enough to uh want to

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,900
be pollinated who do you recommend for

121
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,980
water testing very hard water 800 PPM

122
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,379
from the tap a lot of people go through

123
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,179
Logan Labs check out them I'm not the

124
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,399
best person to talk to when it comes

125
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,140
about different testing facilities Logan

126
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,879
Labs is just one of those common ones

127
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,378
they do both soil testing as well as

128
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,780
water testing but I definitely want to

129
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,000
refer you over to the soil doctor Bryant

130
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,620
Mason he was actually my podcast years

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,479
ago now really good episode talking

132
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,639
about soil testing he would be the one

133
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,858
to kind of give you insight about water

134
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,418
testing and he can actually review your

135
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,219
results and kind of give you feedback on

136
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,418
what nutrition you know what your

137
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,860
nutrition regimen should be what

138
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,079
amendments you can add in how long do

139
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,020
you just want to sit before reusing

140
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,000
after amending it man I have planted in

141
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,620
it right away I've waited a week I've

142
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,959
waited two weeks I've waited a month

143
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,060
I've waited 60 days it's hard to give

144
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,620
you the answer on what the best time is

145
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,120
right every single time no matter what

146
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,040
even when I planted in the same day I

147
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,720
mended it it turned out to be fine so

148
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,639
some people that is it for seven days 14

149
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,620
days 30 days you can hear different

150
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,720
recommendations from different people my

151
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,220
personal opinion 7 to 14 days and it

152
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,300
should be fun I guess it's also going to

153
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,040
depend on how much you're actually

154
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,259
amending in if you're loading it with

155
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,540
nutrition it could become hot really

156
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,520
quick risky in a way but yeah you're

157
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,740
just gonna have to just try it have you

158
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,599
tried singing it grow or have you done

159
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,220
just fully organic or fully bottled

160
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,139
nutrients absolutely definitely done

161
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,880
sanganic got some really good results

162
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,900
doing sanganic and there's so many

163
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,519
different ways you can kind of go about

164
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,799
it right I think a lot of people will

165
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,319
traditionally go sanganic where they

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,240
start off with a potting mix that

167
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,399
includes organic nutrients in it so for

168
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,840
example Fox foam ocean for soil and I

169
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,978
know they're not um recertified or

170
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,138
anything like that there's some specular

171
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,240
relation whether or not that mix is

172
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,100
organic or not but assuming it is

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
organic that's an example where you

174
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,180
start off with a fox emotion Force mix

175
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
and then you're adding in synthetic

176
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,300
nutrients throughout the grill that's

177
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,000
one way of doing synchronic I've done

178
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,978
that I've also done started off and just

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,160
in a nursing or soil with not much

180
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:49,918
nutrition in it add in organic blend of

181
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,660
amendments and also fed in synthetics

182
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,698
throughout the grill it's a way to grow

183
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,680
where if you need that fast acting

184
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,840
response like say the plant is starting

185
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,038
to show like a sign of deficiency or

186
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,779
whatever that's what I really like to

187
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,639
just say okay let me give it a real

188
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,839
light dose of synthetic nutrients

189
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,139
something that's in a plant available

190
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,279
form and so I can see the fast recovery

191
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,860
so I don't have anything against

192
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,239
synganic I think it's a great way to go

193
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,819
about it you can get some really good

194
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,740
results with it so I don't discriminate

195
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,300
organic versus synthetic I'm not

196
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,759
somebody who's going to be they refer to

197
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,900
them as organic snobs to where it's all

198
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,879
organic and that's the only thing

199
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,500
everybody who grows up bottles are

200
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,600
terrible people bottles of her babies

201
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,220
you know

202
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,199
that's not me although I really haven't

203
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,139
been using a lot of synthetic nutrients

204
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,120
in the past two years now it's really

205
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,759
just been organic organic inputs whether

206
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,899
that be compost or dry amendments you

207
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,580
know whether it be a bland or individual

208
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,159
amendments it's just been a little bit

209
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,800
easier for me my style of growing to use

210
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,020
Organics but yes organic is is awesome

211
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,939
when you add your power Bloom dry

212
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,978
amendments when flipping the flower

213
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,379
before changing lights I go after is

214
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:58,199
power bloom a brand because if it is

215
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:01,259
then I don't use that but any blend that

216
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,900
I use organic blend I'm adding in a top

217
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,120
dressing prior to flipping flour so

218
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,758
usually it'll be upwards of seven days

219
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,560
before flipping flour sometimes it's on

220
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,300
the day of Flipping The Flower I'll top

221
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,339
dress but yeah it's either on or before

222
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,620
flipping the flowers when I'll add in

223
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,119
that top dressing of organic inputs and

224
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,000
then after that once I change the light

225
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,740
cycle it's usually about 30 days 20 to

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,598
30 days is when I'm doing that next top

227
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,060
dressing get the book Chris may even

228
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,219
autograph it for you I would yeah I mean

229
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,620
if you get it from my website mrgrow.com

shipping to the us though through my

236
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,079
book just because it's so much money to

237
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,339
ship to a different country although if

238
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,639
you're in a different country other than

239
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:49,560
the US Canada Europe anywhere check your

240
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,879
local Amazon it should be available on

241
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,120
your local Amazon so you can actually go

242
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,478
to Amazon.com or dot EU or dot UK or

243
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,098
Amazon dot what else CA amazon.de all

244
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,079
those should be available there just

245
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,879
search just for my book and thanks to

246
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,379
everyone who has left a review on that

247
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,240
book on Amazon that has helped out

248
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,959
tremendously it's over I think it's 1

249
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,939
200 reviews on that listing blows my

250
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,620
mind I'm so thankful that you guys take

251
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,939
the time to actually go there leave a

252
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,918
review some people have uploaded

253
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,439
pictures of it some people have uploaded

254
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,060
videos onto Amazon and showed during

255
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,500
their review that helps me out

256
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,120
tremendously so thank you so much this

257
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,000
it's really gone beyond my expectations

258
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,918
as far as getting reviews on Amazon so

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,598
once again thank you Enviro cleanse

260
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,000
works really well can't even tell I have

261
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,439
54. I have the Enviro cleanse do you

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,979
work with them grow 10 I'm kind of

263
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,779
curious because uh van they suck with

264
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,339
communication I can't even support them

265
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,379
anymore because their communication is

266
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,339
just so bad I'd be interested know if

267
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,500
you're able to get a hold of somebody

268
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,940
because I need to get a hold of somebody

269
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,039
is it beneficial to top dress with

270
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,800
Organics and then introduce microbes

271
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,778
yeah absolutely you can totally top

272
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,639
dress with Organics then include

273
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,259
microbes now it depends on what you're

274
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,059
talking about here give me a second one

275
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,259
cat here wants to jump up on my lap so

276
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,759
let me go organic so you're talking

277
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,620
about like an organic input like compost

278
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,439
includes a lot of those beneficials

279
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,360
already so adding in a micro product

280
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
people can will still do it but you

281
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
might not really need to some people say

282
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,278
you don't need to but yeah if your top

283
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
dressing with just like an organic Blend

284
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,958
or whatever you can totally inoculate

285
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,119
with microbes after before during after

286
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,619
yeah absolutely now a lot of people that

287
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,940
say you should avoid buying micro pucks

288
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,740
altogether because you can get them from

289
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,440
your backyard with the IMO process

290
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,299
that's one stance on it but a lot of

291
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,640
people will for convenience purposes buy

292
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,458
microbes and inoculate their medium can

293
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,679
you overuse molasses in a grow I use a

294
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,299
small amount to adjust my ph's watering

295
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,939
along with nutrients so I actually

296
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,139
created a whole video on molasses and I

297
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,880
think that's one thing I said in the

298
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,799
video is oh you really can't overuse

299
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,600
this I got roast in the comments a

300
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,159
little bit it was kind of funny yeah of

301
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,680
course if you like if you're pouring a

302
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,059
bottle onto your medium that's overdoing

303
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,278
it right what I kind of meant by that

304
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,559
was like if you're using a teaspoon per

305
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,838
gallon or tablespoon per gallon of water

306
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,819
and some people are doing it throughout

307
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,380
the entire Grill successfully so that's

308
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,480
kind of what I meant that video by over

309
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,220
not being able to overdo it you can

310
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,379
certainly do small amounts throughout

311
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,778
the grow and be fine I personally found

312
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,059
most value in it in the flowering stage

313
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,259
mid to late flowering is usually when I

314
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,179
like to do it done it throughout the

315
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,740
grill before no problem every single

316
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,539
watering or every other watering I've

317
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,360
done that as well and it's been fine

318
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,679
have you tried or considered doing

319
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,919
Hydroponics yeah this is kind of a hot

320
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,379
Topic in my world I I get asked this a

321
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,679
lot and I have not done a true

322
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,360
hydroponic growth such as dwc Coco is

323
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,299
considered Hydroponics I've done that

324
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,399
but dwc system for example that's one

325
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,319
very common system that people use when

326
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,259
growing in Hydroponics I have not used

327
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,820
yet my only concern is that the water

328
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,319
temperature of the reservoir

329
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,360
unfortunately where I live I feel like

330
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,399
it would be difficult to control and for

331
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,500
me being a small home grower I feel like

332
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,720
got me investing for all the equipment

333
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,519
and then monitoring it I think it's a

334
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,139
little bit more to monitor it say

335
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
something like oh Hydroponics is easy

336
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,578
it's easier than growing in soil it's

337
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
better than growing in soil you higher

338
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,599
yield you get better Terps you know you

339
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,059
hear everything from so many different

340
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,278
people but the reason why I speaking for

341
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,018
myself haven't yet grown Hydroponics

342
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,600
here is just because the temperature

343
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,919
gets so high here that I think it's

344
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,320
going to be hard to control the water

345
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,059
temperature it needs to be between I

346
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,820
believe it's 68 and 74 degrees

347
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,899
Fahrenheit is the optimal temperature I

348
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,060
could be slightly off on that don't

349
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,639
quote me on it but if it goes 75 degrees

350
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,219
Fahrenheit or higher you're at risk for

351
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,439
bad pathogens I could potentially do a

352
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,540
dwc run in the winter time which is

353
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,120
something I really I should do I want to

354
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,259
do because temperatures are cold and I I

355
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,060
don't think I'm gonna have to worry

356
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,700
about the water temperature as much as I

357
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,619
will in spring summer and fall so yeah I

358
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,839
haven't really tried doing a dvwc System

359
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,700
hydroponic system like that yep but I'd

360
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,839
love to try one in the future when I

361
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
feel like it's going to be a little bit

362
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,860
easier have you done an episode on K and

363
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,839
F do you have one planned yes I've done

364
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,919
a couple I think this episode right here

365
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,140
with Green Goblin episode number 47 is

366
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,179
another one that he does talk about knf

367
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,360
a little bit in there greens goddess

368
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,219
episode 57 this is a good one on knf

369
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,200
she's freaking awesome this one right

370
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,240
here has a lot of stuff about knf

371
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,480
episode 59 and then the last one I'll

372
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,919
recommend Chris Trump well known for knf

373
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,259
a lot people say this is a must watch

374
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,379
episode number 67 so check those ones

375
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:27,379
out

376
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,039
thank you
