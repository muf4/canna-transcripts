gardening outdoor so lots and lots of

74
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,158
people have been requesting outdoor

75
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,079
content uh we do a lot of content

76
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,318
gardening indoors but first can you tell

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,599
us a little bit about yourself and how

78
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:51,958
you got into gardening so I go by SE

79
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:55,518
bunny grow I'm a single mom of two sons

80
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,719
with uh special needs I'm French

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,800
Canadian up up until I'm a late bloomer

82
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,680
so up until 7 years ago I had never even

83
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,439
seen this wonderful plant that we all

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,760
come to know and love so I started by uh

85
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:17,000
helping defoliation defoliated started

86
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:21,238
watering them and about two years ago I

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,439
decided I wanted to do it solo I grew a

88
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,360
great passion for it and I just couldn't

89
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,519
wait to learn more about it and learn

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
quicker than I was being shown awesome

91
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,759
so you're mostly outdoors I looked at

92
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,438
your Instagram I I believe you do a

93
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,079
little bit of indoors as well but uh see

94
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,959
a lot of big plants outdoors I got to

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,280
ask do you start your seeds indoors and

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,360
veg them for a little while and then

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,039
transfer to Outdoors or are you planting

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,760
directly Outdoors so for indoor what

99
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:55,120
I'll do is I'll start in a Solo Cup I'll

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,359
use promix and I will start it in the

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,799
tent till they have about their first

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,879
set of leaves then I'll transfer them to

103
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,640
to the secondary location where the

104
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,840
outdoors go so that hardening off

105
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,958
process right I assume you're not just

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,680
taking them from the indoors and then

107
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,479
putting them into Outdoors direct

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,640
sunlight and just leaving them like that

109
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,759
right there's a hardening off period so

110
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,478
they don't die can you talk to us about

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,879
that period like how do you do that

112
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,000
transition so when they do go to the

113
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,240
second location they are put in the

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,439
garage and I do put them on the window

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,360
seal so they do get a little bit used to

116
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,038
hard in off and then um once they're a

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,879
little bit bigger I do bring them

118
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,879
outside so I'll put them in the shade

119
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,519
for most of the day and then I'll put

120
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:46,399
them in the St for a couple hours let

121
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,918
them get uh used to the to the weather

122
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,799
and the change of of lights because you

123
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,959
go from an LED to the sun which is a big

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,639
big difference so you're starting off

125
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,279
like day one they're doing maybe what

126
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,000
two hours direct sunlight and then

127
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,719
you're kind of gradually ramping up day

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,038
by day one of getting like full sun once

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,440
they're once I transpl plant them from

130
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,599
the Solo Cup into the bigger cup so

131
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,800
they're decent size when I transfer them

132
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,000
into their fore ever home then they get

133
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,520
a full sun all day long and then full

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,560
sun are we talking 10 hours are we

135
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,959
talking 12 hours so depending the month

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,519
usually we'll

137
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:31,599
say

138
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:33,359
from 6: a.m. till about 9: : p.m. okay

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,680
and then the entire time they have sun

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,479
on them or is there some like shade uh

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
no direct sunlight okay now are you in

142
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,279
containers or are you planting them in

143
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,680
ground I actually use plastic containers

144
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,959
uh plastic pots they could be anywhere

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,840
from 25 gallons to 10 gallons depending

146
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,758
how many I'm doing if I ran out of the

147
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,560
25 gallons and I'll I'll do the the 10

148
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,600
gallons usually I'll put the Clones in

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,360
the 10 g g in and I'll put the seedlings

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,160
in the bigger pots then what do you have

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
what's your in your soil mix there are

152
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,160
you in a cocoa are you in a soil what

153
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,800
fertiliz you using so on and so forth so

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,479
for outdoors I've actually this year I'm

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,079
using um old Marsh soil from a swamp

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,719
down the road from the secondary

157
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:28,680
location um it's mixed with old uh horse

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,919
and cow manure and about I'll say 15% of

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,240
perite for better drainage got it and

160
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,240
then so that's what you're starting with

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,560
are you doing any sort of like top

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
dressing of amendments or anything like

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
that throughout the grow at all or is it

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,319
just kind of water only for the whole

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,720
grow cycle having the marsh soil it

166
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,720
already has a lot of life in it you

167
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,599
already have fish poop you got

168
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,720
everything else and then with the manure

169
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,680
it is high uh very rich in in nitrogen

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,039
so you have your nitrogens but I will

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,720
also sometimes use a slow release

172
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:09,519
pellets I'm not sure the brand and in

173
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,120
flour I'll add a potassium nitrate when

174
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,519
do you usually add the potassium nitrate

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,000
uh when they start flowering oh start

176
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,799
okay so the start of flowering I know

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,560
some people will wait until like mid or

178
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,919
late flowering you're doing it from the

179
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,160
start of flowering and then throughout

180
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,120
the whole flowering stage depending

181
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,439
again what the plant is telling me so

182
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
you're just looking for reading the

183
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,079
plant looking for deficiencies and then

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
kind of feeding according to that

185
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,959
exactly and then what are you using for

186
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,079
a water source are you using like a

187
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,079
local tap water well water are you

188
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:42,120
filtering your water so I actually use

189
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:45,680
two different kind of water I use well

190
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,079
water and I use uh collected rainwater

191
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,158
that we collected in a rain barrel so um

192
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,560
most of the time I'll if I use the hose

193
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,719
then it's it's well water and then if I

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,759
use the rain water I'll I'll do it by

195
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,479
hand got it now have you ever done a

196
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,319
water test on your well water to kind of

197
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,360
see what the balance of nutrients are in

198
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,560
there or you just kind of assuming that

199
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,720
everything is good and hoping that the

200
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,680
microbes kind of work things out just

201
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,039
assuming so far it's been working over

202
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,840
the years cool I figured I'd ask that

203
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,959
because I know some well waters are high

204
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,079
in um what is it I think it's iron I

205
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,638
believe so some people yeah some people

206
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,359
get into hot water because they're

207
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,840
adding this well water and then they

208
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
they're seeing problems with it and then

209
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,918
they're come to I out there's just an

210
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
excess of some elements in their well

211
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,038
water that's causing a lock out of other

212
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,918
elements so big I asked that just to see

213
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,679
if you had done testing or not how about

214
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,480
compost teas do you do those at all um

215
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,319
no uh not outdoors I do not again they

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,240
have a lot of stuff already in them from

217
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,120
the soil so already got that microbe

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,159
life indigenous microorganisms from the

219
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,679
the soil that you took from from that

220
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,958
area in the local so yeah that's pretty

221
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,159
cool it's local exactly yeah so let's

222
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,759
get into plant training next what do you

223
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,278
typically do for plant training when

224
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:11,838
growing Outdoors so considering where my

225
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,278
second location is there is no neighbors

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,600
I am not worried of smell I'm not

227
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:21,679
worried about uh the plants being seen

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,519
so all I do is absolutely nothing I let

229
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,239
them grow wild and free and how nature

230
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,919
intended them to so no bending no

231
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,560
topping no super cropping no f no

232
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:36,159
nothing huh just naturally Wild and Free

233
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,199
now when I looked at your Instagram one

234
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,199
thing I noticed is that I believe you do

235
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,800
have one steak in the middle there and

236
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,879
then there's a cup at the top of the

237
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,799
steak what's that all about um that's

238
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,519
just to know what which kind it

239
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,719
is okay so it's a label basically for

240
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,200
you yes yes the blue cups are uh clones

241
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,560
of one kind the red CL cups are clones

242
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,680
of the other and then the bigger pots

243
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,958
the seedling have actual like popsicle

244
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,319
sticks inside that you can't see okay

245
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,000
now do you ever get without doing the

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
training I'm I'm just curious do you

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,679
ever get plants that are so big that

248
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
we're just kind of flopping all over the

249
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,838
place towards the end of uh flowering

250
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,519
there it's kind of hard to manage or or

251
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,959
no yes but that's where the bamboo

252
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,600
sticks really come in handy tying them

253
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,359
up to keep uh keep them straight because

254
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,759
otherwise like you said they will start

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,560
to to flop so in flowering you are going

256
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,958
in and adding in support staks what is

257
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,799
it like mid or they flowering or

258
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,719
something like that just just as needed

259
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,919
or what it just as needed yes some

260
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,879
plants may not need it some plants May

261
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,879
got it that makes sense and so how big

262
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,240
do your outdoor plants typically get so

263
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,958
typically they'll get anywhere from

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,759
seven to feet uh 7 to 10 feet tall on a

265
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,919
good good harvest typically okay lots of

266
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,039
time trimming I assume right oh my

267
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,559
goodness that's a whole different show

268
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,879
yeah would not want to be in that trim

269
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,000
jail that's for

270
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,278
sure that's something I feel like that

271
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,159
like a bow trimmer would be super

272
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,200
helpful if you got the money even one of

273
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,679
those larger trimmers more

274
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,519
commercialized but they make up like

275
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,319
more commercialized ones for hom Growers

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,759
as well yeah I know they can get pretty

277
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,760
pricey there but jez if you're dealing

278
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,439
with with 10 foot plants and you've got

279
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
multiple of them worth the investment

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,320
now I want to get into something that's

281
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,720
going to potentially hurt yields which

282
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,399
is pests what is your IPM routine

283
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,920
consist of like what are you doing in

284
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,639
order to prevent pests from invading

285
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,120
your grow space I've been very lucky

286
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:44,959
knock on wood and I might regret saying

287
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,399
this but I do not do any IPM management

288
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,719
um Mother Nature has been good to me so

289
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,639
far and with the ladybugs we have out

290
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,278
there and with all the amazing life in

291
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,278
the marsh soil uh both good and bad it's

292
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,439
it's helped keep keep it pretty pretty

293
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,200
steady so no no major pest so far we've

294
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,399
had a couple caterpillars but you just

295
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,839
flick them off and it's been good

296
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,958
indoors however I've ran into uh a lot

297
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
of knots yeah that's great to hear about

298
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,479
Outdoors usually uh you know usually

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
hear about some infestations happening

300
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,519
but there are a lot of beneficials out

301
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,559
there that's really going to help combat

302
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,399
those pests exactly now caterpillars

303
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,719
have you been doing any sort of spraying

304
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,639
I know you said you you're flicking them

305
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,360
off by I know some people really

306
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,759
struggle with caterpillars it's just

307
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,919
it's all over the plant is is you just

308
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,799
find here one here and there or is it

309
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,599
like does it get really bad sometimes

310
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,359
again knock on wood I've been pretty

311
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,199
lucky where I do have uh the plants I do

312
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,039
keep them away from other trees and

313
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:52,439
other uh plant life that is in the area

314
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,319
so they don't have like caterpillars

315
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,000
falling on it and stuff like that so I'm

316
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm assuming that's why I haven't had

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,039
many or it could just be luck how about

318
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,319
beneficial insects do you have any of

319
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,639
those like kind of flying around or that

320
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,040
you can spot that you're aware of that

321
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,519
you know are doing a good thing in your

322
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:15,000
garden not that I could really think off

323
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,078
the top of my head like just the normal

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,720
like of course the ladybugs they're

325
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,958
they're our favorite uh our favorite

326
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,879
one but besides that I can't just think

327
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,119
right now okay how about cover crops and

328
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,039
mul layer and then you mention your

329
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,240
growing organically mentioned the inputs

330
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,519
and what you're using for a soil now

331
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,919
some people are going to do cover crops

332
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,039
as well which could be very beneficial

333
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,679
for a wide variety of reasons or mulch

334
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,039
layers are you doing utilizing either

335
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,759
one of those in your containers uh I am

336
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:51,439
not but it is something that I want to

337
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,958
start doing um I haven't yet again with

338
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,839
the soil I'm using it already has a lot

339
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,679
of those microbes a lot of bacterias a

340
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,560
lot of everything I need

341
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,679
which is great but I know covered crops

342
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,758
would be good for um pest controls as as

343
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,278
well for keeping certain pests away

344
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,519
certain smells will keep certain bugs

345
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,399
and so that is definitely something I'm

346
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,639
interested in my next gross but not this

347
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,799
one not yet all right well I'll

348
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,799
definitely be staying tuned to your

349
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,399
Instagram to see once you start using

350
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,758
those things how you use them because uh

351
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
yeah it's definitely definitely

352
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,199
beneficial I like to see what the

353
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,879
difference would be between using them

354
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,758
not using them that'd be cool yeah any

355
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,519
advice for the flowering stage I feel

356
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,278
like this is somewhere a lot of folks

357
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,879
they just struggle they have a really

358
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,879
healthy veg they veg their plants for

359
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,278
however long then flip the flower or in

360
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,439
Outdoors it's just automatically

361
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,480
transitioning the flower as there's less

362
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,320
light naturally right but in the

363
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,639
flowering stage people come across

364
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,720
problems potentially with deficiencies

365
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,799
or whatever what advice do you have for

366
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,680
getting through the flowering stage to

367
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,919
be honest the best advice I can give

368
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,758
is to just not give up um reach out to

369
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:09,559
the community don't be afraid to ask for

370
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:12,959
help be patient because that is my

371
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,559
biggest uh challenge in flowering is

372
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,838
being

373
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:21,000
patient um but yeah definitely uh if if

374
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,800
you don't succeed just don't give up

375
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,600
keep moving forward again ask for help

376
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,399
there's no shame in asking for help we

377
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,920
all started at the bottom and that's how

378
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,120
we will learn

379
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,240
what kind of deficiency we have what

380
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,000
kind of what kind of nutrients you may

381
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,399
need to add and so on and so forth good

382
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,039
tips I want to go back to the Harvest

383
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,078
process cuz you know you mentioned these

384
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,480
7 to 10 foot plants and it's a lot can

385
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,519
you walk us through your process of

386
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,159
harvesting like when do you harvest what

387
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,120
are you looking at to determine when or

388
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,439
not to harvest and then walk us through

389
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,278
your process in detail like cutting down

390
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,759
the Plant and what you do from there so

391
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,799
ideally

392
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,560
I would like to cut down I like to cut

393
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,439
down uh Thanksgiving Canadian

394
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,239
Thanksgiving which is in

395
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,759
October um I do like to check my

396
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,399
tricomes I'm looking for something

397
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,360
that's no clear I don't want any clear

398
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,639
on my

399
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,199
tricomes but um due to our weather which

400
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:28,240
is very up and down it's very hard to um

401
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:31,958
get that far so um we do get a lot of

402
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,039
rain a lot of frost cuz I am up North so

403
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:39,879
we tend to get a lot of uh Bud rot which

404
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,958
causes us to cut down very very early do

405
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,480
you typically just cut off that Branch

406
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,159
that's infected or are you like getting

407
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,720
rid of the whole plant well if it's not

408
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,360
bad we'll cut off the plant that's the

409
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,440
just the branch that's infected but once

410
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,639
we notice that it starts to spread I

411
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,360
will cut the whole plant and then cut

412
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,759
out the pieces that have been

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,519
um that have Bud rot and just hang it

414
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,679
and go from there so once I do cut them

415
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,599
um I will hang them usually the whole

416
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:15,360
plant would be hung in a garage in the

417
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,798
top Loft on strings so in the garage on

418
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,558
strings hanging upside down and then for

419
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,439
drying what does your setup look like

420
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,199
are you just in that area and then also

421
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,000
are you setting up like humidifiers or

422
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,160
dehumidifiers fans like what's your Dy

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,038
set up for drying I do look for

424
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,640
6060 um it is much cooler in October

425
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:44,279
especially up north again so I do not

426
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:47,080
need to have any um extra humidifiers or

427
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,079
air conditioners or fan knock on wood

428
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:53,879
it's I've been pretty lucky

429
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:58,000
for between the 55 60 is what I I've

430
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,960
been getting but ideally I aim for 6060

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,519
it must be nice to have that natural

432
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,240
humidity there I live in a dry climate I

433
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,038
have to say that in almost every episode

434
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,519
here because uh people need to be

435
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:11,119
reminded every

436
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:14,599
episod but it's 20 to 30% I mean I had

437
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,719
winter time it was 16% relative humidity

438
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:20,000
and so I'm always trying to crank in

439
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,798
humidity it is not fun yeah and in

440
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,519
drying it's so easy to over dry and I

441
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,558
can only imagine being a place like you

442
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:30,119
where it's just it's naturally around

443
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:33,240
that 55 60% yeah relative humidity which

444
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,279
is ideal for the drying process so I'm a

445
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,759
little bit

446
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,000
jealous I will notice that like if it

447
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:43,599
does rain a lot the humidity it is very

448
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,079
humid so I will put a a dehumidifier but

449
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,439
it it's very rare thankfully better safe

450
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,000
to deploy that out and uh try to start

451
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,759
removing that humidity rather than come

452
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
across that bud Rod right because that

453
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,759
that mold can even happen in the drying

454
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,320
stage and yes that happened to me

455
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,798
unfortunately I uh I went through a grow

456
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,119
my fan died within the last couple weeks

457
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,599
and I noticed it after 24 hours so the

458
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,119
fan died I looked at I'm like oh what

459
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,319
the heck the fan died so I added in the

460
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,479
fan let the plants continue to grow for

461
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,558
those past two for the last two weeks

462
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,919
yeah harvested and then it's during

463
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,599
drying when I noticed that I actually

464
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,120
had an issue there was white Buzzy mold

465
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,879
on the inside of the buds I'm like oh no

466
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,599
what happened I had to think was it my

467
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,679
drying conditions no it actually wasn't

468
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,519
I had to think back and be oh I had a

469
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,559
fan die for 24 hours and sure the fan

470
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,798
died and was only down for 24 hours but

471
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,440
that's enough time for that to establish

472
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,558
and start the Bas to start to grow right

473
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,759
and so like even though I add it in fans

474
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,200
that doesn't eliminate the problem right

475
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,879
that the the the mold has already

476
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,400
started and it would slowly grow Grew

477
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,520
From there so Bud Rod is definitely not

478
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,720
a fun thing to come across that's for

479
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,960
sure oh no especially when it's baked

480
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,319
plants it's sad when you have to cut

481
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,798
them down to early and they don't

482
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,158
they're still good but they don't get to

483
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,480
the full potential they can be I can

484
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,640
only imagine I can only imagine so after

485
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,960
you're done drying the plant so it's

486
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,400
brought down to that kind of shelf

487
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,558
stable percent what are you doing for

488
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,679
curing are you putting into jars or

489
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:21,798
using bags what go through your curing

490
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:26,080
process so for curing um I do both I do

491
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:29,158
the jars and I do the Grove bags um the

492
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:33,000
reason I do that is because again having

493
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:37,000
so many so much to harvest um I only

494
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,919
have so many bags so I go to the jars I

495
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,519
do the rest of the jars and I do like to

496
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,120
see the side by side difference I didn't

497
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:48,359
notice much the only thing with for

498
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,719
myself personally with jars is I tend to

499
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,959
forget to burp or I forget to tend to

500
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,279
put the jar lid back on so with the

501
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,880
curing bag I don't have to worry about

502
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,678
it I'll open it once in a blue moon move

503
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,400
the buds around to make sure that

504
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,880
everything's good and and then just

505
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,120
leave it yeah so those Grove bags you

506
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,360
don't even need to burp at all

507
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,599
technically right it's kind of like a

508
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,918
self burping thing you just as long as

509
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,558
the buds are dry once you're putting it

510
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,720
in there and sealing it up now you also

511
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:22,359
like heat sealing it as well no uh it is

512
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Rec recommended to uh heat seal but but

513
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,000
I do

514
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,240
not but even when you're sealing it it's

515
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,079
it's burping itself so you don't have to

516
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,960
uh actually open up a jar every day so

517
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,839
that makes things a little bit easier I

518
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,319
like to move it around just to make sure

519
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,079
there's no no more moisture I just just

520
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,759
to make sure because sometimes you think

521
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,119
it's dry and it's not 100% you get that

522
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,879
moisture in the bags and so I like to

523
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,079
check on it definitely sounds like a

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,240
good thing to do now are you using the

525
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,960
large Grill bags that hold like a pound

526
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,599
at a time or whatever I got to imagine

527
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,679
using the larger ones since you're

528
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,240
having such a big yield out there right

529
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:04,000
yes so I do have a lot of uh larger bags

530
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,278
I do have some medium bags but uh yeah I

531
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,558
I tend to stti stick definitely with the

532
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:14,558
larger bags how long until you actually

533
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:18,639
consume um ideally I want it to be a

534
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:21,158
month or two for curing but that all

535
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,200
depends on how well I did on my previous

536
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,679
Harvest if I need to uh get into it

537
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,519
earlier or not okay and then did you

538
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,320
mention trying to remember if you

539
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,679
mentioned what you usually get for yield

540
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,119
when growing up to ideally what I'm

541
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,679
looking for and what I normally get is

542
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,759
anywhere between a pound per plant a

543
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:44,320
pound a pound and a half per plant it

544
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,558
all of course that all that all depends

545
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,000
on the feno as well is there any

546
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,480
particular strains that you recommend

547
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,759
being so new to Growing I haven't tried

548
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,720
many St strains yet so I can't really uh

549
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:03,278
recommend

550
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:07,079
I do like to grow um Outlaw seeds that

551
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:10,720
has been one of my favorite braiders um

552
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:13,199
I do like like the Forbidden fruits um

553
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,798
the Mery Berry they're I really like

554
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,558
that gassy fruity turp is what I like to

555
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,918
grow yeah I like the gassy fruity

556
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:25,240
citrusy I like that more than like the

557
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,480
dessert super sweet but everyone has

558
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,798
their own preferences they're real

559
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,880
skunky gassy fuy like I love that that's

560
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,599
that's that's all me for

561
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,840
sure so misconceptions I want to ask you

562
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,918
this question here there's a lot of

563
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,240
misconceptions when it comes to Growing

564
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
Outdoors can you give us uh maybe a

565
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
short list of things that people think

566
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,120
of the case when it's when growing

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,919
Outdoors but it's actually not the case

568
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:51,278
so growing

569
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,840
Outdoors um again people think it's it's

570
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:57,000
very easy but it it again it's not the

571
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,798
case weather has a big factor to do with

572
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,278
it so um always have a backup

573
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,000
plan for bad weather so if you know it's

574
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,359
going to rain have tarps ready if you

575
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,558
know it's going to be windy get ready to

576
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:15,038
tie them down uh because that kind of

577
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:17,240
stuff can definitely ruin a good uh

578
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,919
plant all right and then do you have any

579
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,200
advice for beginners that are just

580
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,960
getting started growing Outdoors so I

581
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,480
definitely um never give up like I said

582
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,399
previously is one of my big things um

583
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,839
learn from your Stakes again don't be

584
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:36,359
afraid to ask for help um and when you

585
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,359
do ask for help you always got to keep

586
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,000
in mind that everyone's environment is

587
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,719
different so their advice might work

588
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,759
great for them but it might not work

589
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,120
great for you and that's okay just keep

590
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:53,879
looking until you find what works great

591
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:57,079
for you and till you dial in um your

592
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,520
craft but yeah definitely never give up

593
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,439
and be patient that's my biggest don't

594
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,599
cut too early yeah it can be kind of

595
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,240
difficult when you're so excited you're

596
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,639
like oh is I ready to harvest ready to

597
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,640
go and then cting too early that's a

598
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,200
common mistake yes that is my biggest

599
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,520
fault so you have a pretty simple

600
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,080
straightforward approach to Growing

601
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,398
Outdoors now I know you mentioned that

602
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,798
you've been growing Outdoors for a

603
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:24,678
couple years now so arguably you're in

604
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:27,558
the the kind of newer stages of growing

605
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,200
Outdoors but you keep it very simple

606
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:31,678
right using the soil that is at your

607
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,720
local Marsh from down the street or

608
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,640
wherever using inputs manure based

609
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,079
inputs locally right you're growing

610
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,679
Outdoors you don't have to worry about

611
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,119
lights lights on or off or any

612
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,080
controlling the environment conditions

613
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,519
because that's all done naturally

614
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:50,480
outdoors you haven't come across many

615
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,119
pests fortunate enough for that right so

616
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,120
not using any cover crops or mulch

617
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:56,599
layers just keeping it simple all around

618
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,079
and you're getting all the way to

619
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,199
harvest I think this is a good example

620
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,240
of a way that you can keep it simple and

621
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
get to harvest a lot of folks will do

622
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,640
the process and they'll overthink things

623
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,759
or they'll complicate things and they're

624
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,520
getting the same result that you're

625
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,759
getting and they're doing a lot more

626
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,879
work so yes I think that comes with

627
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:20,240
being um again a new grower is I haven't

628
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,039
gotten to over complicate things yet and

629
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,079
I'm trying very hard not to I'm trying

630
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:29,278
to stick to if it's working stick to

631
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,960
that what works works

632
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,398
what you don't know you don't know and

633
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,480
just doing things trying it out and and

634
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:38,599
having fun with it yeah awesome well
