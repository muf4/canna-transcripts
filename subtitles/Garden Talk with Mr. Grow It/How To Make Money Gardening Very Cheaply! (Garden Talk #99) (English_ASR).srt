1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,278
coming up on Garden talk my soil is the

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,778
most important thing to me if I don't

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,859
have good solo I don't have good crops

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,960
so I treat my soil extremely well and

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,000
try to help it be as nutritious as

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,519
possible my tomato plant roots will feed

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
on the microbes from the cover crop

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,879
plantings are still the roots are still

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,198
on the ground they may be dead but

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,660
there's there's still life down there

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,300
eating and surviving and helping each

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,939
other out so I'm a huge huge cover crop

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,500
fan I'm building my soil legitimately

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,119
every single year because I'm adding

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,920
more castings more sort of cover

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,079
cropping like it just gets better and

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,660
the yields go up and I mean we know our

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,640
mechanic we know our doctor we know the

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,279
got Footlocker that sells our shoes by

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,659
name but we don't know who put who grows

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,399

we're going to dive into the details of

83
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,080
your garden and how you go about making

84
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,459
money from it but first let's do an

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,900
introduction can you tell us a little

86
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,219
bit about yourself and how you got into

87
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,659
gardening

88
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,139
yeah

89
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,780
um I own Dallas half acre Farm it's a uh

90
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,039
a little less than a half acre a piece

91
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,620
of property right outside of Dallas

92
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,179
Texas I don't live on the property it's

93
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,519
just strictly by farm and where I raise

94
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,980
a few chickens and quail and you know

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,860
it's a miniature farm is what I call it

96
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,840
just a farm scaled down to a half acre

97
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,000
and I've been doing it seven years

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,900
starting in January will be my seventh

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,658
year and I grow seasonal vegetables for

100
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,239
uh families and people in my

101
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,979
neighborhood and at businesses and that

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,299
I know you know anyone that wants to buy

103
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,399
buy them I'll sell them to them I don't

104
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,200
do farmers markets

105
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,620
um it's directly I don't do restaurants

106
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,539
or grocery stores it's directly to the

107
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,519
families and the people that that I know

108
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,639
that want to buy

109
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,860
um so seasonal vegetables is like right

110
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,139
now going into the fall here in Dallas

111
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,060
winter it's a

112
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:10,559
salad mix kale carrots uh small onions

113
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,199
um you know about the size of a quarter

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,580
or a golf ball and a lot of people eat

115
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,798
them for the greens instead of the

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,600
actual onions so

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,120
um then I've got a little bit of

118
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,979
cilantro left and just anything that you

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,160
think of during the winter I grow that

120
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:29,339
and then come spring I move into uh

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,560
salads I grow salad year round here in

122
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,138
Texas so I can do that pretty easily and

123
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,600
then I do tomatoes peppers

124
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,460
you know a little bit of cantaloupe if I

125
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,820
have the space just stuff that you think

126
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,439
of in a seasonal Garden I just make it a

127
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,659
little bit bigger and then I'm able to

128
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,459
sell it okay pretty straightforward and

129
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,000
so you have different plants that you go

130
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,799
for different times of the year yep yep

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,240
it's all seasonal

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,919
um like I don't grow carrots in the

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,139
middle of the summer because it's it's

134
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,459
they don't taste as good

135
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,259
um I don't grow tomatoes during the

136
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,120
winter because obviously the frost and

137
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,280
the freeze here in Texas kills them so

138
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,620
it's just basic what you would think of

139
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,179
a backyard garden except there's a few

140
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,139
techniques I do to increase my yield

141
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,800
and

142
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,860
um

143
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,960
overall profitability so I imagine the

144
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,540
folks that are looking to do this as

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,638
well determining a place to grow the

146
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,620
plants how do you determine if the space

147
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,038
you are looking to plant in receives

148
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,478
enough sunlight uh it's just observation

149
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,279
um but I picked that when I picked my

150
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,139
property that I bought now I went out

151
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,299
there four or five times just to see

152
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,280
where the sun was at different times of

153
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,840
the day

154
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,659
obviously here in Texas you know the

155
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,698
summers are brutal it's 110 for weeks

156
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,100
you know between 100 110 for four to

157
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,538
five six weeks on end so

158
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,820
in my context I want uh Evening Shade so

159
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:55,199
if I can get that morning sun up to

160
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,060
three or four o'clock and then I've got

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,978
a nice tree line or something off to the

162
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,019
to the west to give me some Shade that's

163
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,418
perfect but yeah you are correct you

164
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,120
need as much sunlight as possible for

165
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,740
the growth but depending on your area

166
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,780
you know if I'm in

167
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,519
Minnesota I don't really care if I'm

168
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,439
have a West shade or not because it

169
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,538
doesn't get that hot there I just want

170
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,660
maximum sunlight so you got to take in

171
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:21,180
the contexture your temperature

172
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,620
and your amount of sunlight got it talk

173
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,199
to us a little bit deeper about your

174
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,120
half acre that you're gardening on I

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,340
believe you're growing all in beds

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,699
correct me from on there and then what

177
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,258
plants do you have kind of growing where

178
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,560
so aggro

179
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,500
um I grow actually growing 330 foot long

180
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,478
14 foot wide caterpillar tunnels

181
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,319
um they're seven foot six in the middle

182
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,839
and they're shaped like a tunnel and

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,479
they're they're made out of poles that

184
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,698
are bent into a tunnel shape every five

185
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,038
feet and it's got eight mil plastic on

186
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,740
it and during the winter I can close

187
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,180
everything down and hold in that heat

188
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,160
um during the summer I can raise the

189
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,840
plastic up a good five or six feet on

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,939
the side and then take the end walls

191
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,099
down so I've got good airflow going

192
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:12,120
every which direction

193
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,000
so that allows me to plant

194
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,759
summer crops earlier because in Texas we

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,759
usually get a frost around Easter

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,199
well I plant my tomatoes spring break so

197
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,120
I plant them three or four weeks earlier

198
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,379
than what I could is if I didn't have my

199
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,379
tunnels

200
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,719
and then in the fall I just lost all my

201
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,360
tomato plants last week because it got

202
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,639
down to the low 30s you know for five or

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,560
six hours a night four nights in a row

204
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,759
and it just shocked them whereas last

205
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,918
year

206
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,439
I had tomatoes selling at Christmas

207
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,079
because we never got that cold

208
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,819
so some years I could have them for a

209
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,978
long time some years like this year it

210
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,400
was just kind of a free deal with with

211
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,899
getting that cold snap real early but it

212
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,179
does you know growing in the tunnels

213
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,279
helped tremendously it also protects

214
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,680
them from the rain which you think

215
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,538
you know plants don't need protection

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,879
from the rain but when you're growing

217
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,000
lettuce and even Tomatoes what happens

218
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,639
is in the summer here in Texas you'll

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,560
get a thunderstorm and it'll rain a

220
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,199
quarter of an inch and an hour later

221
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,660
it's 105 again and the humidity is 95

222
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,598
and it's pure hell on Earth

223
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,199
and those leaves on that lettuce are wet

224
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:27,000
and it's 95 degrees you get a fungus

225
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,879
and you lose everything

226
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,800
whereas grow underneath my tunnels that

227
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,200
plastic protects it they don't get wet

228
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,620
everything stays dry

229
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,658
and so it helps Regard in regards to

230
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,399
that quite a bit so

231
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,019
now that you understand the context of

232
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,019
the tunnels

233
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,958
um yes I grow in raised beds about six

234
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:52,679
to eight inches tall because my soil is

235
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:55,559
so bad it's literally clay it's like

236
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,879
concrete during the summer and swamp

237
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,000
during the fall in the winter because

238
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:04,559
it's so wet so I just bought

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,339
a bunch of one by six uh Cedar boards

240
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:11,518
and made beds that are three foot wide

241
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,140
and 50 foot long inside my tunnels and

242
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,940
gave me a little walkway every 50 foot

243
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,720
to get in and out of the tunnels

244
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,580
and fill them up with compost and my uh

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
amendments that I put in there depending

246
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:27,420
on what exact plant I'm putting in there

247
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,439
with them and off the go I don't till I

248
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,958
don't know if you've ever heard of the

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,420
phrase no-till so I'm like no-till I

250
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,919
never till my soil

251
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:37,979
it helps with the fertility and in Texas

252
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:41,278
it gets so dry it helps retain moisture

253
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,740
so that helps a ton and

254
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,958
um it's just easier my soul never gets

255
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,000
compacted I don't walk on my beds so

256
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,359
they never get compacted

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,580
um my bands are three foot wide so I

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,139
don't have to walk on my beds to harvest

259
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,980
anything I can get everything from one

260
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,600
side

261
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,920
and then I can walk around and do

262
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,899
everything on the other side and reach

263
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,000
to the middle when I go from both sides

264
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,220
so my soil

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,139
my soil is the most important thing to

266
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,100
me if I don't have good soil I don't

267
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:13,379
have good crops so I treat my soil

268
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,540
extremely well and try to help it be as

269
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,278
nutritious as possible I definitely want

270
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,319
to get deeper into this soil and how you

271
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,820
do the amending and so on and so forth

272
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,820
but I do want to ask about the tunnels

273
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,278
first specifically how much does it cost

274
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,019
to build out those tunnels there's a

275
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,360
company there's several companies

276
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,000
there's uh two main companies that you

277
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,060
can get them from one is Farmer's friend

278
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,759
and it says farmers friendlc.com and

279
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,859
then there's another uh company called

280
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,740
bootstrap farmer and they both sell to

281
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,320
small-scale Farmers like about me and

282
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,060
they just send you the kit you put it

283
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,740
together they got a 10 minute video both

284
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,179
of them have 10 minute videos on how to

285
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,100
do it

286
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,139
um they're really easy to put together I

287
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,540
can put one up in about four hours by

288
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,159
myself I don't recommend it but

289
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,799
most of the that I do I have to do

290
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,199
by myself so

291
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,059
um it is possible and I'll be honest

292
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,680
with you I haven't got a quote on a

293
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,379
tunnel in a couple years because I don't

294
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,958
need any more but I think I'm 50 Footers

295
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,720
around twelve hundred dollars

296
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,979
so it's not going to break the bank but

297
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,839
it's definitely something you should be

298
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,420
serious about before you go spend the

299
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,519
money but they do last an extremely long

300
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,379
time like I've had the same plastic now

301
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
going on Seven Seasons

302
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,838
I'll probably have to replace it after

303
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,060
this season but it's paid for itself

304
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,279
very very easily yeah it sounds like it

305
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,559
can be extremely valuable and pretty

306
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,899
much needed for somebody like you where

307
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,379
you have those swings in the environment

308
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,839
like you mentioned yeah absolutely

309
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,778
um I that's a everyone that I talked to

310
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,339
about this I ask them are you serious or

311
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,659
you just want to try it and if they say

312
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,160
I just want to try it out I said okay

313
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,259
wait till spring

314
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,480
you know try it for three or four months

315
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,519
and then if you love it spend the money

316
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,740
and buy you a tunnel but if you're dead

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,740
serious right now spend your money on a

318
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,539
tunnel first and then you know buy the

319
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,459
other stuff that you think you need

320
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,319
because you just can't grow year round

321
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,299
without the tunnels and if you're trying

322
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
to make money doing this you can't take

323
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,319
off four months out of the year and not

324
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,899
grow anything that makes sense so

325
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,879
preparing the soil for planting a lot of

326
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,278
people will amend the soil with

327
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,639
fertilizer to begin I know you mentioned

328
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,078
your organic no-till what do you do to

329
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,259
the soil in order to prepare for

330
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,778
planting so first thing I take into

331
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,019
account is what am I planting if I'm

332
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:38,519
planting tomatoes in this three foot

333
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,299
wide bed

334
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,039
um

335
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,659
I'm going to put in

336
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,699
different amendments that I'm going to

337
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,799
do if I'm going to put in lettuce so if

338
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,839
I grow a lot of salad mix on my farm so

339
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,359
if I'm just doing salad mix the most

340
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,339
important thing is nitrogen and the

341
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,879
organic forms of nitrogen that I prefer

342
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,860
to use on that farm is soybean meal

343
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,899
you can get a box of it for 20 bucks I

344
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,820
think there's five pounds in it and a

345
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,159
box lasts me

346
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,839
got four or five months so I mean that

347
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,519
amendment's really cheap and I just

348
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,139
literally just sprinkle it all over the

349
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,459
bed before I plant and then kind of rake

350
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,159
it into the soil

351
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,919
so that's a big one but the most

352
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,838
important amendment that I use is worm

353
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,120
castings and for those of you that don't

354
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,540
know what worm castings are they're warm

355
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,399
this warm poop and it sounds gross

356
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,500
but it's not

357
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,139
um there's a guy down in plantersville

358
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,700
Texas down by Houston and he's pretty

359
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,680
much the smartest man alive when it

360
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,320
comes to worm castings like we all have

361
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,059
our own Hobby and his Hobbies worms and

362
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,220
making the most nutritious worm castings

363
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,119
there is in in the world like he has

364
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,639
other

365
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,899
worm castings tested he'll bind with his

366
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,459
own money test them just to make sure

367
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,419
his are still higher grade than everyone

368
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,838
else's

369
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,278
and he he loves it he's a wealth of

370
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
knowledge and I buy a thousand pounds

371
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,458
from him twice a year

372
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,319
and

373
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,399
what I do is usually a five gallon

374
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
bucket

375
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,860
every 15 feet

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,240
so like uh on a 50-foot bed I'll put

377
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,600
three three and a half five gallon

378
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,820
buckets which is about I don't know 60

379
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,159
70 pounds worth of worm casting into

380
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,899
that bed and then just rake it in like I

381
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,159
do the soybean mail

382
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:22,200
so the worm castings if you're anywhere

383
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,078
close to Houston like Louisiana Oklahoma

384
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,720
Arkansas to Mexico is worth the drive

385
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,458
down there you buy a thousand pound bag

386
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,019
big old tote sack he puts it in the back

387
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,879
of your truck with a

388
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,139
with a tractor and you drive off with it

389
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,778
and you go home and unload it however

390
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,600
you want to unload it but they're by far

391
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:42,720
the best I've actually done accidental

392
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,480
tests without fat tomatoes

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,100
um I dig a hole of course and then I put

394
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,620
worm castings and some organic

395
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,639
fertilizer in there and uh sometimes I

396
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,578
forget

397
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,680
to put the worm castings in the hole

398
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,319
well two weeks later I can go back and I

399
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,578
can see I didn't put worm castings

400
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,740
in that one because that tomato plant's

401
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,019
two two feet shorter than all my other

402
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,180
tomato plants I mean there's a massive

403
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,919
difference and it's all because of the

404
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,179
quality and I've done every test that I

405
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,899
can do

406
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,739
by myself just to try it out and every

407
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,679
time

408
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,079
they proved to be the best and I really

409
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,179
can't talk about them enough yeah I use

410
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,278
worm cars things in my garden for my

411
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,078
medicinal plants and makes a huge

412
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,519
difference definitely makes a huge

413
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:27,899
difference it's got the microbes on

414
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,120
there as well which will help break down

415
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,759
any other organic matter that you add

416
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,740
into the medium so yeah can't speak

417
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,360
enough about worm castings that's for

418
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,060
sure now are you starting these plants

419
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,620
indoors and then letting them grow for a

420
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,659
little while maybe under a grow light

421
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,759
and then transferring them to your

422
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:48,480
outdoor Garden or you just planting

423
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,939
directly into your outdoor beds no I uh

424
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,620
I start indoors I have a tub shed in my

425
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,660
backyard because my wife

426
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,799
um was getting really pissed because I

427
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,198
have so many lettuce plants and

428
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,359
everything growing in my house so I

429
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:04,019
splurged and bought me a 10 by 10 Tough

430
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,560
Shed and insulated it and I've got a six

431
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:10,139
four foot wide six foot tall grow racks

432
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,319
from Lowe's that has some LED lights

433
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,480
that I start everything from indoors I

434
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,000
mean obviously root crops carrots beets

435
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,980
radishes though those get started direct

436
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,198
seeded

437
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,720
but most everything else is transplanted

438
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,039
lettuce tomatoes

439
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,778
you know some of the grains like red

440
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,719
Russian Kerala charred I'll just direct

441
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:33,539
so into the ground but probably 75

442
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,879
percent of my farm is uh started in my

443
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:38,278
Tough Shed or my backyard and then

444
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,458
you know depending on the date how many

445
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,919
days it is since I planted them I uh

446
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,958
transplant them into my farm I was going

447
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,719
to ask what how long did you let them

448
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,039
grow indoors before you transplant

449
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,740
Outdoors

450
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,958
um it switches back it depends on the

451
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,698
plant you know obviously Tomatoes I

452
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,099
usually start you know around Christmas

453
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:01,500
and I'll transplant March 1st because I

454
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,259
like really big tomato plants

455
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,578
um so you know that's a good 12 weeks

456
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:09,240
whereas lettuce is 21 to 24 days

457
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,938
um

458
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,939
so it just depends on the crop like I

459
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,120
said salad is usually 21 to 24 days

460
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,640
maybe 26 but anything over 26 tends to

461
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,318
get too big and when I transplant it it

462
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,059
goes into kind of a shock and I lose the

463
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,918
bigger leaves anyway so I actually lose

464
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,798
Time by letting the plants get bigger

465
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,440
got it now when you do plant them into

466
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,418
your outdoor Garden forgot to ask are

467
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,860
you using any cover crops like some

468
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,980
folks will use cover crops and grow

469
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:41,579
along with their plants or some folks

470
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,319
will do cover crops between grows do you

471
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:47,519
do any of that at all or no

472
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:49,139
oh yeah yeah I'm a huge cover crop fan

473
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,720
um I don't know if you've heard of Gabe

474
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,240
brown but he's a regenerative farmer up

475
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,538
in North Dakota or South Dakota and he's

476
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,579
got five principals for soil health and

477
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,440
I follow all five of those you know

478
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,099
religiously

479
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,900
um

480
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,759
just to try to increase my soil and

481
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,640
cover crop is

482
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:12,000
you know so does two of the five things

483
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,759
it always has a root in the ground so

484
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,740
during the winter like in my tomato I

485
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,779
caught my tomato tunnel that's where I

486
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,099
grow most of my tomatoes right now it's

487
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:25,740
covered in a 13 seeded winter

488
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:29,038
uh grass cover crop it's about three

489
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,620
four inches high now and then in the

490
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,900
spring around the end of February March

491
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,699
1st I'll uh

492
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:42,780
I'll tarp it kill it real good and then

493
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,759
I'll pull the that dead grass back dig a

494
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,899
hole plant my tomato plants right into

495
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,759
the

496
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,740
to the dead cover crop and that cover

497
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,279
crop acts as a mulch

498
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,220
for uh my tomatoes all summer which

499
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,839
helps with retained moisture you know my

500
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,779
tomato plant roots will feed on the

501
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,099
microbes from the cover crop plantings

502
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,418
are still the roots are still in the

503
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,339
ground they may be dead but there's

504
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,100
there's still life down there eating and

505
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:11,399
surviving and helping each other out

506
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:14,399
so I'm a huge huge cover crop fan most

507
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,038
layers do you use any of those

508
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,919
um yeah so I can't use cover crops on my

509
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,259
lettuce beds because

510
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,600
the cover crop tends to not die

511
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,919
perfectly so when I go to harvest

512
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,379
lettuce I've got

513
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,179
you know wheat grass or hairy veg

514
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,000
whatever my cover crop was grown inside

515
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,380
my lettuce and it makes it so tedious to

516
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,259
sit there and pick out every little

517
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,900
thing so instead of doing using a cover

518
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,900
crop on my uh

519
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,940
let us Bears I use wood chips there's a

520
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,280
there's a place two miles from my farm

521
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,860
that sells a pickup load for 10 bucks

522
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,178
so I go down there quite often and get

523
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,119
wood chips and

524
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,500
put them everywhere so how much mulch of

525
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,599
wood chip especially during the summer

526
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,279
because it just keeps the ground cooler

527
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,219
and moisture retention and all of that

528
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,720
there's so many benefits to mulching so

529
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,298
it sounds like you're getting everything

530
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,519
just about locally huh everything is

531
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,798
local except the worm castings but yeah

532
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,079
everything else is is local and

533
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,379
I mean it's my compost is three miles

534
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:19,139
away wood chips is two miles away my

535
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,660
house is four miles away so I mean it's

536
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,820
pretty easy that's the way to do it so

537
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,320
you've started your plants indoors

538
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,359
you've grown them to a certain point you

539
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,819
transfer them to your outdoor beds that

540
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,459
are amended with the fertilizer that it

541
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,079
needs for that particular type of plant

542
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,240
as the plant's growing what type of

543
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,159
organic inputs are you adding in

544
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,460
throughout the grow and when do you add

545
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,220
them so lettuce I don't the grains I

546
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,380
don't add anything after I because they

547
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,259
grow so fast like I'll transplant them

548
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,880
in at 24 25 days and during the spring

549
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,200
fall and summer when the days are a

550
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,020
little bit longer you get more sunlight

551
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,400
I'll Harvest that day 50. so they're

552
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,679
literally in the ground three to four

553
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,059
weeks before I harvest them so lettuce

554
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,100
isn't a big deal

555
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,798
dear uh the other plants the fruit

556
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,199
bearing plants tomatoes peppers zucchini

557
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,538
stuff like that I found this stuff at my

558
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,980
local Nursery here and they get it from

559
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:14,160
somewhere I don't know they don't make

560
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,200
it but it's got like that guano molasses

561
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,640
I mean there's a list of like 20

562
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,919
different things that are completely

563
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,860
organic that they figured out some

564
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,140
combination to put together and it comes

565
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:28,379
in a gallon jug and then you dilute

566
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,500
dilute that into a spray bottle

567
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,380
and about once every two to three weeks

568
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,140
also I'll spend a few hours and go

569
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,360
through seven or eight gallons of

570
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,720
my after I diluted seven or eight

571
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:45,058
gallons maybe a half a jug and and water

572
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,100
you know deep water that stuff into the

573
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:48,240
ground and you can tell three to four

574
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,339
days later

575
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,620
there's more blooms they're healthier

576
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,178
they're Greener they're darker

577
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,158
um if they're really struggling I'll do

578
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,320
it once a week and then maybe back off

579
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,940
to every two to three weeks yeah I just

580
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,798
go about observation

581
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,200
but that is a great amendment to have

582
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,839
I'm really lucky to have found it it is

583
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,058
25 for a gallon and I would probably use

584
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,678
three gallons for the whole year you

585
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:12,480
mentioned watering I want to ask you

586
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,000
about that next how do you go about

587
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,000
watering I mean you have such a huge

588
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,798
area that you have a garden on what's

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,339
your watering routine

590
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:26,158
uh that's drip tape everything's on drip

591
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,538
deep uh drip tape from drip Depot comes

592
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,700
with a kit

593
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:34,558
um so what I I have you know 14 foot

594
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:37,440
wide tunnels so I have uh a 15 foot I

595
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,240
call it the main hose a 15 foot strip of

596
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,080
main hose that goes across the length of

597
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,019
the bed

598
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:46,139
that has a water hose hook up to it

599
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,359
and each bed depending on what I grow

600
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,159
like lettuce I can get four rows of

601
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,339
lettuce and a three foot bed

602
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,679
so I've got four drip lines that the

603
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,899
lettuce is planted right next to every

604
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,519
dripping meter which is

605
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,019
um eight inches apart

606
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,579
so

607
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,038
if there's a jumping meter there's a

608
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:07,220
lettuce plant right next to it and at

609
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,019
the end of the hose out of the main hose

610
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,360
where the drip tape connects

611
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:14,639
has a I don't know what you want to call

612
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:19,678
it a faucet nozzle that you can turn

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,059
that specific line off or on so if I

614
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,679
decide to grow something that's not

615
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,899
every eight inches or I don't have four

616
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,600
beds I just turn that drip line off

617
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,120
and turn the drip line on if I'm growing

618
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,879
tomatoes per se I don't need four lines

619
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,759
of water if I've got one row of tomatoes

620
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,620
and it's it's all on drip I mean it's

621
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,298
you just turn it on and the biggest

622
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,579
thing is observation knowing when to

623
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:44,158
water and when not to water and you know

624
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:46,918
how long the water and you know other

625
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,780
than just observation you just turn it

626
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,059
on you must be saving a ton of labor

627
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,038
hours by having that automated watering

628
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:54,658
system there I imagine some people are

629
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,400
listening to this and they're like wow

630
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,440
it's a massive space he must be spending

631
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,120
all day long in your garden just

632
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,919
managing your plants whether it be

633
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,019
feeding or watering or so on and so

634
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,759
forth how often do you spend in your

635
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,599
garden each day

636
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,220
um

637
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,439
four hours

638
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,298
four to five hours now I could spend

639
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,558
more but I have a family

640
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:16,500
um and I don't think I even told you

641
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:20,819
this I'm actually a full-time teacher

642
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,940
um I found this farming thing seven

643
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:25,259
years ago and I didn't know how it was

644
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,058
gonna go I was like you know what I'm

645
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:28,379
gonna try it fell in love with it I

646
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,658
actually figured out I'm pretty good at

647
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,159
it and it makes pretty good money but

648
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,980
now I'm too close to retirement from

649
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,360
teaching so the way teachers work in

650
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,240
Texas you work

651
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,740
24 25 years and then you get a

652
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,839
percentage of your salary for the rest

653
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,359
of your life for retirement

654
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,819
so I'm like literally eight years away

655
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,918
and then I get three thousand dollars a

656
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:53,519
month for the rest of my life so I'm not

657
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,220
gonna you know leave doing that when I'm

658
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,839
this close so I actually Farm part-time

659
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,460
I tell everybody I'm a full-time farmer

660
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,079
and a part-time teacher because that's

661
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,179
the way I feel because I do so much

662
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,519
stuff at the farm and that I should do

663
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,340
so much stuff at school for my farm like

664
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,319
during lunch I'm planting seed trays on

665
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,418
my conference period I'm on the phone

666
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,839
talking to people or scheduling pickups

667
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,940
or deliveries or you know whatever so I

668
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,099
work from 4 30 in the morning to seven

669
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,080
o'clock in the morning at the farm then

670
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,178
I go to school and then at night or on

671
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,678
the weekends I'll get in another

672
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,240
you know a few hours here and there

673
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,940
averages out to four to five hours a day

674
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,440
yeah I think I read in one of your other

675
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,538
interviews like in the caption or

676
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,460
whatever that you're a PE teacher yep I

677
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:37,919
teach uh elementary PE K through five

678
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,740
that's funny my uh brother-in-law is

679
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,538
also a PE teacher so yeah it's not bad I

680
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,220
mean everybody's like oh that's the

681
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,319
easiest job ever and I said come and

682
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,298
spend eight hours with 300 screaming

683
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,158
kids I mean yeah I don't have to grade

684
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,980
papers and listen you know do lesson

685
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,740
plans too much but I have 300 screaming

686
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,919
kids for eight hours a day

687
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,599
so it's not all rainbows and sunshine uh

688
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,120
getting back onto plants I did want to

689
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,980
actually talk about pest prevention now

690
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,379
you have such a large space that you're

691
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,940
gardening on and I can imagine that

692
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,460
sometimes you have to deal with pests

693
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,380
what do you do to prevent pests from

694
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,419
occurring and have you ever had like any

695
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,400
infestations that you had to battle that

696
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:20,880
you can talk about so

697
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,340
my Arts I have two arch nemesis and if I

698
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,900
was God for a day I would destroy them

699
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,480
forever and they never walk the planet

700
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,340
again but they're um

701
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,798
this type of worm

702
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,678
it's actually a moth it's what a moth is

703
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,480
before it transforms into a moth it's

704
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,700
just a worm and it gets down in the

705
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,079
middle of your lettuce

706
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,460
and they like it there because it's

707
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,819
usually moist

708
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,740
dry you know moist warm or cool during

709
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,418
the summer it's cooled in the summer and

710
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,980
they just eat your plants from the good

711
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,659
lettuce from the inside out and you

712
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,940
don't know that it's there

713
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,720
until half your lettuce is gone

714
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,640
and so during spring and fall is the

715
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,319
worst so during the Spring of the Fall

716
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm literally digging

717
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,980
pretty much in every lettuce plant

718
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,798
looking for one because if there's one

719
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,599
three days later there'll be thousands

720
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,179
so it's one of those things you you want

721
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,459
to stay on top of and they have this

722
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,140
I hate using it it's completely organic

723
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,460
you can spray it in your mouth it tastes

724
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,120
I actually did it just to make sure

725
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,240
tastes like crap but and it doesn't kill

726
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,719
the the worm what it actually does is

727
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,058
it makes the worm's mouth too sticky to

728
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,360
open up and then it starves to death

729
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:35,759
so it's not like a pesticide it's more

730
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,699
like a glue but it's completely safe for

731
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:42,359
people so that's the only spray that I

732
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,179
use and then the other pest that I fight

733
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,278
continuously with is hornworms

734
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,259
for tomato plants you know the big fat

735
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,140
green worms that have the horns sticking

736
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:55,619
out they will destroy a tomato plant

737
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,840
in two days I mean I had a real bad

738
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,719
um in the middle of October I lost

739
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,480
30 of my tomatoes to hornworms but the

740
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,000
the weather conditions were perfect

741
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,500
um for them and now the way you can't

742
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,058
even spray anything for them you

743
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,679
literally have to just sit there and

744
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,720
pick them off

745
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,700
um luckily they're not that hard to find

746
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,860
you can get a black light

747
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,200
and they glow in the dark

748
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,519
so they have a very fluorescent color at

749
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,080
night so

750
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,759
sometimes I take my kids out there and

751
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,658
say Here's a dollar for everyone that

752
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,158
you find

753
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,080
or something

754
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,760
I mean but those are the two that I have

755
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,099
everything else

756
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,700
I've learned if you

757
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:38,339
create spaces for

758
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,179
the pest Predators they take care of

759
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,639
them

760
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,919
if that makes sense so like Gabe Brown I

761
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,640
mentioned earlier he said that he heard

762
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,980
a scientist say there's 1700 beneficial

763
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,820
plants for everyone pest so I'm sorry

764
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:57,120
1700 beneficial insects for one pest but

765
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:59,158
you have to give them the environment to

766
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,158
thrive in for them to go search so

767
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,740
that's why mono crop is so bad for

768
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,039
farming because there's no place for the

769
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,359
good pass to live so like in the middle

770
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,720
of my bed

771
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,459
I might have a three foot raised box on

772
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,759
top of my raised bed that's just got

773
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,980
flowers in it Salvia and marigolds and

774
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,778
you know different stuff and it looks

775
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,700
completely insane because it's right in

776
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:25,919
the middle of zucchini but the stuff

777
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,840
that eats the squash bugs which is

778
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,820
usually a bad problem for people with

779
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,699
you know zucchini and squash they but

780
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:35,579
those good insects live in that flower

781
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,798
little group of flowers right there you

782
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,898
know cover crops are the same way

783
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:43,440
not mowing your cover crop gives those

784
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:45,778
beneficial insects a home to live when

785
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,759
you need them so it's pretty much

786
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:50,460
companion planting as well that you're

787
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,079
utilizing is there any other companion

788
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,120
plants that you have besides the ones

789
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,038
you just mentioned it's not so many it's

790
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,678
so much companion planting it's what

791
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,480
fits in that empty spot in the ground

792
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,000
that I can grow and make money off of

793
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,000
while like when Tomatoes get my tomatoes

794
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,220
get up to 10 feet tall

795
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,839
have you ever heard of lean and lower no

796
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,339
I haven't it's when your tomato plants

797
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,639
get so damn tall you can't reach the top

798
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:17,038
of them so I trellis my tomato plants on

799
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,380
one one string straight up and when they

800
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,419
get so tall you unravel some string at

801
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,159
the top and you lower them and they lean

802
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,200
like this and then they start to grow up

803
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,299
again well all this space down here

804
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,058
there's nothing there because I pruned

805
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,859
that because to keep fungus and disease

806
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:34,798
and stuff off the tomato plants so I'll

807
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:37,259
go in I'll plant radishes or beets or

808
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,418
lettuce or whatever I can think of that

809
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:40,679
I know I can sell then I need that you

810
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,299
know need to get in the ground I'll

811
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,940
plant underneath

812
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:47,519
those tomato plants for example

813
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,019
so it it doesn't hurt anything but I

814
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,058
don't know if it if you call it

815
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:55,079
companion planting it's more like

816
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:56,879
make money planting understood yeah so

817
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,038
let's say you've gone through the entire

818
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,620
Grill process you didn't deal with any

819
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,720
pests that took away your crop

820
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,278
harvesting let's get into that how do

821
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,298
you go about harvesting and what do you

822
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,298
typically get for yields

823
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,278
um it depends on what it is

824
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,839
um you know salad I sell in a Ziploc one

825
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,019
gallon Ziploc bag

826
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,579
it's not the most process you know I get

827
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,379
DMS all the time you're losing too much

828
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,778
money buying Ziploc bags you should use

829
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,720
the Uline one gallon bags with this tie

830
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:30,119
but my customers like the Ziploc bags

831
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,159
you know so I'll spend an extra 10 cents

832
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,500
and so anyway I'm getting off on a

833
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,659
tangent so

834
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,538
like the Ziploc bag is six heads of

835
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,299
lettuce and I sell it for five bucks

836
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:45,419
that just just to give you an idea

837
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,700
um and but I plant four rows every eight

838
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:51,000
inches so like I could get into the math

839
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,919
until you you know real door numbers but

840
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,220
just on basis

841
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,020
I can on a 50 foot bed I'll make 500

842
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,880
every eight weeks

843
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,679
on average you know during the summer

844
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,299
it's every six weeks during the fall and

845
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,220
the winter it's 10 to 12 weeks because

846
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,740
stuff just doesn't grow as fast

847
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,558
but it's very easy to get five crops

848
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,079
five to six crops of lettuce out of one

849
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,240
bed in a 12 month time period

850
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,199
and you can usually get about 500 for

851
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,120
that bed so now you can do the math

852
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,880
uh tomatoes

853
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,199
you know it just depends on the crop I

854
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,659
could spend an hour telling you about it

855
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,440
but I the easiest way I can tell you is

856
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:33,659
once you're set up it's so much profit

857
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,038
margin is so high you can't even imagine

858
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,679
because you're not

859
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,619
I mean the worm castings you pay for the

860
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,059
seeds cheap as hell the main thing is

861
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,979
your time

862
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:46,259
and I tell people all the time I don't

863
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,419
even know what to like pay myself hourly

864
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,000
wage because I would do it for free

865
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,679
like if I never made another Dom I'd

866
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,798
still Farm just the way I do now just

867
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,679
because I love it but the profit margins

868
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:01,619
are insane when you start

869
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,538
when you when you can quit buying stuff

870
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:05,278
like you want to buy another tunnel you

871
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:06,538
don't have to make more beds you don't

872
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,519
have to do this you don't have to do

873
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:09,778
that once you get your farm into a

874
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,000
machine

875
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:14,099
it's probably 80 profit margin that's

876
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,460
incredible I mean it takes a while to

877
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:19,199
get it to that point but when you do you

878
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,120
as long as you don't do something stupid

879
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,460
and or you know tornado hits or

880
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,319
something and screws everything up it's

881
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,440
just a machine it's a well-oiled machine

882
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,879
you do boom boom boom wait three weeks

883
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,980
and then do it all over again you know

884
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,480
it's it's simple especially once you get

885
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,240
that soil right like the first time you

886
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,159
use the soil is one thing but year after

887
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,480
year after year as that soil is getting

888
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,640
better and better and better with all

889
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,500
the microbes in there and the nutrition

890
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,500
that's in there you got to be getting

891
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,599
better and better crops each year in the

892
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,880
limits that I have that I put in they

893
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,278
don't get used every year like the

894
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,260
soybean meal I can dig down in there and

895
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,839
I can see soybean meal from

896
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:58,859
a year ago like it just has it's a

897
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,720
yellow color

898
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,879
so that's still there

899
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,480
you know the worm castings are still

900
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,579
there so it's it's all the you know if I

901
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
put triple 10 fertilizer which isn't

902
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,918
organic and I'd never use it but if I

903
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,199
did

904
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,719
that should be gone in a month

905
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,539
or less and then and my soil is fried

906
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,000
from all the from too much nitrogen and

907
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:23,398
phosphorus and all that so when you say

908
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,378
it actually gets better I'm building my

909
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:26,878
soil legitimately every single year

910
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:29,219
because I'm adding more castings more so

911
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,960
cover cropping like it just gets better

912
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,898
and the yields go up and

913
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,838
it makes your plants stronger it fights

914
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:38,460
off disease and bugs and so it's more

915
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,079
than just yield that you know that

916
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,838
you're counting on you're saving money

917
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,878
by not having to buy more stuff yeah

918
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,519
that makes sense so after you've grown

919
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,659
the plant and harvested them I mean you

920
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,099
talk you talked a little bit about this

921
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,800
in the beginning but how do you go about

922
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,960
selling the produce that you've grown so

923
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,359
I'm different from

924
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,179
probably every other farmer that does

925
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,739
what I do I don't do farmers markets

926
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:05,039
um I'm glad they're there for Farmers

927
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:08,039
but I hate them look I want my I have

928
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,199
all my products sold before I harvest it

929
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,420
um I have a list actually that right

930
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,460
there is my customer list

931
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,539
and that's my that's what I go off of if

932
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,519
you look like I have week a and week B

933
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:21,239
so I have two weeks

934
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,358
um

935
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,219
and week a I delivered this group of

936
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:27,299
people week B I delivered to this group

937
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,618
of people and they're like why do you

938
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,920
have two weeks

939
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,720
because most people can't eat or don't

940
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,720
want to eat all that produce in one week

941
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,578
and then boom have it again on Sunday

942
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,078
you know there's only so much zucchini

943
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,660
you can eat during the summer

944
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,820
but if they eat it one week and then

945
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:46,199
they do something else the next week by

946
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,240
Friday or Saturday that next week

947
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,219
they're like oh Mike's bringing me that

948
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,919
his basket tomorrow I call it a basket

949
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,199
you know that basket has salad zucchini

950
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,539
Tomatoes beets

951
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,460
green beans in it you know and so

952
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,019
they're ready for it so it's kind of

953
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,519
like that I was saying keep them wanting

954
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:04,380
more

955
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,679
and I have a few customers that I sell

956
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,358
to every single week I maybe

957
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,559
I think I got two people up there that I

958
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,420
still do every single week because

959
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,699
they're vegetarians

960
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,940
and I'm happy you know they're happy

961
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,919
they love it and it works out great but

962
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,599
if you ever start people out there if

963
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,880
you ever start

964
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,380
at least consider doing two different

965
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,420
weeks of customers

966
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,039
just so because I always wanted customer

967
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,539
to say I can't wait to get your stuff as

968
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,119
opposed to oh crap you're bringing me

969
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:35,099
more stuff you know that's you want to

970
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,019
be wanted not like a hassle how did you

971
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,980
find the customers to begin with and

972
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,780
then how do you like do the

973
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,219
communication with them is it through

974
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,980
like an email list or is it all

975
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,659
individual or what it's a

976
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,219
there's not a whole lot of communication

977
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,500
anymore because they know

978
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,480
like they know I'm going to drop it off

979
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,338
at this time like I live in a

980
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,440
subdivision and a little town outside of

981
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:59,480
Dallas and there's 600 homes in my

982
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,179
subdivision and it's you know a fairly

983
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:06,358
well-off community and so

984
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,980
they know on Sunday evening I'm bringing

985
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,679
in bringing in their stuff

986
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,780
and I just drive around drop off the

987
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,019
baskets you know in my neighborhood and

988
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,220
then a lot of my customers are teachers

989
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,179
um teachers anyone that's starting

990
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,980
that's thinking about doing this

991
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,659
teachers will be very best customer you

992
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
could ever have if you're selling salad

993
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:24,960
mix because they only get 30 minutes for

994
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,639
lunch

995
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,480
they don't have time to heat anything up

996
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,578
really

997
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,400
more than likely they're trying to lose

998
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:35,940
a few pounds or at least eat healthier

999
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,680
so salad's the best tell them they have

1000
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,240
a fruit salad on Monday

1001
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,879
they can have egg white salads on

1002
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,578
Tuesday tuna salad on Wednesday chicken

1003
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,660
salad on Thursday and a nut salad on

1004
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,720
Friday

1005
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:50,940
it's five completely solids you take it

1006
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,098
to them on Monday

1007
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,200
it's literally the easiest sell in the

1008
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,800
world and if you know

1009
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,719
teachers are great anywhere that there's

1010
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,859
a lot of people hospitals like I

1011
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,598
delivered to One hospital because

1012
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:05,759
there's like 10 nurses that buy from me

1013
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,780
they're all in the

1014
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,859
I went blank Navy Ward pregnancy gonna

1015
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,320
have babies

1016
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:14,460
Dawn that that shot that uh

1017
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,740
floor

1018
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,260
what's that called oh my God what is it

1019
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,459
I'll put you on the spot now

1020
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,859
but anyway you know what I'm talking

1021
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,240
about yeah yeah yeah so and nurses are

1022
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:26,098
always busy you know they're just like

1023
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,899
teachers they got 30 minutes if that so

1024
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,559
they want something quick healthy fast

1025
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,960
tasty and I always Harvest Sunday

1026
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,739
morning a harvest Sunday night of the

1027
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,199
liver

1028
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,539
or Monday morning I deliver so it's

1029
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,639
literally 24 hours and old at the most

1030
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:43,320
as opposed to

1031
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,940
you buy salad at the grocery store and

1032
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,280
everyone's like why is my salad going by

1033
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,619
it's only day three it's not day three

1034
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,260
it's day 12.

1035
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,660
because it is harvested in California

1036
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,339
packaged in California SAT on a

1037
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:57,659
warehouse before he got shipped to where

1038
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,179
we're you know to Dallas from California

1039
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:02,460
sit in the back of Walmart

1040
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:04,980
day eight or nine it finally got on the

1041
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,320
Shelf day nine or ten you bought it day

1042
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,240
12 it's earned that's just the way our

1043
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,820
supply system works which is completely

1044
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,799
stupid whereas if you buy mine

1045
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,660
it was 24 hours old

1046
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,440
or not in your mind anyone that grows

1047
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:18,659
local

1048
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,159
is 24 hours old I've had people put it

1049
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,719
in the back of their fridge and their

1050
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,098
kids put stuff in front of it and then

1051
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,480
they pull it out and it's been two weeks

1052
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,700
and they eat it it's as fresh as it was

1053
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,820
the day I gave it to them the freshness

1054
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:33,239
is unmatched I uh locally here I have

1055
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,338
green life produce and uh yeah getting

1056
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:37,078
it right from right after harvest I'm

1057
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,358
getting it probably within 24 hours and

1058
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,400
it's delicious better than anything I've

1059
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,139
ever bought from a store my teachers

1060
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,119
didn't want to put a crack in my salad

1061
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:46,440
to tell them that I'm a crack dealer I

1062
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,019
accidentally actually put crack in there

1063
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,079
because it's so addicting

1064
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:55,259
so I got to ask for your half acre

1065
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,140
Garden that you're growing plants on how

1066
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,720
many customers are you supplying during

1067
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,279
the summer when stuff grows so much

1068
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,118
faster

1069
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,300
um

1070
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,338
I can do 40 a week pretty easy

1071
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,960
you know and that that's 40 you know

1072
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:11,460
baskets

1073
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,260
um yeah in a basket like I said is

1074
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,539
usually 15 to 20 bucks

1075
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,280
and it's

1076
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:20,039
just to give people an idea of the math

1077
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,480
I chose five dollars for salad and 250

1078
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,239
for everything else

1079
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,760
so like tomatoes are 250 which is too

1080
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,919
cheap it should be 350. but then I also

1081
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,920
charge 250 for Beats which is too much

1082
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,480
but it averages out and then it's just

1083
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,500
simple and I've never had anyone

1084
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,780
complain

1085
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,519
about money most people actually

1086
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,560
if I tell them this week it's 15 bucks

1087
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,000
they usually just give me 20.

1088
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,078
you know because I also delivered to

1089
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,659
their door

1090
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,359
I when I started I said you know what

1091
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:50,279
Amazon just bought Whole Foods

1092
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,159
Amazon's going to be delivering stuff

1093
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,140
now they got covet hit Walmart started

1094
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,500
delivering so I was like I have to

1095
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:00,358
deliver too so I changed my focus around

1096
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,119
of marketing and started marketing

1097
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,519
really close to my house or my school or

1098
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,599
my work so literally everybody that I

1099
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,519
sell to

1100
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,440
I could be there within they're probably

1101
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:13,139
within a mile of my house or my school

1102
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,720
it works really well that way I can

1103
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:18,420
imagine it's super rewarding supplying

1104
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,819
the folks around you with the food oh

1105
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,519
it's I've had people cry

1106
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,980
and not not because it was so good

1107
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,139
because like one lady her husband worked

1108
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,900
for TruGreen for 25 years and now has

1109
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,578
Parkinson's disease and you know

1110
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,858
obviously nobody can prove it but she

1111
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,440
swears it was because of working for

1112
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:40,139
True Green and she doesn't want to feed

1113
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,700
her grandkids that come over

1114
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:43,379
you know stuff from the supermarket

1115
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,578
because even if it says organic at the

1116
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,700
supermarket

1117
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,140
it's not or the organic label's been so

1118
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:51,358
watered down that's why I'm not

1119
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:54,659
certified organic they can kiss my ass

1120
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,598
like I I have absolutely no respect for

1121
00:41:54,659 --> 00:42:00,000
that organic label anymore because it's

1122
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,099
the lobbyist has said you know what this

1123
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
we can slide this in here I mean

1124
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,859
Hydroponics or aquaponics is certified

1125
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,960
organic please tell me how that can be

1126
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:12,179
organic when all you use is chemicals to

1127
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,420
feed the plant

1128
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:17,639
like it doesn't make sense so

1129
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,559
um that's my soapbox like if you want to

1130
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:22,139
piss me off bring up organic labeling

1131
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,779
and not I'll get a little far away but

1132
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,578
but back to the whole thing was the lady

1133
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,200
like Lily cried she's like I've been

1134
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,119
looking for this for so long I can't

1135
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:31,259
grow anything and I just want to know

1136
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,460
I'm feeding my grandkids something

1137
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,480
because I don't want them to end up like

1138
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,460
my husband

1139
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,679
and literally she's like just got tears

1140
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,079
coming down around and that was

1141
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,819
super rewarding and I've got people to

1142
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,359
be like oh you've got to try my I'm the

1143
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,160
salad guy like if somebody meets me that

1144
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:48,659
nose of my salad they're like you're the

1145
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,480
salad guy

1146
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,239
yeah I'm I'm a salad guy that's me I

1147
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,280
guess but yeah it's super rewarding it's

1148
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,379
inspiring and you know what we just went

1149
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,780
over in this episode how you do it I

1150
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,940
think a lot of people are going to enjoy

1151
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,160
listening to your story and it in

1152
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,539
realize that it's possible you know I

1153
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,940
think a lot of people

1154
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,400
think about Urban gardening and think

1155
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,960
about supplying people locally and they

1156
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,639
think that it's gonna cost a bunch of

1157
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,039
money to get started they think it's

1158
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,139
going to cost it's gonna be a ton of

1159
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,539
time doing this and what you just

1160
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:23,639
explained there that's not the case you

1161
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:25,500
get started cheaply now courses

1162
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:28,139
Investments with the tunnel and stuff

1163
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,599
over time but that'll pay for itself it

1164
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,879
sounds very very possible the way that

1165
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,039
you're doing it and I'm really glad that

1166
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,019
you decided to come on here and share

1167
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,519
your story I do have a few more

1168
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:40,139
questions for you one of them is a

1169
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,000
question that you actually wanted me to

1170
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:44,098
ask you which is why do you think Urban

1171
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,500
farming is going to be important in the

1172
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,380
future I mean covid taught us so much

1173
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,900
and now with the war in you know

1174
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:53,300
overseas and

1175
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,920
basically everything's just Fallen apart

1176
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,220
that's it's some I mean the supply chain

1177
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,500
is such a joke and the fact that we have

1178
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:03,419
to go to Whole Foods or sprouts

1179
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,179
and I don't know how many people do this

1180
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:09,180
but I look and see where stuff comes

1181
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:11,818
from and why in the hell we buy beets

1182
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,500
that are grown in Mexico

1183
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:14,940
um as an example because I just saw a

1184
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,480
label the other day it said made in

1185
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,220
Mexico on a beat it blows my mind the

1186
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,019
amount of everyone's worried about the

1187
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:24,059
climate change why are we spending so

1188
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,639
much money on diesel and exhaust

1189
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,920
shipping beads from Mexico or even

1190
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,598
California to Texas

1191
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,059
I mean California is a whole nother

1192
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,240
podcast in itself the damn place of the

1193
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:38,818
desert we decided to make California the

1194
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:41,039
capital of AG in the United States and

1195
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:42,539
it's a freaking desert and now we're

1196
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,000
paying the price because there's no

1197
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:47,818
water dog pushers are running dry it's

1198
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,739
quit raining the Lake Mead is at the

1199
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,659
slowest level in history

1200
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:53,639
and we get something like 80 percent of

1201
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:56,219
our lettuce from California

1202
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,299
it doesn't make sense

1203
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:01,858
um

1204
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:04,619
so all that to say Urban AG

1205
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:06,779
checks the boxes of so many things the

1206
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,700
customers are literally next door

1207
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,800
and if you want to get

1208
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:13,679
in into details about other things like

1209
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,300
grocery stores dying for local produce

1210
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,679
and I don't mean Kroger Tom Thumb and

1211
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,960
Albertsons those places are impossible

1212
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,000
but like organic food stores are

1213
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,760
starting to pop up everywhere they would

1214
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,260
love to have an urban farm two miles

1215
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,000
down the road and be like yeah try my

1216
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,980
salad mix I get it from a bike two miles

1217
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,260
down the road it's just a great story

1218
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,019
people love buying local

1219
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,200
I mean we know our mechanic

1220
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:38,699
we know our doctor

1221
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,338
we know the got Footlocker that sells

1222
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,779
our shoes by name but we don't know who

1223
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,239
put who grows the food that we put in

1224
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,940
our body and most of all our kids body

1225
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,399
that's just back ass words to me

1226
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,720
so I really just want people to

1227
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,780
understand

1228
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,759
going forward in the next five years and

1229
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,000
Warren Buffett said this

1230
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,740
and he said lawyers and doctors were the

1231
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,239
people that made the money in the past

1232
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,639
and they will continue to make the money

1233
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,818
but moving forward farmers

1234
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,900
will be included into that category in

1235
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:12,719
the future

1236
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,800
and I really believe that I mean Warren

1237
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,239
Buffett's not wrong about too many

1238
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,400
things well you like the guy or not he's

1239
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,919
not wrong very often

1240
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,380
So and I've seen it I mean I've lived it

1241
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,838
for six years now and

1242
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,940
the amount of money you can make is

1243
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:30,000
ridiculous once you figure things out

1244
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,338
and the best thing about figuring it out

1245
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,559
is there's YouTube

1246
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:36,059
there's a guy named Curtis Stone and

1247
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,500
I'll make this real quick there's a guy

1248
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,358
named Curtis Stone he's known as the

1249
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,460
Urban Farmer and he's the one that made

1250
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,098
this type of farming popular he's in

1251
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,960
Canada he farms and in Canada in his

1252
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:48,599
town they have it's an old town so they

1253
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,679
have big yards like third of an acre

1254
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,260
yards

1255
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:55,199
quarter acre yards and he farmed nine

1256
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,240
people's backyard along with his the

1257
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,460
exact same way I'm doing mine

1258
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,399
and he made 150 000 a year every year

1259
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,920
for like 10 years so he started vlogging

1260
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,800
and he vlogged every day for 365 days

1261
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,880
like a little 20 minute this is what I'm

1262
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,560
doing today

1263
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,780
and showed you how to do it and that's

1264
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,480
where I learned about salad mix

1265
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,819
and you know greens and all that and the

1266
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,559
business side of it so literally you

1267
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:21,779
have a free course to learn how to learn

1268
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:22,679
like learn how to grow commercially on

1269
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,380
YouTube

1270
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:28,739
now you have Instagram and I will stay

1271
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,260
up 48 hours in a row helping people get

1272
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:32,159

1278
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,759
breathe this stuff and I want to help as

1279
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,379
many people get started as I can that's

1280
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,220
really kind for you to do that you might

1281
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,900
regret your decision after this no I I I

1282
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:57,299
I really won't it's almost like paying

1283
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:00,358
it for it because I would not be where I

1284
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,060
am and have the happiness that I have if

1285
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:05,639
it would have been for Curtis start his

1286
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:07,078
YouTube videos and there's you know jm48

1287
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,118
you can look him up too if you're

1288
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,280
interested in them there's just a ton of

1289
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,960
people out there that's doing what I'm

1290
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,980
doing now on YouTube I just don't have

1291
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,900
the time

1292
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,480
or as you figure it out trying to set

1293
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,119
this up the technology ability to figure

1294
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,619
it out yeah it's not easy but uh you

1295
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,079
know what you're doing is is really

1296
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:27,000
great so so thank you for that one last

1297
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,280
thing would be is there any other advice

1298
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,679
that you want to give folks looking to

1299
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,720
do the same thing as you just start and

1300
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,659
don't worry about killing everything

1301
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,759
like I killed so much stuff I look back

1302
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,440
and I'm like God I was an idiot but I

1303
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,880
learned I mean experience is the

1304
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,099
greatest teacher

1305
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,800
but again luckily for you you don't have

1306
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:48,240
to just learn from experience only like

1307
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,680
you can DM me you can watch the Youtube

1308
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,419
videos you can do all these other things

1309
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,578
to learn how to start

1310
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,680
and

1311
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,839
there's so much money to be made if

1312
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,460
you're 50 right now and hate your job

1313
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,679
and you're going to retire in two years

1314
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,900
but you need a little extra income this

1315
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,279
is the absolute perfect job for you and

1316
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,960
you gotta love growing stuff and get

1317
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,060
your hands dirty you know

1318
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,740
but there's nothing better than waking

1319
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:13,139
up and you know going to your farm at

1320
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,939
seven o'clock in the morning and

1321
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:16,618
literally hearing the birds chirping

1322
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,780
watch the sun come up half my post on

1323
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,280
Instagram Rose is the sun coming up over

1324
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,420
the horizon and I don't know why he

1325
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,700
posted it because it's literally the

1326
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,159
same pictures but is there something

1327
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,598
about it that's just it just brings you

1328
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,759
back to

1329
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,700
to the world that we live in as opposed

1330
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,220
to cubicle and traffic and all that

1331
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,139
other crap so let's wrap things up how

1332
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,118
can the listeners find you and what do

1333
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,578
you have upcoming in the future

1334
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,519
um Instagram's probably the best it's

1335
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,180
Dallas half acre Farm

1336
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,920
um

1337
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,199
that's the easy way to shoot me a DM

1338
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,639
comment you know hey I dm'd you because

1339
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,980
sometimes if we don't follow each other

1340
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,900
it goes to a separate account in my

1341
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,358
inbox and it's kind of a pain to find

1342
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,300
sometimes so just let me know

1343
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:02,159
um you can email me

1344
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,619
embell971 Yahoo if you don't do

1345
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,699
Instagram I give you my phone number but

1346
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,500
my wife would get pretty pissed about

1347
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:09,239
that one but after we email I'll

1348
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,179
definitely give you my phone number

1349
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,519
and um so those are the three I don't do

1350
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:16,739
YouTube yet I want to I just don't

1351
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:18,900
have the capability brain wise it's too

1352
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:21,659
full of plant to add in technology

1353
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,400
to but uh hopefully one day I'll be able

1354
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,980
to but those are the three easiest ways

1355
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,318
to or two easy ways to contact me and

1356
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,119
and don't hesitate to do it okay you

1357
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,639
