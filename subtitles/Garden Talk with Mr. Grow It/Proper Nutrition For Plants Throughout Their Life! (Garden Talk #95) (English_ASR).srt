1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
coming up on Garden talk having a

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,200
diverse and healthy roots on ecology is

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,660
like one of the non-essential elements

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,980
of a growing that is probably one of the

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,080
most essential things that we're

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,719
learning so like the environmental

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,980
factories your soil moisture content and

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,579
you know the temperature of the room

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,380
have a huge role to play in the nutrient

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,599
uptake and transpiration ability of your

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,358
plants you know your mineral nutrition

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,520
your your nitrates your phosphorus your

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,579
potassium that is the same molecule

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,219
regardless of bottle salt bran country

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,020
of origin all of that the plants are

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,920
constantly evolving as we're growing

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,020
them you know because they're not

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,120
growing out in the wild so their needs

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,680
are going to evolve as well so it's a

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,538
that's why I think things like Leaf

21
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,280
tissue testing leachate testing are so

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,939
important to really know what the

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,939
plant's eating

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,320
what's up everybody if you that don't

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,579
know me my name is Chris aka Mr Grow it

26

Consulting for things such as IPM Plant

31
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,780
Nutrition gaining efficiency and

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,240
cultivations and cultivation protocol

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,579
planning I narrow down the focus in this

34
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,618
episode to proper nutrition for plants

35
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,599

one of my goals for this podcast is to

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,519
bring free gardening information of all

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,780
plants to the general public the that

53
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,000
being said I'd like to thank the

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,340
sponsors of today's episode who helped

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
make that goal possible thanks to aec

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,420
Infinity for sponsoring this episode

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,939
they now have humidifiers called the

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,239
cloud Forge I'd be using the cloud Forge

59
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:14,159
T3 which has a 4.5 liter capacity and

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,900
can be filled from the top it also

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,180
includes a hose so you can place the

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,459
humidifier outside your grow tent and

63
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,680
feed the hose into your grow tent saving

64
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,900
you precious space it also connects to

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,180
the controller 69 Pro so you can control

66
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,860
it from your smartphone I'll have a link

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,480
in the description section below so you

68
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,879
can learn more about their humidifiers

69
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,280
and the discount code Mr Grow at 15

70
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,239
works on both Amazon and their website

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,340
AC infinity.com and we're back welcome

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,620
to the Garden Talk podcast today I am

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,719
joined with Mike Chang from Canon cribs

74
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,519
Consulting how you doing today hey good

75
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,560
how are you Chris good good thanks for

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,019
asking so you and I have worked on some

77
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,939
projects in the past and I feel like it

78
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,519
was just a few months ago where I was

79
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,318
like come on the podcast gotta get the

80
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,000
podcast

81
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,280
you have so much good knowledge when it

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,439
comes to Horticulture you have a ton of

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,780
knowledge and plant nutrition IPM

84
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,300
gaining efficiencies and cultivations

85
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,219
and cultivation protocol planning so

86
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,080
today I figured we'd focus in on Plant

87
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,818
Nutrition I have a bunch of good

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,379
questions lined up for you and I think

89
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,899
this is going to bring a lot of value to

90
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,039
the audience but first can you tell us a

91
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,099
little bit about yourself and how you

92
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,199
got into gardening yeah sure so I guess

93
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,119
I started everything after I got out of

94
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,639
the military in 2010 and I started to

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,259
grow at home in California uh just kind

96
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,699
of a hobbyist but back then it was kind

97
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,679
of wild Westy and you could sell your

98
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,539
bud to co-ops and all that other stuff

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,159
so it's pretty fun

100
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,560
um and after that I wanted to kind of

101
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,639
get a an education in agriculture and

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
kind of do things a little bit more

103
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,619
properly so I went to the U of A in

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,120
Arizona and uh while I was there I got a

105
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,280
really good internship at an ad company

106
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,640
and pivoted into agriculture for a while

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,818
and so I was working in like field corn

108
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,179
um cotton a lot of greenhouse stuff so

109
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,399
cucumbers Tomatoes the agricultural

110
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,340
World in Arizona is pretty pretty vast

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,379
so I wasn't uh I wasn't short on work

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,120
there but I just got the itch to come

113
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,759
back and that's when I got with Nate and

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,799
uh and we started to just uh I started

115
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,780
to work for him and we kind of built

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,139
this Consulting side awesome

117
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,180
so getting into Plant Nutrition there

118
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,560
are essential elements for plants and

119
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,780
there are non-essential elements for

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,019
plants talk to us about the Essential

121
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,179
Elements for plants sure so the common

122
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,339
knowledge for most essential nutrients

123
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,978
is going to be like your NPK your

124
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,000
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and

125
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,120
then you have your slew of

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,699
micronutrients the micronutrients that's

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,860
uh that's what we know as essential

128
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,319
right now things like molybdenum Boron

129
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,720
iron manganese you know the the main

130
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,879
Usual Suspects but we're constantly

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,000
learning about new

132
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,399
roles that elements play in Plants as we

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
continue to study plants which is kind

134
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,219
of an interesting thing that you asked

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
about non-essential elements I mean I

136
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,060
can go over the Essential Elements first

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
here so like nitrogen

138
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,978
basic building block that's going to be

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,540
for all your amino acids you know um all

140
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:11,579
of the cell structures things like that

141
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,620
so that's basic building blocks for

142
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,240
tissues and chlorophyll your phosphorus

143
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,939
is going to be mainly your energy

144
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,120
transport things like it's moving in ATP

145
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,918
it's it's helping move

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,379
um metabolites across membranes things

147
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,478
like that potassium is going to be for

148
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,519
your enzyme activation and to move

149
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,519
sugars across the plan and for osmotic

150
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,279
pressure so those three things are the

151
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,918
most used by the plant

152
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,959
in addition to oxygen carbon and

153
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,758
hydrogen of course but all the

154
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,560
micronutrients play other roles in the

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
plant they're kind of like vitamins in

156
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
humans where we need carbs fat and

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,139
protein but we also need vitamins for

158
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,478
all of our other functions and the

159
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,478
micronutrients like calcium sulfur

160
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,978
magnesium those all fill that role and

161
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,599
so the micronutrients and the

162
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,719
macronutrients would be considered your

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,419
Essential Elements and we can go into

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,880
any one of those in more detail okay got

165
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,560
it and then for the non-essential

166
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,719
elements for plants I think one that

167
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,740
comes to mind right away is silica right

168
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,740
although silica is essential in some

169
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,720
plants but not in the medicinal plant

170
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,000
that we all know and love right correct

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,580
however the research is still out

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,399
because what a lot of the current

173
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:29,639
research on silica's role in a plant's

174
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,459
metabolism now is finding is that not

175
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,199
only is it kind of a maybe not part of

176
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,579
metabolism and it just gets deposited

177
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,139
onto cell walls and that's why everyone

178
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,418
knows that it's good to have silicon

179
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,819
plants so that they don't get overfed on

180
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,620
by bugs but silica actually plays a

181
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,600
pretty important role in a lot of the

182
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,699
metabolic pathways for biotic and

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
abiotic stress in the plant whether it's

184
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,560
drought or some sort of a pest like a

185
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,138
chewing bug or even like a fungal

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
pathogen so now that we're seeing that

187
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,220
silica is involved in those metabolic

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
pathways a lot of those metabolic

189
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,300
pathways we know are conserved in other

190
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,279
plants and higher plants so all it takes

191
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,400
at this point is for us to connect the

192
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,500
dots in the research to see how silica

193
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,120
actually functions in the medicinal

194
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,160
plants that we're typically trying to

195
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,918
cultivate at large scale and then kind

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
of have hard evidence for that but now

197
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,598
the kind of common knowledge is changing

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,300
where silica is being considered a a

199
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,639
kind of an essential nutrient as far as

200
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,759
making sure that a cultivation whether

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,598
it's field AG or indoor AG is maximizing

202
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,000
its growing potential and reducing its

203
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,199
need for like pest control products by

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,538
increasing the plant's natural

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,939
resistance to things what are some ways

206
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,560
that folks can add in silica to the

207
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,538
Garden I know like on the organic side

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,699
of things you've got rice holes and then

209
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:50,098
if you are going with synthetic or a

210
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,439
mineral based it usually comes within a

211
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:54,839
bottle right usually it's what

212
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,000
orthosolic acid I believe yeah some sort

213
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,638
of salicic acid yeah

214
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,259
and those are all great sources salicic

215
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,259
acids kind of work in the principle of

216
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,419
like Direct Delivery or kind of uh very

217
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,000
close as close to Direct Delivery as

218
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,038
typically was available

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,019
um other potassium other sources like

220
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,818
potassium silicates kind of rely on your

221
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,279
root zones ecology to make that silica

222
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,900
available to the plant as well there's a

223
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,939
newer technology out that certain

224
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,978
companies like I think I know of antenna

225
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,740
plant science is using it it's a silica

226
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,300
nanoparticle so it's an SNP and there's

227
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,060
been research showing that silica

228
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,820
particles under 20 micro meter or 20

229
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,740
microns in size can directly get uptaken

230
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,300
into the plant so there's there's newer

231
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,940
ways that we're finding to deliver

232
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:42,000
silica into plants that are a little bit

233
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,680
more efficient and won't really mess

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,240
with mineral nutrition programs like

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,939
potassium silicates and things like that

236
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,560
would and are kind of I use at a lower

237
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,300
rate so you don't have to use so much of

238
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,299
it now so my next question is what is

239
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,458
like the application rate for silica it

240
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,778
that is one of those gray areas where

241
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,699
the research has hasn't fully been

242
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,500
elucidated yet for like things like

243
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,480
medicinal plants or even some of our

244
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,899
more major crops we know that it does

245
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,060
help there are certain set PPM

246
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,120
guidelines or set application guidelines

247
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:16,619
for certain products but those are all

248
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,080
based on a very narrow scope of research

249
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580
right now so

250
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,740
I think as we kind of like study it more

251
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,440
we'll find out the best way to the best

252
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,820
way to apply and the best amounts to

253
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,740
apply so that we're not kind of over

254
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,300
applying because over applying

255
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,100
fertilizers has kind of been one of the

256
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,199
biggest issues right now in agriculture

257
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,060
so it's all about making sure that we're

258
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,519
being as efficient as possible that

259
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,919
makes sense what other non-essential

260
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,440
elements are out there that you would

261
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,000
recommend Growers consider adding into

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,100
the garden

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,899
um you know as far as elements I can't

264
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,519
really think of like uh like I couldn't

265
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,759
name like a metal that you should add

266
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,459
but there's certain aspects of plant

267
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,259
cultivation that are lost on the purely

268
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,059
mineral size out of it you can

269
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,458
absolutely grow a plant in an inert

270
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,199
environment with the right mineral

271
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,639
nutrition but there's certain things

272
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,820
like making sure that your carbon and

273
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,000
nitrogen ratio is correct having added

274
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,740
root Zone ecology to help fixate more

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,480
nitrogen out of the air help fixate

276
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,580
phosphorus that's in the soil that may

277
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,680
have become immobilized so I think

278
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,379
having a diverse and healthy roots on

279
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,719
ecology is like one of the non-essential

280
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,580
elements of a growing that is probably

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,500
one of the most essential things that

282
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,820
we're learning is like the interactions

283
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,278
that plants have with their roots on

284
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,860
ecology and just the the space around

285
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,019
them that kind of helps them optimize

286
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,379
their growth growth or not yeah the

287
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,360
balance of elements within the medium is

288
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,278
certainly important you know it's often

289
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,800
said that medicinal plants require more

290
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,720
nitrogen in the vegetation stage and

291
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,479
more phosphorus and potassium in the

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,420
flowering stage is that true science or

293
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,459
Bro Science

294
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,500
it's really true science yeah I mean the

295
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,239
Bros are right A lot of the times they

296
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,980
just haven't been validated yet you know

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,379
that's the problem

298
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,019
um so the main reason why you want to

299
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,059
add more nitrogen really to any growing

300
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,700
plant is to increase the growth to have

301
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,578
more basic building materials for those

302
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,100
building blocks for those amino acids so

303
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:19,139
and also High nitrogen delivery can

304
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,180
signal things in the plants that kind of

305
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,399
shift them to produce even more

306
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,099
vegetative growth more luxurious growth

307
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,259
to kind of be more hungry for other

308
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,659
nutrients which in turn adds to more

309
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,139
growth so higher nitrogen in earlier

310
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,939
stages is typically

311
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,679
recommended also because there's a lot

312
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,800
of research out that directly correlates

313
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,338
more plant biomass in the vegetative

314
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,439
stage equating to more inflorescence or

315
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,839
like more Cut Flower yield towards the

316
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,640
end so if you have more biomass in the

317
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,620
beginning if you can get more vigorous

318
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,899
healthy fast growth in a shorter amount

319
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,600
of time usually with higher nitrogen

320
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,399
rates then that's what you'd opt for so

321
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,040
that in flour you can get the most

322
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,440
benefits from that veg time and then as

323
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,599
far as kind of Shifting over into the

324
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,660
phosphorus and potassium side

325
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,579
phosphorus definitely is required by the

326
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,139
plant in in really both stages whether

327
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,059
it's the vegetative or the flowering

328
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,740
stage because like we talked about one

329
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,719
of the main reasons why the plant needs

330
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,759
phosphorus is for that energy transport

331
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,440
and for its metabolism

332
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,539
we don't want the plant to be

333
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,300
bottlenecked by phosphorus during those

334
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,519
critical stages in flower where we're

335
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,379
pumping secondary metabolites or we're

336
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,060
trying to increase cell density in

337
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:39,419
flowers things like that so phosphorus

338
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,458
can be very important in those later

339
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,899
stages and you might want to add like a

340
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,419
PK boost so you make sure that

341
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,039
phosphorus isn't your bottleneck now the

342
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,479
jury is a little bit out on potassium

343
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,838
there's been a couple of research

344
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,120
studies done on how potassium kind of

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,620
affects and it seems affects the growth

346
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,419
of medicinal plants or even other

347
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,639
cultivars of just kind of flowering

348
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,919
plants there seems to be a range that

349
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,959
like medicinal plants can tolerate when

350
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,958
it comes to potassium which is actually

351
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,399
a pretty wide range and there has been

352
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,919
research that shows that it's almost

353
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,839
maybe cultivar specific there's outliers

354
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,699
within research that show like you know

355
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,940
we didn't really get any results off of

356
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,339
high or low potassium in these in this

357
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,260
study except for this one strain where

358
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,019
you know higher potassium gave bushier

359
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,838
growth larger families things like that

360
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,519
so we're we're seeing that it's a little

361
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,440
bit cultivar specific when it comes to

362
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
potassium but the phosphorus definitely

363
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
you don't want that to be a bottleneck

364
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,419
so you do want to make sure that you're

365
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,120
applying enough

366
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,759
and um and you do want to make sure that

367
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,019
you are applying enough phosphorus in

368
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,700
the beginning stages where you need

369
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,679
those roots and shoots because it is

370
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,540
very important in that new growth as

371
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,638
well but it's also important in energy

372
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,500
transport later on down the line where

373
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,600
the plant is having a lot of secondary

374
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,339
metabolite actions and it needs to move

375
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,500
a lot of things throughout the plant and

376
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,180
it requires energy to do so

377
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,860
so yeah phosphorus definitely important

378
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,179
later on in flower but you definitely

379
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,680
don't want to over apply something like

380
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,239
phosphorus you want to do things like

381
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,919
maybe Leaf tissue testing to make sure

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,299
that you're doing the right amounts so

383
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,879
when you're growing hydroponically it's

384
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,059
a little bit easier to Precision feed

385
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,740
and get certain ratios of nitrogen and

386
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,299
phosphorus potassium so on and so forth

387
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,579
right but how about the folks that are

388
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,319
growing with bottles synthetics right

389
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,599
how do they control that how do they

390
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,760
ensure that they're not that the medium

391
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,740
is balanced with the proper elements

392
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,559
throughout the entire plant's life

393
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,419
so with keeping your nbk balance you

394
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,799
really have to kind of defer to the

395
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,078
manufacturer's specs on whatever

396
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,699
nutrient you're using

397
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,219
um that's why they'll usually break it

398
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,079
off into like a nitrate bottle or like a

399
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,060
cow mag bottle things like that so that

400
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,219
you can play with those numbers

401
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,198
if you wanted to get hard data of course

402
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,940
you would do things like Leaf tissue

403
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,620
testing which honestly is available to

404
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,600
the home Growers nowadays you can just

405
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,019
mail in your samples but if you didn't

406
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,820
want to get that kind of uh granular and

407
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,259
that focused on it what you'd want to do

408
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,240
is kind of just look at the numbers on

409
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,100
your bottles and then just do the math

410
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,480
on what you're putting down in that

411
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,420
gallon or so of water that you're

412
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,100
applying to your plants and then at that

413
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,899
point you can be assured that you have

414
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,519
at least those numbers I kind of call

415
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,339
that the shotgun approach

416
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,019
you have at least those set numbers that

417
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,360
you're delivering to the plant so that

418
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,000
the conditions are right enough the

419
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,259
plant will use those nutrients in that

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,620
ratio

421
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,778
the big thing is testing your leachate a

422
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,399
lot of the larger plant cultivators out

423
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,259
there will test the water that's

424
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,659
leaching out of their substrate so they

425
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,278
they can actually know hey this is too

426
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,919
high in phosphorus so we can lower our

427
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,419
phosphorus hey we can do this with that

428
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,278
barring that you really just have to

429
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,078
trust the ratios that the manufacturers

430
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,338
provided and then you have to make sure

431
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,019
you're just doing good watering and

432
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,959
fertigation practices like getting your

433
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,639
runoffs making sure that you're applying

434
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,679
evenly throughout your substrate things

435
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,899
like that that's pretty straightforward

436
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,719
let's not forget about organic

437
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,000
cultivators the folks that are adding in

438
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,860
organic inputs some people might be

439
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,299
listening to this and be like balance I

440
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,579
just add it on top and let the plan

441
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,500
uptake as it as it needs to yeah what

442
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,019
are your thoughts on that I mean is the

443
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,299
plan in fact uptaking what it needs when

444
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,278
it needs and leaving behind in the

445
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,620
medium what it doesn't need

446
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,600
technically yes I mean that's that's

447
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,899
what plants do you know but

448
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,940
with Organic production it's kind of uh

449
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,440
it's a slow burn it's like barbecue you

450
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,820
can't really know what you're putting on

451
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,220
the plant every day and what's being

452
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,019
taken up you're putting on basically as

453
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,360
much as you think you need for this for

454
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,740
a set amount of time and then in that

455
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,659
time you're hoping that your plant

456
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,459
doesn't run into a deficiency and by the

457
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,019
time you reapply you're hoping that you

458
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:46,078
don't have an accumulation of that

459
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,060
particular thing like say nitrogen so

460
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,519
with Organic production you you really

461
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,619
have to know your cultivars that's one

462
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,299
big thing like all these great producers

463
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,220
and tomato producers that are doing it

464
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,258
outdoors and organically they're doing

465
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,060
it with cultivars that they know exactly

466
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,980
how to run and they know exactly what

467
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,619
the nutritional needs are in the

468
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,539
different life stages so if if you know

469
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,279
your cultivars that well then it's

470
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,678
fairly easy to plan

471
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,619
your applications of organic nutrients

472
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,240
if not then you kind of again do like a

473
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,099
shotgun approach in your media where you

474
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,480
add as much as you think you need that

475
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,418
plant's going to need for a set amount

476
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,640
of time and then you reapply after that

477
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,079
time is expired ideally doing Leaf

478
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,780
tissue tests

479
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,519
a lot of um field agriculture they they

480
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,079
live and breathe off of leaf tissue

481
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,639
tests because that allows you to know

482
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,199
exactly what you need to put on and you

483
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,880
don't need to over apply which means you

484
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,919
don't need to overspend on fertilizers

485
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,179
so when it comes to organic production

486
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,280
you can kind of look at it the same way

487
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,980
where if you do a leaf tissue test maybe

488
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,538
once every one or like maybe once or

489
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,579
twice every growth cycle and just kind

490
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,558
of track how your nutrients are being

491
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,538
used in your media as you amend it

492
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,740
during your mix then you can know that

493
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,900
oh I need to add a little bit more

494
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,220
calcium sulfate or hey I need to add a

495
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,320
little bit more nitrogen during this

496
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,759
phase because my plants seem very hungry

497
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:04,379
so it would have to be it's a very time

498
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,819
intensive process if you don't have Leaf

499
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,860
tissue testing because you're just going

500
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,298
off of symptoms in the plant and just

501
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,399
kind of how you know that plant should

502
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:14,460
grow but if you you could speed that up

503
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,840
with with Leaf tissue testing and kind

504
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,000
of really dial in an organic program

505
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,099
almost as good as a conventional

506
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,859
agriculture salt program you mentioned

507
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,678
Leaf tissue testing but you don't

508
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,678
mention soil testing there's a reason

509
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,960
why you don't mention soil testing so

510
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,759
with Leaf tissue testing it's a little

511
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,740
bit more of a consistent picture of

512
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,720
what's in the soil because the plant is

513
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,259
taking it up and distributing it as it

514
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,319
sees fit with soil testing it's

515
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,240
It's Tricky especially in an organic

516
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,579
media that you've amended because if you

517
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,558
take a core sample and if you do a soil

518
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,839
test off of that that may not be

519
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:55,619
indicative of what's in that entire root

520
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,480
Zone also how you irrigate and what the

521
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,599
plants are sitting in whether it's a pot

522
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,179
or a bed is a big difference on how it

523
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,759
can affect nutrients either leaching

524
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:09,780
through and out or being used up by the

525
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,298
plant so typically we like to use the

526
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:15,000
liquids that either go onto and off of a

527
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,519
plant and then at that point you kind of

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,220
think of the media as more like a like a

529
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,079
buffer a sponge that's holding certain

530
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,000
amounts and with the right amendments

531
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,019
with the right CEC you'd expect it to

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,720
hold certain amounts of certain

533
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,279
nutrients so if you just measure what

534
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,500
you're putting on with what you're

535
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,019
putting out even in an organic setting

536
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,000
you can find you you're going to have a

537
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,679
ratio of uptake what's actually going

538
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,599
into the plant what's not coming out on

539
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,220
the leachate over time and then at that

540
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,439
point you can get a clear picture as

541
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,058
well okay that's interesting flipping

542
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,759
back to synthetic nutrients I have a

543
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,440
viewer question here which uh

544
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,319
it's kind of funny it's funny to me at

545
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,900
least which is uh if base nutrients have

546
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,480
a phosphorus and potassium in them our

547
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,280
PK boosters really necessary I know had

548
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,940
a couple people actually say that PK

549
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:05,160
boosters were just snake oil it's it's

550
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,279
mineral nutrition so it's phosphorus and

551
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,798
potassium so is it necessary well it

552
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,819
really depends on your nutrient program

553
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,859
so in

554
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,379
like for instance I would say that PK

555
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,019
boosters for certain cultivars would be

556
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,059
necessary especially if you're running a

557
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,798
very efficient fertigation program

558
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,359
because in an efficient fertigation

559
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,819
program you're not over applying

560
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,678
phosphorus and potassium definitely not

561
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,139
phosphorus at times where the plant

562
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,880
doesn't need too much phosphorus so you

563
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,120
would want the phosphorus to be right

564
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,820
within the ranges that you would expect

565
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,939
to find in healthy Leaf tissue tests

566
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:45,058
now certain cultivars may have a certain

567
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,400
point at which they do have a higher

568
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:49,980
than Baseline need for phosphorus and in

569
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,200
those situations having a PK boost that

570
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,700
you can do for maybe one to two weeks of

571
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,980
that plant's growth cycle when it really

572
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,480
needs that phosphorus boost would

573
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,099
definitely benefit because like I said

574
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,298
before you don't want that phosphorus to

575
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,879
be a bottleneck in the plant's

576
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,558
metabolism especially in those important

577
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,360
stages where there's a lot of secondary

578
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,038
metabolisms happening and we're making

579
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,079
all of our nice secondary metabolites

580
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,538
that we like so

581
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,119
there is definitely a need for PK

582
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,879
boosters I mean to tell you the truth

583
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,439
the most common PK booster that I that

584
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,660
we've used in the AG world is just

585
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,900
straight up monopotassium phosphate you

586
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,460
know it's 0 5234 doesn't get more PK

587
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,679
Boosty than that really there's

588
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,819
different versions like dipotassium

589
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,980
phosphate

590
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,599
um there's a product from ICL called PEC

591
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,839
acid which is basically a crystallized

592
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,298
phosphoric acid it's 0 60 20. but

593
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,819
there's plenty of

594
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:45,000
mineral nutrition Solutions in the AG

595
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:48,298
industry for PK boosts because that

596
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,819
requirement exists in plants to have

597
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:53,038
certain boosts of certain macronutrients

598
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:56,158
during growth stages where you don't

599
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,359
want to apply those high levels of those

600
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,740
um like phosphorus and potassium

601
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,240
throughout the entire growth cycle

602
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,058
because it's unnecessary

603
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,798
so yes PK boosters do have a place

604
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:06,298
but they have a place in a well

605
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,000
programmed and a well-planned

606
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:10,500
fertigation and fertilizer protocol yeah

607
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,079
I've heard from uh several different

608
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,480
people that a lot of these nutrient

609
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,099
companies are putting an excess amount

610
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,360
of phosphorus in there you know more

611
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:20,579
phosphorus is the plant is going to need

612
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,038
for its entire life are you seeing the

613
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:24,538
same thing have uh have there been any

614
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,339
companies that have kind of revised

615
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,099
their formula since those findings have

616
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,980
come out I think as you look at the

617
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,019
mineral salt programs that are coming

618
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,200
onto the market and are being revised on

619
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,519
the market you I like um there's a

620
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,960
couple of nutrient brands that I've been

621
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,579
watching you know for many years and

622
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,220
I've slowly seen the numbers of their

623
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,418
macros and micros to kind of evolve and

624
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,159
I think that's definitely where it's

625
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,960
going because a lot of these original

626
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,539
salt recipes are based on like tomato

627
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,579
formulas or cucumber formulas or cut

628
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,500
flower formulas none of them were

629
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,839
specifically made for you know medicinal

630
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:02,279
plants or you know specialty crops like

631
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:04,439
this so once the research is done on

632
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,359
what these specialty crops need then the

633
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,100
formulations of the nutrients will

634
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,798
follow now I'm really glad you mentioned

635
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,058
that about the feeding chart because I

636
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,158
remember back in the day when I first

637
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,379
started I was using Fox Farm nutrients

638
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,080
and if you look at their feeding chart

639
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,539
you'll see like the recommended ppms are

640
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,519
just out of control and a lot of people

641
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,558
don't know this but you had just

642
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,839
mentioned it is these formulas are

643
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,399
created for a wide variety of plants not

644
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,500
just medicinal plants

645
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,298
so a lot of folks you know you often

646
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,460
hear that it's recommended to start with

647
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:37,679
a half dose according to what the

648
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,140
feeding chart says that's why it's

649
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,840
because that nutrient line is probably

650
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,820
formulated for other plants besides

651
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,019
medicinal ones so right I'm glad you

652
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:48,658
mentioned that one

653
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:51,058
absolute and and newer cultivars or

654
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,980
older cultivars you know like the plants

655
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:53,819
are constantly evolving as we're growing

656
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,980
them you know because they're not

657
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,019
growing out in the wild so their needs

658
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,640
are going to evolve as well so it's so

659
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,500
that's why I think things like Leaf

660
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,240
tissue testing leache testing are so

661
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,279
important to really know what the

662
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,900
plant's eating you know unless you see

663
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,099
the plate after they're done eating you

664
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,320
don't really know what it liked or

665
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,240
didn't like you know so that that type

666
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,339
of analytical testing gives us that

667
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,620
window into what the plants really need

668
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:18,599
and allows us to dial it in that makes

669
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,739
sense organic input so I want to flip

670
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,259
back to that we're kind of going back

671
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,759
and forth back and forth here but it's

672
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,579
it's all good

673
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,579
the folks using organic inputs what

674
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,658
should they know prior to using them one

675
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:32,639
of the biggest things that I would

676
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,880
recommend is know where your Source

677
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,120
material comes from there's a lot of

678
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,940
kind of smaller organic soil producers

679
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,678
or media companies and you really want

680
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,120
to get companies that have vetted where

681
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,500
they're getting their Forest materials

682
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,558
from where they're getting their peat

683
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,179
from and obviously you want to look to

684
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:52,918
see if they're certified if they have

685
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,840
Armory certifications or any other sort

686
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,659
of like governing body certification to

687
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,339
show that they're organic

688
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,220
um barring that

689
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:04,980
it would really have to be like knowing

690
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,200
the consistency of your product as well

691
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,058
um media like I brought up isn't a is a

692
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,038
good example there could be a media

693
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,740
company that makes fantastic organic

694
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,480
media but if their supplier for Forest

695
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,798
material drops out then the media itself

696
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,620
can change and be completely different

697
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,139
so finding consistencies in that type of

698
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,058
an organic world is very challenging

699
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,440
definitely not as challenge or

700
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,480
definitely more challenging than the

701
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,580
mineral world where it's a it's a

702
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,140
chemical that has a certain number of

703
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,460
these molecules in that molecule and

704
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,679
that's it you know with an organic

705
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,778
there's so much involved in the

706
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,340
production and decomposition time and

707
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:40,919
all these things of the forest materials

708
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:43,500
and the peat and the Aging of that that

709
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,919
it's very hard for all those pieces to

710
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,740
line up all of the time exactly the way

711
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,140
that you expect and have expected it so

712
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,359
consistency would be the biggest driver

713
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,220
of looking for a source of any sort of

714
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,439
organic input like look at the

715
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,839
historical data see if they do

716
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,538
certificates of analysis like quarterly

717
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,058
weekly they'll just give them to you if

718
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:09,240
you request them

719
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:11,038
and yeah and and make sure that you're

720
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,839
following up on it because a lot of the

721
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,640
times people find a good organic input

722
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,500
and then they keep using it without

723
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,600
realizing that you know six months ago

724
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,579
they changed this or that that's why

725
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,740
everything's everything in their growth

726
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,899
has changed because of that change that

727
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,240
the formulation that was in the

728
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,919
formulation but they weren't privy to it

729
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,259
so you really have to stay on top of

730
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,419
your supply chain when you're using

731
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:36,000
organic inputs and look for products

732
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,860
that have known good consistency known

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,778
testing data things like that that's

734
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,579
really good advice I think a lot of

735
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:43,859
people these days are using the organic

736
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:46,019
Blends so the organic fertilize it's a

737
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,418
blend of different amendments and

738
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,400
they're typically doing the top dressing

739
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,659
right that's the the main way to do it

740
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,179
is the top dress or you can do the

741
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,440
initial amending of the soil to begin

742
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:57,120
but when the plant is growing in the

743
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,740
grow pot they're top dressing that

744
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,658
organic fertilizer and then they're

745
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,759
watering that in a lot of folks say

746
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,000
that's the easiest way to do it and you

747
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,819
can't overdo it however I'm hearing

748
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,278
otherwise that you can overdo it so can

749
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:13,678
you overdo it with Organics absolutely

750
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:17,159
you can absolutely over apply any

751
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,019
fertilizer to tell you the truth um it's

752
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,059
it's like uh it's like food you can

753
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,819
overeat anything you can even over drink

754
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:26,759
water and and plants are the same way

755
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,678
you it's harder obviously to overdose

756
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,019
your plants on a certain

757
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,278
um say phosphorus because it takes so

758
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,859
long typically for that to become

759
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,298
available in a root zone so unless you

760
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,038
do some sort of an egregious over

761
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:39,480
application of something like that then

762
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:41,879
you're you're typically not going to see

763
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,339
toxicity symptoms or any sort of like

764
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,760
ailments of the plant but certain things

765
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:50,399
like nitrogen calcium you know those can

766
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,460
be absolutely apparent when you do have

767
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,820
toxicity and the problem with Organic

768
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,980
agriculture too is

769
00:27:55,819 --> 00:28:00,899
remedying those problems say you know

770
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,298
you can absolutely over apply nitrogen

771
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,940
you you put triple the amount of fish

772
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,558
Emulsion you know into the root Zone you

773
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,298
start to get weird growth of like

774
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:11,278
pathogenic cultures you have this

775
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,720
overabundance of nitrogen going into the

776
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,940
plant the leaves are getting leathery

777
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,519
nitrogen Cycles getting weird within the

778
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,200
rhizosphere as well so you can get those

779
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,319
symptoms but how do you alleviate that

780
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,259
in rockwool with nitrates you just water

781
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,480
through maybe 30 minutes for about four

782
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,919
like 30 minute cycles for about like you

783
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,740
know four or five hours and then you can

784
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,179
be assured that that cube is well

785
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,859
flushed enough that your next

786
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,900
application of fertilizer will kind of

787
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,658
reset the balance in that with an

788
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,179
organic with a soil plot with you know

789
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,100
organic soils it's a lot more difficult

790
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,840
to alleviate those issues just because

791
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,639
of the fact that it's being immobilized

792
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,199
by the root zones ecology like the

793
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,179
things living in there it's being

794
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,700
immobilized by the types of substrate

795
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,200
that's in that so it can't leave that

796
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,980
substrate because it's stuck to the

797
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,140
particles in it and generally you'd have

798
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,298
to use things like maybe potassium

799
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,880
carbonate or activated charcoal or

800
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:07,619
things like that to kind of deal with

801
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,659
toxicities in your root Zone and kind of

802
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,158
help sequester sequester things but

803
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,840
you're never going to get the fast

804
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,860
bounce back that you would in like a

805
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,439
hydroponic situation so with Organic

806
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:22,619
inputs you can overuse them you just

807
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,600
have to make sure that you kind of do

808
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,579
the lowest application possible and move

809
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,740
up from there like I said with Organic

810
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,298
inputs and organic agriculture it's

811
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,399
really time intensive you have to know

812
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:33,778
your cultivars and if you're trying to

813
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,219
if you're trying to blast through them

814
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:36,659
and try to treat it like Hydroponics

815
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,940
you're going to be going back and forth

816
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,980
from either end so yeah start slow and

817
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,880
moving up and not over applying would be

818
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,278
the best

819
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,200
technique with uh organic agriculture

820
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,960
but yeah you can definitely over reply

821
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,720
that that's no question got it I want to

822
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,298
flip things over to pH pH is something

823
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,759
that is closely monitored by those folks

824
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:58,740
growing with synthetics a lot of people

825
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,298
that say you have to have that pH in

826
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,579
that certain range in order for the

827
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,319
plant to uptake now on the organic side

828
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:07,558
of things you hear a majority of people

829
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,058
saying they ignore pH completely what

830
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,639
are your thoughts on that

831
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,940
I think if they are growing organically

832
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,020
with healthy root zones they're

833
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,080
non-caring is well-founded you know the

834
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,418
roots on ecology is there to provide the

835
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,939
ideal conditions for that plant and if

836
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,700
it's set up correctly it will even in

837
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,080
Hydroponics we're starting to come

838
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,380
around most people are starting to come

839
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,058
around to the fact that it's not this

840
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,700
insanely precise range that you have to

841
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:37,678
be in it's a fairly wide range because

842
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,259
even in an inert setting like rock wool

843
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,820
you still have endogenous cultures like

844
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,158
cultures in the air that will land in

845
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:46,500
that root Zone and as they live and die

846
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,778
you know they acidify the area they do

847
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,759
cellular respiration and push out CO2 as

848
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:53,220
well which goes into the substrate water

849
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,220
and acidifies it so there's lots of

850
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,700
Pathways naturally for your media and

851
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,659
root Zone to balance its pH out

852
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,360
absolutely you don't want to water

853
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,419
outside of the range of maybe like six

854
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,199
to seven or like five to like seven and

855
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,960
a half

856
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,580
but within those ranges typically the

857
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
root Zone can recover as long as it's

858
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,960
not like a prolonged exposure to like a

859
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:18,000
a wild outlier or pH

860
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,740
when it comes to Mineral nutrition guys

861
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,700
you know obviously the lat phosphoric

862
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,319
acid or potassium hydroxide with Organic

863
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,640
production you can still do pH

864
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,619
adjustments

865
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,720
um pretty easily you add things like

866
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:34,019
dolomitic lime to the substrate if you

867
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,058
need a little bit more basicity

868
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,679
um there's certain fertilizers like down

869
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:39,960
to earth makes a good acid mix that's

870
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,940
acidifying you can even add things like

871
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,759
citric acid which you can buy Omri

872
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,038
listed and at a small rate with whatever

873
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,379
nutrient or top dress formula to add a

874
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,000
little bit of acidity sulfur products

875
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,100
are a great way to add a little bit of

876
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,859
acidity into your soil and kind of

877
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:58,259
increase that root Zone ecology so yeah

878
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:01,139
you need to adjust your pH in an inert

879
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:03,119
situation more and you definitely don't

880
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,278
have to worry about it as much in a soil

881
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,558
setting but it is important but just

882
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,898
know that if you have a healthy root

883
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,839
Zone ecology and your plants are set up

884
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:14,699
with a good substrate or media then the

885
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,918
pH will balance itself out as long as

886
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,500
you're not wildly out of the range of

887
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,360
typical like rain water or natural water

888
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,679
that we'd find standing on Earth so if

889
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:28,019
somebody's water sources over 7.5 pH and

890
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,840
they're growing with Organic inputs do

891
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,960
you recommend that they PH down that

892
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,480
water before doing the soil drench or

893
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,700
could they just add in that water that's

894
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,460
above 7.5 pH

895
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,140
that's a that's a tricky question you

896
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,179
know I want to know what else is in the

897
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,340
water you know if it's like carbonates

898
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,019
or if it's sodium carbs that sodium

899
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:52,379
bicarbonates or if it's just like

900
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:56,158
standard like typically if if your pH is

901
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,899
that high then that also means that your

902
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,360
um total dissolved solids are high too

903
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:02,939
so I'd really want to take a look at the

904
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:07,798
quality of your well water at that point

905
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,778
um if it's just like say calcium and uh

906
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:12,839
and other kind of beneficial kind of

907
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:15,240
secondaries that are and it's just a

908
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,278
bunch of bicarbonate bringing it up

909
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,159
as long as you've amended your bed

910
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,079
correctly there should be no problem if

911
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,820
you know like say the water has this

912
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,379
amount of bicarbonate in it and you're

913
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,538
going to apply this much water to that

914
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,700
land then you should maybe know how much

915
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,259
sulfur you want to amend to that bed so

916
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,700
that over the course of that watering

917
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,740
year you know you're going to have

918
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,720
enough of a buffering capacity naturally

919
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,240
built into that soil things like things

920
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,460
like that are considerations you have to

921
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,740
do before and after even the watering

922
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,058
happens to answer something like that I

923
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,819
feel yeah it's hard to go round about

924
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:51,658
and not answer your question no that's

925
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:54,319
fine I I uh that topic in particular is

926
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,500
super controversial I mean I had

927
00:33:54,319 --> 00:34:00,119
mentioned to lower the pH in the past in

928
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,579
one of my videos and there was just an

929
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,459
uproar of people growing organic they're

930
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:07,678
like PH down doesn't exist in nature and

931
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,780
blah blah blah so there's a lot of

932
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,300
organic Growers that actually do have a

933
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,460
water source above 7.5 and they're just

934
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,859
putting in their soil and apparently not

935
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,179
having issues so I figured I'd ask that

936
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:20,338
you know get your thoughts on that one

937
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,898
yeah it really depends on the soil and

938
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:24,539
how things how you're watering things

939
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,338
like that absolutely now how about EC or

940
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:28,320
PPM this is another thing that when

941
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:31,799
you're growing with synthetic nutrients

942
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,019
people tend to monitor more closely than

943
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,940
growing Organics do you think when

944
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,559
growing Organics you should just be

945
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,539
completely hands off when it comes to

946
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,460
the EC and PPM or do you think that

947
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:43,440
should be monitored as well you know

948
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,720
it's difficult in like row AG things

949
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,659
like that but if you're doing organic

950
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,618
agriculture in pots or in containers

951
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,960
then absolutely I would monitor the EC

952
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,940
of what you're what you're putting on

953
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,358
and what you're what's coming off of the

954
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,159
plants that's really going to tell you

955
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,838
um basically what's going to the plant

956
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,358
because it's basically a simple math

957
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,679
equation you have this much nitrates and

958
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,179
then you put it on the plant and then at

959
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,219
the end when you're watering you have

960
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,559
this much nitrates so maybe in the

961
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,939
course of a couple of days you you take

962
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,799
the average of those numbers and you say

963
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,099
like oh yeah so it's using this much

964
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,260
nitrate so that it can be just as useful

965
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,480
in a soil world as it is of hydroponic

966
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,660
you can control it the you can control

967
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,039
the inputs a lot more precisely in

968
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,719
Hydroponics

969
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,880
um it's going to be a little bit more of

970
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,939
a longer wave function when it comes to

971
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,099
your Corrections in organic agriculture

972
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,599
but the potential to make those

973
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,519
Corrections are still there so

974
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,200
monitoring your ECS is very important

975
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,380
especially if you're doing like you said

976
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,699
well water with like 7.5 pH because like

977
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,260
I said that probably means you have a

978
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:51,179
ton of dissolved solids in there as well

979
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,099
and if you have a ton of dissolved

980
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:55,858
solids you want to make sure that you're

981
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,559
not over applying the salty probably

982
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:01,440
calcium or maybe even sodium Laden water

983
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,880
onto an organic bed so there's a lot of

984
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,380
different little considerations when it

985
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,800
comes to

986
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,079
um like the EC and what that EC is made

987
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,660
of and that's why we don't that's why I

988
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,880
typically don't recommend people use PPM

989
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:16,440
as a measurement of nutrient

990
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,780
concentration in their solution because

991
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,639
I mean what scale is it first of all are

992
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,980
you using the 500 or the 700 scale what

993
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,960
size particle like and are you using a

994
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,400
blue lab meter are you using an EC meter

995
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,838
to measure that PPM because all it's

996
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,960
doing is taking the EC data and

997
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,659
multiplying it by number you know so PPM

998
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,880
is very hard to judge the the true

999
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,338
measure of uh like a PPM number would be

1000
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,380
to take that liquid go get it analyzed

1001
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:42,480
and then find out exactly what's in it

1002
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,358
at what concentrations

1003
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,219
so we don't like to use PPM EC is is

1004
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,619
just electrical conductivity how much

1005
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:52,139
salt is in this solution how much ionic

1006
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,720
bonds got broken into this liquid and

1007
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:57,598
that is I think a better indicator of

1008
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:00,000
plant Health plant Health on the fly or

1009
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,280
roots on Health on the Fly and then once

1010
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,199
your EC ranges are out of range that's

1011
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,599
when you can really like take that water

1012
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,338
and get it tested you know ideally you

1013
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,500
would do periodic testing anyway but

1014
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:12,239
that EC is going to be a simpler

1015
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,099
indicator and if you know what's going

1016
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,439
on your plants and your plants are

1017
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:19,440
growing then you can kind of assume that

1018
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,838
it's taking up at least a minimum of the

1019
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,119
balanced nutrition in order to grow so

1020
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,279
you can kind of assume that what your

1021
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,740
lead shape is going to come out as is

1022
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,240
typically going to be balanced as soon

1023
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,098
as you start to see deficiencies or you

1024
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,259
start to see issues and uptake you do

1025
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,480
that leachate test and if you're still

1026
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,540
within like a healthy leachate EC range

1027
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,159
of maybe 0.3 or three to seven then you

1028
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,159
take that water into for testing and you

1029
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,500
go oh this is only 0.5 EC but it's like

1030
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,239
literally all phosphorus in there so we

1031
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,820
need to really dial back the phosphorus

1032
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,559
dial everything else up a little bit and

1033
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,900
then do a leachate test on a different

1034
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,699
pot a couple days later and then see

1035
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,260
where we're at at that point and then

1036
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:59,939
you can kind of see that your number is

1037
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,859
balancing out your phosphate leachate

1038
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,240
goes down and it balances out with all

1039
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,920
your other macronutrients that you

1040
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,679
should expect to fall out in healthy

1041
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,559
Roots so yeah easy measuring and

1042
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,899
monitoring absolutely is is critical in

1043
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,500
both regular conventional uh Hydroponics

1044
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:19,079
or in conventional like soil or uh yeah

1045
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,358
like container soil grows

1046
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,079
it's harder to measure of course in like

1047
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,759
row agriculture usually just um you go

1048
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,039
at scale and you let a rip for those

1049
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,020
guys you you do soil tests beforehand

1050
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,820
you make all the necessary calculations

1051
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,800
you plan your applications and yeah you

1052
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,660
just set it on autopilot you Let It Rip

1053
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,339
but in a controlled environment where

1054
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:40,559
you can control your inputs whether it's

1055
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:42,960
in soil and pots or rock wool or any

1056
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,480
inert substrate having that EC input

1057
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,280
output readout is is extremely helpful

1058
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,980
and critical in dialing in a nutrient

1059
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,740
program understood for the record I was

1060
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,139
born and raised on PPM measurements uh

1061
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,879
should uh should probably switch over to

1062
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,980
UC

1063
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,420
simpler man just it's got two numbers

1064
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,760
that's all you need and then decimal

1065
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,579
decimal point sometimes yeah that's

1066
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,619
funny I want to Circle back to balance I

1067
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:10,859
mean we've mentioned that quite a few

1068
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,780
times throughout this episode and we

1069
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:15,480
know that things need to be balanced in

1070
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,220
the medium if you have in excess of some

1071
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,740
cations it can lock out other cations

1072
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:22,919
for example right what are some of the

1073
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:25,679
most common lockouts that are out there

1074
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,019
and how do people resolve these lockouts

1075
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,519
and prevent them from happening it's um

1076
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:32,159
it really depends on how you're growing

1077
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:35,699
so if you're in a hydroponic inert media

1078
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,739
a lot of these like lockout or imbalance

1079
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:39,480
situations can be really corrected on

1080
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,819
the Fly just by flushing the substrate

1081
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,800
out rockwool of course is going to be

1082
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,640
the easiest or some sort of uh you know

1083
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,560
expanded glass but even in Coco coir or

1084
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,118
even in Pete you can you can flush it

1085
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,119
you can flush your substrates through

1086
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,240
and kind of reset and start reapplying

1087
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,858
your base formula to kind of reset at

1088
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,139
that media

1089
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:02,699
when it comes to like I mentioned

1090
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,440
earlier in a soil substrate it's a

1091
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,779
little bit harder because you have

1092
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,139
different particulates that hold on to

1093
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,780
different ions they promote different

1094
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,879
cultures growing in the media which can

1095
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,339
also hold on to different nutrients so

1096
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,260
when it comes to maybe preventing a

1097
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:21,480
lockout or or trying to at least

1098
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,579
diagnose a lockout one thing that we

1099
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,219
usually recommend is look at your

1100
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,960
environmental data first so a lot of the

1101
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:30,118
times we've seen lockouts can happen

1102
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,519
from environments being too cold too wet

1103
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,320
not enough light things like that if all

1104
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,659
of your environmental data is good then

1105
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,400
at that point I you and at the same time

1106
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:41,039
you probably want to dial your nutrient

1107
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,440
program just back just simply back and

1108
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,420
then start doing leachate testing once

1109
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,338
you dial your nutrient program back then

1110
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,099
you can kind of be assured that you're

1111
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,719
not locking anything out and you're that

1112
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,820
increased volume of water is maybe

1113
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,098
flushing out something that maybe have

1114
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,200
may have been accumulating and then at

1115
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,420
that point you can kind of

1116
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:03,059
get your Leaf tissue tests or kind of

1117
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,619
get a baseline idea of what's in your

1118
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:07,920
substrate as you're applying new

1119
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,619
fertilizer solution and and see if that

1120
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,760
deficiency comes back a lot of the times

1121
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:17,400
we've seen like deficiencies arise from

1122
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,220
fertigation techniques like how the

1123
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,139
fertilizers are being applied more so

1124
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,578
than the concentration of the

1125
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,739
fertilizers themselves especially

1126
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,519
nowadays with all of these formulations

1127
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:32,279
kind of getting dialed in more and more

1128
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:34,559
it's not like Growers are putting too

1129
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,440
much calcium and it's locking out the

1130
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,719
phosphorus it's more about like Growers

1131
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,280
are putting too much of everything and

1132
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,739
they're watering too many times a day

1133
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,560
and so the root zone is either

1134
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:48,779
waterlogged or their watering periods

1135
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,659
are too far apart and they have too hard

1136
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:55,019
of a dry back and that can really kind

1137
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,819
of upset the uptake kind of balance

1138
00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:00,780
within the root Zone as it prunes itself

1139
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,240
and has to grow back new new shoots so

1140
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,339
the the General Health of the plan is

1141
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:08,098
going to kind of like in my opinion

1142
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:11,219
comes down to knowing the Baseline of

1143
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,440
how that cultivar grows and then knowing

1144
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:16,139
that you know you're applying a certain

1145
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,880
amount of blank so if you dial that back

1146
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:20,819
then you can't be over applying anything

1147
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,200
and then from there like for me I would

1148
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,940
do the leaf tissue testing if that's not

1149
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,739
available at that point you'd see if

1150
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,200
that deficiency persists and if other

1151
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:30,419
deficiencies come out arise you dial

1152
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,460
your nutrient program back up and then

1153
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,380
you you'd see if it was an environmental

1154
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,780
factor or if it was in fact a nutrient

1155
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,579
Factor if it's very obvious like one

1156
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,160
thing that I've seen very obviously is

1157
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,960
magnesium you start to get that

1158
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,299
intravenal chlorosis on the leaves

1159
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,699
things like that and a lot of the times

1160
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,560
guys will increase their magnesium and

1161
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:51,118
it's just doesn't get doesn't improve

1162
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,679
and then you find out like they don't

1163
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,900
ever have dry back in their root zones

1164
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,879
they're using like a a plastic pot

1165
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,160
without any drainage so

1166
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,380
it a lot of the times we've seen a lot

1167
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,239
of these um lockout issues go back to

1168
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,099
environmental factors and just growth

1169
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,618
environment of the plant

1170
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,260
if you do have a nutrient kind of

1171
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,440
imbalance in Hydro you usually flush and

1172
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,839
reset in soil you have to

1173
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,940
amend with

1174
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,219
yeah it's difficult in soil you'd have

1175
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,380
to add if it's a product that can be

1176
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:25,259
sequestered by activated charcoal you

1177
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,599
can do that barring that heavy flushes

1178
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,800
with water work too but you know you're

1179
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,019
going to stress the plant out a lot

1180
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,818
doing that whereas in a inert media

1181
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:33,900
typically you get faster try back so

1182
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,039
it's not going to stress the plant out

1183
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,220
too much

1184
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,019
I hope that answers that question yeah

1185
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:41,699
lots of good information for sure one

1186
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,380
thing actually made me think of another

1187
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:46,379
question which is you mentioned

1188
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,838
environment and temperature can you talk

1189
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,039
to us about how the temperature the

1190
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:51,838
varying of temperature you know whether

1191
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:54,659
the temperature be too high or too low

1192
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:58,199
how that impacts nutrition and nutrient

1193
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:59,940
uptake absolutely like you know this is

1194
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,939
a big thing that happened when everyone

1195
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,318
switched from HIDs to LEDs they've

1196
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,880
realized they had to change their

1197
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,039
nutrient programs they had to change

1198
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,500
their room parameters because the rooms

1199
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:13,619
are less hot so heat in and of itself is

1200
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,719
energy too so not only do you need the

1201
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,519
light energy to drive photosynthesis but

1202
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,618
of the kinetic energy from the heat of

1203
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,420
the room moves the water molecules in

1204
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,640
the room and helps those processes out

1205
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,619
as well you know it's almost like a

1206
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,838
catalyst in all of those processes so

1207
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,420
heat definitely plays a factor in the

1208
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,460
transpiration rate it triggers stress

1209
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,980
responses and and kind of growth

1210
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,858
responses in the plant so if your rooms

1211
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,480
are too cold or if they're honestly too

1212
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:41,578
cold or too hot you're going to have

1213
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,838
interruptions in in the metabolism of

1214
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,700
the plant which is going to interrupt

1215
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,400
the uptake of the plant and once you get

1216
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:49,500
an interruption in the uptake you're

1217
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,019
continually applying so that's when you

1218
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,239
start to get the issues of if this plant

1219
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:56,099
is locked out because it's dry for half

1220
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,259
of the day and you start to keep

1221
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:00,000
applying more it's not going to use up

1222
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,339
all of those nutrients during that day

1223
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,199
while the light is hitting it so like

1224
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,239
the environmental factories your soil

1225
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,879
moisture content and you know the

1226
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,279
temperature of the room have a huge key

1227
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,838
to have a huge role to play in the

1228
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,420
nutrient uptake and transpiration

1229
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:17,460
ability of your plants so yeah like I

1230
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,019
said if you're if you're too cold the

1231
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,780
plants really don't have enough energy

1232
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,699
to move a lot of water through uh also

1233
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,839
the water itself has is low energy so it

1234
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,879
doesn't really want to move up and

1235
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,679
through the plant as well if it's too

1236
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,720
hot then you have too much water

1237
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,598
transpiring out a lot of the times if

1238
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,598
it's too hot your root zones get um

1239
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,640
any uneven dry back or too much dry back

1240
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,380
and that can stop the uptake of water

1241
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,500
which stops the uptake of nutrients

1242
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,660
which also at that point starts to get

1243
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,880
accumulation in your root Zone and then

1244
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,739
your easy starts to spike once your EC

1245
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,358
spikes and your EC gets too salty then

1246
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,338
the root zone is too salty for uptake

1247
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,960
that affects your uptake immensely

1248
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:57,179
that's when you start to see a really

1249
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,940
spindly plants with the tiny golf balls

1250
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,919
just going down the stem when it comes

1251
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,139
to medicinal plants for like in a tomato

1252
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,700
plant you get these tiny small fruits

1253
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:09,838
you know so

1254
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:13,980
the EC controls a lot of how your plant

1255
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,679
grows and the EC is really a function of

1256
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,000
the water content in the soil too so the

1257
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,940
water content

1258
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,619
itself is kind of

1259
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,599
um affected by the environmental

1260
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,818
conditions like the temperature and the

1261
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,800
irrigation frequency things like that so

1262
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:30,179
yeah your environmental factors like

1263
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,280
like I said when it goes back to

1264
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:34,139
deficiencies or nutrient problems we

1265
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,200
always Circle first to your environment

1266
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:38,818
to see if your environment is good if

1267
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,179
that's not the case then a lot of the

1268
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:44,818
times changes in the environment will

1269
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:46,559
correct or increase the uptake within

1270
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:49,500
the root Zone and then they can get back

1271
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:52,318
onto their kind of Nutri their standard

1272
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,239
nutrition program as as they planned it

1273
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,679
so what's the ideal temperature range to

1274
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,598
keep your environment you know it's

1275
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,039
cultivar dependence um especially for

1276
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,780
medicinal plants but it's anywhere

1277
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,960
within the ranges of like

1278
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,300
65 all the way up to 85.

1279
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,559
um you know that magic VPD number comes

1280
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,180
in when it comes to those types of

1281
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:10,318
outlier temperatures you really want to

1282
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:12,118
monitor your humidity in those

1283
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,519
temperatures and again cultivar

1284
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,700
dependent certain cultivars do great in

1285
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:19,500
65 certain cultivars don't grow in 65.

1286
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,618
certain cultivars

1287
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,260
stunt out and they don't grow at 85.

1288
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,720
certain cultivares veg out and Bush like

1289
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,240
crazy in 85. so I would say it's

1290
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,578
definitely cultivar dependent but um the

1291
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,139
ranges for like our most common

1292
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:37,740
medicinal plants would be anywhere from

1293
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:40,259
like 65 to about 85. and life cycle

1294
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:42,299
plays a huge part in that absolutely

1295
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,000
because because temperature also you're

1296
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,880
you're trying to mimic the natural

1297
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,559
temperature cycle for an annual plant so

1298
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,079
of course in those earlier spring and

1299
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,019
summer months the veg months you'd have

1300
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,880
higher temperatures and in the flower

1301
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,380
senescence months in the Harvest months

1302
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,400
you definitely have cooler temperatures

1303
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:04,140
and the the inner metabolisms within the

1304
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,400
plant are triggered by those changes in

1305
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,799
temperatures as well so it's important

1306
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,838
to consider the temperature shift within

1307
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,339
a growth cycle of medicinal plants as

1308
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,078
well as just the Baseline temperature

1309
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:14,219
that's good to know so there's a

1310
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:15,839
different type of feeding that I want to

1311
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:17,818
touch on you know a lot of people will

1312
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,818
mix in their synthetic nutrients into

1313
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:22,500
water then do a soil drench other folks

1314
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:25,199
will do a top dressing of organic inputs

1315
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,000
for example and then they'll water them

1316
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,338
in however there's another way to go

1317
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,500
about feeding which is foliar feeding

1318
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:33,539
talk to us about how foliar feeding

1319
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,739
works and what type of folio feeding can

1320
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,380
Growers do

1321
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:39,118
folder feeding is basically

1322
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,440
trying to

1323
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,660
directly apply mineral nutrition to the

1324
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,000
parts of the plant that seemingly need

1325
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:49,440
it that can't get translocated from

1326
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,300
other parts of the plant or it's not

1327
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,818
getting from the root Zone

1328
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,560
you know I we definitely have I

1329
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:57,420
definitely have an opinion about foliar

1330
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,159
applications of mineral nutrition

1331
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,720
especially

1332
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,719
um it's kind of like uh

1333
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:07,019
it's not something that I believe

1334
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,500
Growers should lean on for their

1335
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:13,139
nutrition program it's definitely a just

1336
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,318
a general part of any part of crop

1337
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,539
cultivation but it's it's kind of like

1338
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,358
um you you'd want to feed a child a

1339
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:24,358
fully balanced nutrition from the get-go

1340
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,400
into his mouth you don't want to feed

1341
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:27,719
him only macaroni and cheese and then he

1342
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,818
gets scurvy and then you got to take him

1343
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,578
to the doctor to get a direct injection

1344
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:34,920
of vitamin C every month and that's kind

1345
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,780
of if you if you consider having a

1346
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,579
constant foliar feed program that's kind

1347
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,859
of the type of nutrition program you're

1348
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:43,560
planning out for your plants you want

1349
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,779
that nutrition to come because we're not

1350
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,159
growing orchids or you know like plants

1351
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,960
that are growing up in tree canopies

1352
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:51,358
we're growing plants with full root

1353
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,900
zones and root systems so we want to

1354
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:57,480
deliver their nutrition that way the the

1355
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,480
more conventional way the way that is

1356
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,519
kind of a pathway laid out by the plant

1357
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,699
rather than using Fuller applications a

1358
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,380
lot of the times Fuller applications

1359
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:09,659
applications would come when

1360
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,579
that Baseline nutrition program seems to

1361
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:13,739
have a deficiency and when you

1362
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:16,920
specifically identify that deficiency

1363
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:19,199
whether it is uh calcium or magnesium or

1364
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,420
this or that a zinc for example is

1365
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,519
actually common in medicinal plants if

1366
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,280
you find those specific deficiencies

1367
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:29,099
then yeah a folio application is an

1368
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,260
absolute Powerhouse tool to get that

1369
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,359
mineral nutrition directly onto those

1370
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,420
areas of the plant where that particular

1371
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,279
nutrient can't get translocated up into

1372
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,780
from the other tissues of the plant but

1373
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,640
barring that

1374
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,400
you know Fuller applications especially

1375
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:46,440
on an like an ornamental plant or a cut

1376
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,200
flower product like medicinal plants

1377
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,300
typically are you want to reduce any

1378
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,578
application of any product to the plant

1379
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,800
especially after influences have said

1380
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,720
after after flowers are there because

1381
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,420
you know that's that is the end product

1382
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:03,118
and anything that you add exogenously

1383
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,920
can typically degrade or Denude the

1384
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,200
quality of that product so you don't

1385
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,599
want to apply as you want to reduce

1386
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,399
applications as much as possible that's

1387
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,559
why beneficial insects or beneficial

1388
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,480
mites are so great they allow you to

1389
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,579
have good pest control over under over

1390
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,740
threshold numbers without any

1391
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,019
applications of sprays or anything and

1392
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:23,699
there's no possible possible problem of

1393
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:25,679
France or anything like that so that's

1394
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:28,078
why I think BCAAs are taking over on the

1395
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:30,719
IPM side and when it comes to folder

1396
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,818
applications were in my opinion seeing

1397
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,558
less products Market themselves as

1398
00:51:32,818 --> 00:51:37,500
Fuller products and a lot of products

1399
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:41,579
kind of try to roll all of that value

1400
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:43,318
into their mineral nutrition there is um

1401
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,079
there are certain foliar products

1402
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:48,239
especially amino acids that we found

1403
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,220
that are not part of a mineral nutrition

1404
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,338
program but do actually have added

1405
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:55,019
benefits a lot of the times we see it a

1406
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:57,838
lot in turf or when I was in the AG

1407
00:51:55,019 --> 00:52:00,000
world we saw it a lot in Turf like

1408
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,338
um there's a certain Amino Proline for

1409
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,599
example you spray that on grass and that

1410
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:05,338
helps trigger pressure and all the

1411
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,440
blades stand straight up you know so

1412
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:10,078
we're finding that there are other

1413
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,720
products that we can apply to the plants

1414
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,300
foliarly that would give the benefits of

1415
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,459
that we couldn't really get through a

1416
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,720
nutrition program in the root Zone and

1417
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,119
those are the products that I'd probably

1418
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,919
suggest if you wanted to do a full year

1419
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,680
program you rolled those into a full

1420
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,780
year program with some base IPM products

1421
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,419
but also know that full your products

1422
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,640
work best with adjuvants so if you don't

1423
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,039
have like a spreader sticker like a

1424
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,420
organic silicone

1425
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:38,759
adjuvant if you if you don't have like

1426
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,980
even like an acid chelator or something

1427
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,140
like that say the pH of your foliar

1428
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,539
spray is off off or you're not agitating

1429
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:48,838
as like there's a lot of considerations

1430
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:51,000
that you have to lock in for a full year

1431
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,920
program to be truly effective

1432
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,838
once those things are locked in and

1433
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,079
you've truly found a product that works

1434
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,139
best as a failure application good on

1435
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,720
you go nuts but in my opinion foliar

1436
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:05,639
nutrition is is

1437
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,039
um yeah it's a shot in the arm when it

1438
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,299
should have been just part of the meal

1439
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,699
interesting yeah I think the only time I

1440
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,460
ever really do foliar feeding is when I

1441
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,139
have magnesium deficiency and I'm in veg

1442
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,380
like I don't spray in flour but

1443
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:22,019
magnesium deficiency and veg I use epsom

1444
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,660
salt so magnesium sulfate put that into

1445
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:27,239
water spray the plants and that helps

1446
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:29,399
with the magnesium deficiency I do know

1447
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:31,679
some people who will do a foliar feeding

1448
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,900
of silica not so much that it goes into

1449
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,699
the plant that way but I believe that it

1450
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,800
helps with some resistance to Pottery

1451
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,480
mildew in particular I don't have too

1452
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,640
many details on that one and I know some

1453
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,400
folks that will use they'll actually

1454
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:47,039
foliar feed compost tea so for micro

1455
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,838
purposes yeah to to get those

1456
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:49,980
lactobacillus cultures in there get

1457
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:51,779
those healthy cultures on there

1458
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,480
absolutely that makes sense as long as

1459
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,040
you're doing it at a uh kind of a sane

1460
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,079
rate that really doesn't affect the

1461
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,659
quality of the plant

1462
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,619
um silica obviously that's been done for

1463
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:04,019
quite a while

1464
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:06,300
um that's that directly if if it's small

1465
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:08,519
enough can kind of go through into the

1466
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,019
plant and be absorbed fully and I was

1467
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,719
just going to say with the magnesium

1468
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:14,880
sulfate too you can failure that but you

1469
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,039
know you could you could simply top

1470
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,180
dress a little bit too and then you'd

1471
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,699
probably get the same results in about

1472
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:22,139
three or four days and uh you can even

1473
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:24,239
add a little bit more to your

1474
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:27,838
fertigation program as kind of a last

1475
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:30,659
step Amendment to the batch tank it'll

1476
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:32,519
melt down easily easily enough if it's

1477
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:35,879
magnesium sulfate and it really doesn't

1478
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,079
affect your ppms too much so that that's

1479
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,940
something that you could do as well so

1480
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,380
there like I said there's other ways to

1481
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,119
to get those benefits without risking

1482
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,800
someone maybe doing a improper

1483
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,680
application or over applying something

1484
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,359
fully early good points so we are coming

1485
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,279
up towards the end of the episode I want

1486
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,838
to give you an opportunity to let us

1487
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,220
know what else should gardeners know

1488
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,838
about Plant Nutrition is there anything

1489
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:59,818
that we didn't cover in this episode

1490
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,338
that you think we should cover

1491
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:03,960
you know one thing that I that I've kind

1492
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,179
of wanted to scream from the rooftops a

1493
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,460
lot is um you know your mineral

1494
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:12,598
nutrition your your nitrates your

1495
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:16,139
phosphorus your potassium that is the

1496
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:19,200
same molecule regardless of bottle salt

1497
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:21,659
brand country of origin all of that so

1498
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:24,000
it really comes down to understanding

1499
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:26,098
what you put on your plants more than

1500
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,858
kind of

1501
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,559
in my opinion um trusting a product at

1502
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:33,960
this point back in the day there was no

1503
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,880
information about medicinal plants no

1504
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,400
information about certain specialty

1505
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,240
crops that we could go off of and have

1506
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,920
kind of historical data to to see if

1507
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,439
we're within ranges for certain things

1508
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,480
now that that information is being found

1509
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,639
out in places like Canada and like even

1510
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,800
here in the U.S that type of information

1511
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,838
needs to be applied you know like like I

1512
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,300
said I come from the AG industry I come

1513
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,619
from the AG world and and there's not a

1514
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,200
cotton Farmer in the world that would

1515
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:03,358
overspend on a nitrogen molecule you

1516
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,818
know they they sometimes they make you

1517
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,920
know like less than 100 bucks per acre

1518
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:10,139
on their cotton so it's like it's it's

1519
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,220
tough out there in the AG world and I

1520
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:14,219
think

1521
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:16,739
that is also a really good point in

1522
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:18,058
sustainability too we have to make sure

1523
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:20,578
that we're not following the same

1524
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,680
mistakes of Ag and from the get-go we're

1525
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:24,660
trying to be as efficient as possible

1526
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,639
with our nutrient delivery so that we're

1527
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,318
not setting a bad example like it needs

1528
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,299
to be done properly with the right

1529
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,818
science and that starts with people

1530
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,519
understanding just the basic science of

1531
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:37,980
how plants take up mineral nutrition how

1532
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,318
what the basic needs are for plants you

1533
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,059
know very similar to us they need

1534
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,679
three big things and then all the

1535
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,480
vitamins so we just need to find the

1536
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,659
right balance of those and then find the

1537
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,099
right way to deliver that and uh yeah we

1538
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,179
shouldn't be too hung up on Brands and

1539
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,280
stuff we should just try to find the

1540
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:54,838
best way to mishmash everything to make

1541
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,579
things work and try to be the most

1542
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:58,558
efficient as possible I think that's

1543
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,300
some really really good advice

1544
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,040
so let's wrap things up how can the

1545
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,440
listeners find you and what do you have

1546
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,539
upcoming in the future uh I should be

1547
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,700
you should see me in a couple more um

1548
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,500
can of cribs and Deep Roots episodes on

1549
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:11,639
The Growers Network YouTube channel

1550
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,199
um definitely helping them out with a

1551
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,519
lot of that stuff I'm helping them on

1552
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,279
the back end

1553
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:20,159
um with their plant science info you can

1554
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,380
check me out directly at canacribs.org

1555

picture of me uh if anyone has any

1558
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,179
questions about cultivation or

1559
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,619
cultivation at scale there's a form that

1560
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:33,419
they could fill out and you'd be happy

to sit down and talk with me I learned

1565
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:46,260
so much from this you explain things

1566
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:49,500

00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:56,760
conversation or even go towards some

1571
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,059
other areas we have a lot of knowledge

1572
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,680
of such as IPM sure yeah I'd be happy to
