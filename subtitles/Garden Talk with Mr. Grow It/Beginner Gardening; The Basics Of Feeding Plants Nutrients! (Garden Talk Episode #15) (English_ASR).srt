4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
that i

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,439
have run i've basically started off with

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,280
a quarter to a half so when i'm

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,600
transplanting i basically just do my

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,879
bottom layer of soil and then where i'm

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
going to transplant in

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,879

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,880
mycos right on top of there

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,118
you don't have to even use very much

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,518
just look at your plants

14

of just

121

uh ingrained that in me as a little

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
child it was kind of my punishment and

123
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
go out and weed the garden

124
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
well that wasn't a punishment for me

125
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,119
actually i kind of enjoyed it

126
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,280
so i've always been a gardener and

127
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,039
i started growing medicinal plants about

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400

140
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,359
in my garden

141
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360

i uh

150
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
found medicinal plants at an early age

151
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,560
because of

152
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
chronic migraines and i just have really

153
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
been

154
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,040
um a proponent of it ever since and

155
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,319
you know it just has been something that

156
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
i've been looking at doing

157
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,159
professionally

158
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,680
so um yeah that's a little bit about me

159
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,240
and and i can now be found uh the guys

160
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,800
from michigan bros grow show

161

and and uh yeah it's really been uh

171
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,000
fun and i can't even i can't even

172
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,519
begin to tell you how beneficial it's

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,519
been in my life so

174
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,799
the gardening and everything about it

175
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,639
and so

176
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
yeah it's it's been fantastic and i

177
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
can't wait to

178
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,599
keep doing this and hope to do it

179
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
professionally sometime soon

180
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,840
that's cool one of the things in that

181
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,399
podcast that really stuck out to me is

182
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,799
that you've

183
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,918
used a whole bunch of different types of

184
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
nutrients

185
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,399
that kind of prompted this interview

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,680
here is or discussion whatever

187
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,439
um to talk about you know what the topic

188
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,879
is today which is the basics of feeding

189
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,399
plants nutrients

190
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,719
there are several different types of

191
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,959
nutrients out there right there's

192
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,039
synthetic and there's organic now some

193
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,519
people might look at the title of this

194
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,360
video

195
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,959
which is the basics of feeding plants

196
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
nutrients and they might say

197
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,918
feed the soil not feed the plant

198
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,079
right so there is actually such thing as

199
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,079
feeding the plant and there is actually

200
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,318
a such thing as feeding the soil right

201
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,359
so that's when we talk about synthetic

202
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,600
versus organic so synthetic nutrients

203
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,038
most bottled lines i believe are

204
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
synthetic nutrients

205
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,038
they're smaller molecules and basically

206
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
when you're mixing those nutrients into

207
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,240
water

208
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,119
um you know they're water soluble

209
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,199
they're in a

210
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
plant available form so the plant can

211
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,840
immediately uptake those nutrients

212
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
you're feeding the plant in that sense

213
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,719
organic on the other hand

214
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,120
organic inputs organic amendments

215
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,599
that's not in a form that's immediately

216
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,639
available for the plant right so

217
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,038
what needs to happen first is the

218
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
microbial life in the soil needs to

219
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,639
break down those inputs

220
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,400
and put them into that plant available

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,639
form so they'll

222
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,679
break down or they'll eat those

223
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,439
amendments

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
crap them out right and then they're

225
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:22,160
kind of in that plant available

226
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:25,198
form that can be uptaken by the plant so

227
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
there's a little bit of a delay i guess

228
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
you can

229
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,279
kind of say is you know the synthetic

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
nutrients are immediately

231
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,478
immediately available for the plant they

232
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,400
can uptake it right away if you're

233
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,318
coming across a deficiency

234
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
there should be a pretty decent there's

235
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,439
going to be a quicker recovery off of

236
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,279
synthetic nutrients than organics

237
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,959
because organics you need to

238
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,318
it needs to be broken down by those

239
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,638
microbes first

240
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
so it takes a little bit longer so

241
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
feeding the plant

242
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,198
versus feeding the soil so that being

243
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
said

244
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,360
uh do you grow with i know you've grown

245
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
with synthetic nutrients

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,400
said i can't speak i know you've grown

247
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,279
with synthetic nutrients in the past

248
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,839
do you also grow with organic nutrients

249
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,119
i do

250
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,959
actually i'm kind of uh gap bridging the

251
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,240
gap right now of the two because

252
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,318
i was originally shown and i learned

253
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,598
with synthetic nutrients i started off

254
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,280
with fox farm

255
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,319
which i think we've probably you know if

256
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,758
you've ever run synthetic nutrients

257
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,160
pretty much everybody's either heard of

258
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
it or run it and that's where i learned

259
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
and so

260
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
um yeah i just learned with bottled

261
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
synthetic newts

262
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,080
and i've kind of bridged or i've kind of

263
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
run the whole gamut i guess you could

264
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,479
you could say between fox farm and then

265
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,518
i moved to gh

266
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,000
and veg bloom and advance and i bought

267
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,879
all those bottles like that whole line i

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,559
thought i had to have

269
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,240
all of them you know to make sure that

270
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,278
my plant was getting everything that it

271
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,799
needed

272
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,838
and i i just found that you don't and so

273
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,439
i kind of wanted to

274
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,399
understand what i was actually feeding

275
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,800
my plants

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,759
what's in that bottle of fox farm you

277
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,799
know tiger bloom

278
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,879
that i'm going to be given to my plants

279
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,039
so that's when i kind of switched over

280
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
to organic and wanted to understand

281
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,360
exactly like you were saying feeding the

282
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,519
soil instead of feeding

283
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,959
the actual plant and the difference

284
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,560
there and it's

285
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,479
you know it's it's definitely a

286
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,479
completely different world

287
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,159
like you were saying deficiencies you

288
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
can't just solve overnight

289
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,759
uh that that's a little bit difficult

290
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,360
for me to understand

291
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,958
knowing that you know with the synthetic

292
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
line i can just grab that little bottle

293
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,439
of

294
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,639
you know nitrogen or whatever if it's

295
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
lacking something and

296
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,759
within a couple you know 24 hours 48

297
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,719
hours

298
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,120
we're good to go but yeah i've really

299
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
been

300
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,959
enjoying learning more about organics

301
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
and feeding the soil and what i need to

302
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,278
do to keep my plants happy

303
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,039
with that same with me i've used

304
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,879
synthetics for i think i used fox arm

305
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,439
trio for the first six years of my life

306
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,120
of six years of growing uh and then i

307
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,040
started venturing out into other

308
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,519
lines and now eventually work my way

309
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,319
into the organic side of things

310
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,360
so just like you uh but you but both of

311
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
us kind of do have

312
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,159
uh experience growing a bunch of

313
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,919
different using a bunch of different

314
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,360
bottled lines right so

315
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,120
before we get into those different

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
bottled lines that we've used and kind

317
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,759
of tips on using those different bottled

318
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,278
lines

319
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,120
let's talk about water let's talk about

320
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,399
ph ppm and ec

321
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,879
so what type of water do you typically

322
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,559
use

323
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,240
you know do you use tap water do you use

324
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,199
well water ro

325
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,120
rain water i am straight tap water it's

326
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
coming right out of the tap here in my

327
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,919
city in michigan

328
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,920
um and you know i run about the yes i do

329
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,838
check ph and ec for sure when i'm

330
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,958
running synthetics you definitely need

331
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
to know

332
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,799
what you're giving your plant and what

333
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,399
your plant is giving back out

334
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:51,439
so uh yeah i definitely check ph

335
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,039
and my water here is not too horrible it

336
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,480
runs usually around

337
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,278
uh an eight um so it's not terrible but

338
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,519
it's not

339
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,120
uh it's not great either so i definitely

340
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,120
have to make sure i adjust

341
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,879
after i add my newts and sometimes you

342
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,039
find with the

343
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,320
bottled nutrient lines they kind of

344
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,480
adjust themselves

345
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
they're somehow regulated and believe me

346
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
i'm not a scientist so i don't know how

347
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,799
it works

348
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,639
but however it works they just it's some

349
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,319
kind but sometimes after you add

350
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,480
all of what you need to add to give your

351
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,160
plant what it needs it kind of balances

352
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,680
that ph for you but

353
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,039
always check to make sure because you

354
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,919
want to make sure that your plant is

355
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,240
getting

356
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,599
the right amount of nutrients and the

357
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
only way that you can do that is by

358
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,639
having the correct ph

359
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,320
and going in and going out so um yeah i

360
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,360
definitely check all that and i just use

361
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
straight tap water

362
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,480
ph it and check the ec

363
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,919
ec usually i run uh i usually do ppms i

364
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
know that's kind of

365
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,039
most people have a preference i usually

366
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,240
do ppms

367
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,480
and i usually do about a three to six in

368
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,680
early veg three to six hundred ppm's

369
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,440
early veg

370
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,159
and a 600 to 900 mid to late veg

371
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
and then bump it up from there into

372
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,319
flower

373
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,240
and and i like to stay about a 6.2 to

374
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,399
6.5 ph

375
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,600
generally when i'm running a bottle line

376
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
got it that makes sense

377
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,278
and for watering you know you mentioned

378
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
you use tap water

379
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,519
a lot of tap water comes with either

380
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,838
chlorine or chloramine which can be

381
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,560
harmful for the microbes in the soil

382
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
do you do anything with the tap water

383
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,399
before you mix your nutrients in do you

384
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,159
like let it sit out so the chlorine

385
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,278
dissipates or do you even have chlorine

386
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,360
or chloramine in your local water or

387
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,639
ours i have checked it and it doesn't

388
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
seem to be too bad

389
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,159
the it right straight out of the tap

390
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
it's coming out at about 200

391
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,759
to 50 ppms it's not too too bad so i

392
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,959
don't worry too much about adding

393
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,720
extra to the water or letting it sit i

394
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,119
kind of let my plants

395
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,120
tell me how they feel and if my plants

396
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
look happy with the way that the

397
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
you know with the system that i'm using

398
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
now which is generally not

399
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,759
waiting or adding anything to my tap

400
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,000
water then

401
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,759
i i don't i tend to just leave it as it

402
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
is if my plants look happy then i'm

403
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,519
happy

404
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
and that's something to keep in mind

405
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,159
when you're using these bottled

406
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
nutrients is what your ppm

407
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,399
is coming out of the tap right ppm or ec

408
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
is coming out of the tap because

409
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
the nutrients you mix up is going to be

410
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
in addition

411
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
to that right so for sure if your

412
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,399
feeding chart says 500 ppm is

413
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
is this mixture um you know grow a grow

414
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
b whatever

415
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,599
that's going to be on top of what is

416
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
coming out of your tap so

417
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
actually in my local area we have

418
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
chlorine

419
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
and it actually comes out of the tap at

420
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,919
like 485 ppm

421
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,278
wow extremely high i think epa

422
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,198
guidelines is

423
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,198
no higher than 500 i think if it's over

424
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,919
500 it's unsafe

425
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,879
to drink or whatever so mine's very very

426
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,639
high and then

427
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,320
i looked at my local water report and

428
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
they do have a breakdown of what's in

429
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
there

430
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,479
and i was pretty surprised to see that

431
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,399
of the 485 ppm

432
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,480
80 ppm is sodium so actually when i used

433
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
i did a grow with tap water i've done

434
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
several grows with tap water over the

435
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,600
years but

436
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
one in particular i did a grow with tap

437
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,278
water

438
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,519
then i got a soil sample from logan labs

439
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,679
and my sodium level was through the roof

440
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,120
oh wow so for those that don't know

441
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,399
logan labs does soil

442
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
samples i think generally it's

443
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
recommended to do a soil sample between

444
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,759
grows

445
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,600
uh some of my some may advise

446
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,519
differently on that one but

447
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
there are consultants out there that you

448
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
can sit down and look over your soil

449
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
sample with

450
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
and they'll give you guidance on what

451
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
amendments you need to add or whatever

452
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
to kind of

453
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,839
rebalance that soil which which is

454
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,879
pretty cool but yeah i was really

455
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,199
surprised with

456
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,799
80 ppm of sodium and that there was such

457
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,919
a build up there

458
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,000
so that's something that that folks

459
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,519
should certainly be aware of um you know

460
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,720
when they're using tap water

461
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,320
yeah i definitely did not consider that

462
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
when i first started i wasn't even

463
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,320
thinking about until i think i saw one

464
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,359
somebody's video one of the youtube

465
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,399
videos that i might have

466
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,839
even been you actually and uh yeah and i

467
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,278
didn't even think about oh my gosh i

468
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,320
gotta add

469
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,000
the that number to the actual end

470
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,560
result to make sure i'm getting the

471
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
right amount of ppms into my plans

472
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,838
so yeah definitely got to keep an eye on

473
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,959
all that stuff for sure

474
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,240
cool so we talked about ph you

475
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,239
talked about what your ideal range is

476
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,120
talk about ppm what your ideal ranges

477
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
are

478
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,039
good um now let's talk about top feeding

479
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,799
versus bottom feeding

480
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,159
traditional way to feed your plants is

481
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,399
to mix up nutrients maybe put in a

482
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,000
pitcher or spray or something and then

483
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
feed on the top right you do a soil

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,919
drench from the top

485
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
i heard on your on that interview with

486
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,360
photosyntec that you do

487
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,958
bottom feeding there what you like to

488
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
call butt chugging right yeah

489
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,719
can you talk to us a little bit about

490
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,278
bottom feeding versus top feeding and

491
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,399
some of the benefits so on and so forth

492
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,720
yeah um

493
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,320
i i do a regular podcast the michigan

494
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,278
bros grow show and

495
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,120
we they kind of have shown me the way as

496
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,198
we call it butt chugging with bottom

497
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,278
watering i was always a top water

498
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,879
i always just filled up a bucket added

499
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,838
my nutrients and just poured it right

500
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,000
over the top

501
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,120
um just like i do with my plants outside

502
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,879
in my garden

503
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,959
and i i just never really thought about

504
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,320
bottom watering or the benefits of why

505
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,078
you would want a bottom water as opposed

506
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
to just pouring it right over the top

507
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,719
and i've found there's so many benefits

508
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,720
to quote-unquote butt chugging it i know

509
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,480
that that's a term that a lot of people

510
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,160
in the industry either love or hate you

511
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,639
either giggle or you don't

512
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,838
and we just giggle at it you know it's

513
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
just it's just something

514
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
a term that we like to use and it's just

515
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
kind of just kind of gives us a little

516
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,959
bit

517
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,120
extra giggle when we're down there

518
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,479
watering so generally i just take the

519
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
same amount of water that i would have

520
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,680
poured over the top

521
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,480
and pour it in the reservoir at the

522
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,919
bottom and that eliminates a lot of

523
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,720
problems that you can come across

524
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,000
with fungus gnats and pests with you

525
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,480
know having the top layer of that

526
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
soil being a little bit damp can cause a

527
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
little bit of a problem if you've ever

528
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
found that

529
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,639
and the butt chugging just really seems

530
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,360
to eliminate that problem altogether

531
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,078
and you know it just also it's just so

532
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,160
much

533
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,599
i a lot of people call it the lazy vans

534
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,439
way of watering too

535
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,078
i don't know if you've ever used radical

536
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,279
bags or fabric bags a lot of times if

537
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,519
you pour that

538
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,279
water right over the top it can run

539
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,480
right off the sides especially in those

540
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,879
radical bags

541
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,038
so the bottom bottom watering the butt

542
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,640
chugging sure eliminates that problem

543
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,400
all the way around so your nutrients

544
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,038
aren't going right off the side and

545
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
into on the floor or whatever in the

546
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,480
reservoir

547
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,400
so yeah that's i just have really become

548
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,880
a fan of bottom watering for

549
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
for all both of those reasons gotcha

550
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
okay so let's start talking about these

551
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
bottle lines now before we actually get

552
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
into each bottle line individually

553
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,119
there's a question i want to ask you so

554
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,639
when i first

555
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,319
started getting i think i was on fox

556
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
farm i was growing with that for six

557
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,439
years like i mentioned

558
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,879
yeah and i was just starting to venture

559
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
out into new

560
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
lines and i asked growers with more

561
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
experience so maybe you know which line

562
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
should i try should i try this one

563
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
should i try this one this one looks

564
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,558
good that one looks good

565
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,759
you know so on and so forth and the

566
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,319
general consensus

567
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,519
among a lot of these growers with

568
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,200
experience with

569
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,038
several bottled lines i was a little bit

570
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
surprised on this is that

571
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,640
they're saying a lot of these lines are

572
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,000
very very similar to the point where you

573
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
should just pick one

574
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,599
and go with it right and we're talking

575
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
base nutrients so it's mostly synthetic

576
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,038
lines they're gonna have base nutrients

577
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,119
and then they're gonna have additives on

578
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,759
top of it right so base nutrients

579
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,798
typically consists of two maybe three

580
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,038
bottles

581
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,000
like uh i know blue planet nutrients has

582
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,519
a blue max

583
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,319
part uh a part b fox farm has the fox

584
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,480
farm trio

585
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,918
three bottles of nutrients there are

586
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
several lines out there that have either

587
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,120
two bottles

588
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,440
or three bottles of their base nutrients

589
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,159
and then they have additives beyond that

590
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
that being said would you agree or

591
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,840
disagree

592
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,798
with these lines being very similar to

593
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,119
ways you just

594
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,798
kind of pick one and go with it in my

595
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,000
experience i didn't find that they were

596
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,038
similar at all

597
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,679
um i i just the the fox farm

598
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,558
may be a little similar to the gh i

599
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,798
thought

600
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,319
uh but once i switched over to veg bloom

601
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,079
and having the powder noods as opposed

602
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,279
to the bottles that was completely new

603
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,199
for me um and the

604
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,519
advanced nutrients just seemed to

605
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,240
separate every single thing

606
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,720
out into a different bottle and so i

607
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,599
mean

608
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
obviously for certain purposes but um

609
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,359
yeah

610
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,119
i found that i think that they all had

611
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,879
a different flavor i think they all had

612
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,798
a different result in my experience in

613
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,160
my environment anyway they did

614
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,679
so i that's why i chose to kind of

615
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,880
experiment throughout the different

616
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,038
lines because

617
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
i wanted to see the differences in what

618
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,480
it would bring and if this one would

619
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,599
bring a different flavor or more terps

620
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,319
than this one

621
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,279
so um yeah i i tend to think that they

622
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,759
all have their own

623
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,879
advantages and disadvantages and and

624
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,119
i've really

625
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
found my niche now with it's not really

626
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,119
it's not synthetic it's an

627
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240
organic bottled nutrient with bloom

628
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,158
yellow bottles

629
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,279
which is an australian company who i

630
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,679
found through you

631
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,440
funny enough um i obviously used to

632
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
watch your videos when i was first

633
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,159
starting out religiously

634
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,600
and one time you chose to use the bloom

635
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,200
yellow bottles i believe they sent you a

636
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,759
sample or something and

637
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,319
and your girls were loving it and i paid

638
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,640
attention and so when i was uh

639
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,399
at a local girl store i found that they

640
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
had had a little expo

641
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,159
and the guy from bloom yellow bottles

642
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,839
was there and sent me home with a sample

643
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,880
of the whole line

644
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,519
and it is organic and but it is bottles

645
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,640
and

646
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,480
um i i just my plants in my environment

647
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
just really really love it and i have

648
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,319
stuck with them ever since

649
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,759
nice nice i'm glad to hear that you've

650
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,079
gotten success off of them

651
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,279
and yeah yeah i definitely i like using

652
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,798
them i wasn't too

653
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,839
too happy about the amount of bottles

654
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,679
that they have and then they have like

655
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,359
18 different bottles told

656
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,798
when you talk about their foiler sprays

657
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,199
and stuff like that but

658
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,000
um but yeah again i think you can get

659
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,798
away with just

660
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,440
the grow a and the grill b i think they

661
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,480
have one

662
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,080
grow a grey b for veg grey b and b for

663
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,120
flower i believe right

664
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,918
yeah um do you use just those or

665
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,279
what other um bottles do you use from

666
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,000
bloom yellow bottles and do you have any

667
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,599
tips

668
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
for using bloom yellow bottles we'll

669
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:21,038
start with them yeah sure uh

670
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,038
i do use quite a few but i have found

671
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,960
that you can really narrow it down

672
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,440
to just basically like you said the

673
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
bases the a and b's and fly in veg and

674
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
flower

675
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
and i really think that the plants

676
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,918
benefit from

677
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:38,879
uh humates humates and then they have a

678
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,759
sea minerals line there's a seaweed uh

679
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
sea fuel

680
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,599
and sea minerals that i think have

681
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
really

682
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,119
made a difference in the plants and

683
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,158
their health so

684
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,879
those are the main ones aside from their

685
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
other

686
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
product which is a roots product

687
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,440
obviously

688
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,798
um you know that that helps you know

689
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
create your rise of fear and make sure

690
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,079
that everything is getting

691
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,440
getting all good and the microbes are

692
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,798
doing their job to make sure the plant

693
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,519
can uptake those nutrients that you're

694
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,679
feeding them

695
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,440
now do you follow their feeding schedule

696
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,080
that they put out on their website

697
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,960
and uh if so do you do the full dose

698
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,759
like they recommend

699
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,558
or did you do a half dose or what no i

700
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,119
don't i

701
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,879
don't think any of us synthetic growers

702
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,719
or bottlenews growers

703
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,880
ever actually do um i always probably

704
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
start with either a quarter to a half of

705
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
what they recommend on the bottle

706
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,919
just to make sure i don't want to burn

707
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,200
my plan and you can

708
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,759
always oh you can always correct

709
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
but you can take away so if you're

710
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,158
feeding

711
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,480
right out of the gate what they're

712
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,720
recommending sometimes your plants may

713
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,120
not be used to it at that point so

714
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,960
i generally try to get away with less is

715
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,479
more

716
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,319
so i i do i just generally try to

717
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,558
take a look at my plants are they happy

718
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,720
are they showing any kind of deficiency

719
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,839
if they are that's when you can correct

720
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
but generally

721
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,119
i take the less is more approach and

722
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,678
that seems to be working for me

723
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,399
got it and then when you add it to your

724
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,080
water

725
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,640
are you adjusting the p are you looking

726
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,759
at the ph then phppn are you adjusting

727
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
the ph then

728
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,200
and what do you use to adjust the ph if

729
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,519
you do you know i

730
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
don't tend to worry about it too much

731
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,839
with the organics

732
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,719
uh with the bloom yellow bottles i i

733
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,519
generally

734
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,240
kind of leave my blue lab pens to the

735
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,240
side

736
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,279
until later in flower when i want to

737
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,319
make sure

738
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,759
um everything is is okay and towards

739
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,079
you know getting towards the end i want

740
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,919
to make sure that those that plant is

741
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,759
flushing properly and make sure that all

742
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,038
that nutrients are out of there but

743
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,558
um for the most part no yeah i i kind of

744
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,839
put the ph pen away with the bloom

745
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,798
yellow bottles it's only when i'm

746
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,119
running like a

747
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:52,798
you know a veg bloom or um you know gh

748
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,399
or one of those lines that i tend to use

749
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,079
them a lot but

750
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
you know for the most part uh the bloom

751
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,119
yellow bottle seemed to kind of adjust

752
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,600
i have checked it um after adding just

753
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,359
to see

754
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,599
just to make sure that i'm not crazy out

755
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,240
of whack and it seems to kind of settle

756
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,359
around

757
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,960
an acceptable range for my plants so i

758
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,000
generally just don't try to mess with it

759
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,759
i feel like like

760
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,359
going back to what i said before less is

761
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,200
more why add that

762
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,439
acid or you know if you don't have to

763
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,278
with the ph up or ph down and just you

764
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
know those blue and orange and

765
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,880
all this you know i just would rather

766
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,640
less is more

767
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
that makes sense yeah i would assume i

768
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
mean you said you were coming in like

769
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,879
eight

770
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
something ph to begin with your tap you

771
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,400
know i assume after

772
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,200
adding those nutrients i would assume it

773
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,519
would drop

774
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,278
into that acceptable range and then once

775
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,839
you add those in your microbes

776
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,038
actually adjust the ph range in the soil

777
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,399
as well and

778
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,400
you know the whole organic side of

779
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
things as well so a lot of people say

780
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
that

781
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,719
when you're organics you don't have to

782
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,319
check ph you don't have to check ppm

783
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
et cetera et cetera so that's pretty

784
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,558
cool that that's how that works out for

785
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,400
you

786
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,639
yeah they're doing well with it and i

787
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,679
can't you know i i can't say anything

788
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
bad about that company or um you know

789
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,798
the line it's

790
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,319
it's just really really worked well in

791
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,359
my environment i mean everybody's

792
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,839
environment is different

793
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,719
so for me and you know i'm a basement

794
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,720
grower

795
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,159
here in michigan with you know cement

796
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,360
black walls and

797
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,120
and i do have a a pretty nice setup and

798
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,759
then i have separate veg and flower

799
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,558
rooms

800
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,119
i don't have to grow in a tent which um

801
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,240
can be

802
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,599
trying at the same time uh

803
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
not growing in a tent because you have a

804
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,879
bigger space to have to try to control

805
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
that environment

806
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,000
but those yellow bottles just i don't

807
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,199
know

808
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,079
with a with my i'm an led grower too so

809
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,519
under all those leds and and you know

810
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,158
the blue yellow bottles just seem to be

811
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,400
really

812
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,159
making my girls happy let's move on to

813
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
fox farm nutrients

814
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,520
can you talk a little bit about your

815
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,798
experience using fox farm any tips you

816
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,079
have for that

817
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,879
ah that was the very first line i

818
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,678
ever used coming out the gate my mentor

819
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,440
was the one that used fox farm and so

820
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
uh he showed me the way with that

821
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,240
three-part system

822
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,840
and i was always

823
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,159
i don't know what it is and maybe it's

824
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,720
just kind of a mental thing for me but

825
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,278
i i don't like to eat any foods with

826
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,839
like food color like massive food like

827
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,319
blue

828
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,678
and green and red food coloring and like

829
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,798
i noticed with fox farm

830
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,679
i had kind of these weird colors and

831
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,359
and i just i don't know i i just not

832
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
that there's anything wrong with it but

833
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,558
i just would kind of put that in there

834
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,278
and in the water and i'm kind of

835
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,918
thinking

836
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,720
this is kind of like miracle grow and i

837
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,600
don't know

838
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,159
it just it just really seemed unnatural

839
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,599
to me

840
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,640
i guess so i i quickly moved away from

841
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,038
fox farm um and

842
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,960
all those other lines i really wanted to

843
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,599
try to kind of get away from

844
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,038
from everything um that just didn't seem

845
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,759
natural to me i guess

846
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,599
and maybe that makes me not a synthetic

847
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,278
grower now but

848
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,879
now that i've found bloom yellow bottles

849
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,759
but um

850
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
yeah i really the only experience i had

851
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,759
with fox farm was the

852
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,960
initial first few runs and it works it

853
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,079
works great

854
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,679
um but i found once i switched to

855
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,918
the other lines and especially with the

856
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
bloom yellow bottles the flavor and the

857
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,240
terpene

858
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,038
profile just seemed to to explode so

859
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,038
um nothing against fox farmer anybody

860
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,240
who uses it but that was my experience

861
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:29,519
and i just kind of was like

862
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,759
let's try something different

863
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,359
interesting yeah i started with fox farm

864
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,278
like i mentioned earlier i grew with

865
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,719
first six years i grew with fox farms

866
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,599
started with the trio

867
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,399
um overfed my plants at first that's a

868
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,719
very very

869
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,719
concentrated line yeah and you look at

870
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,759
their feeding chart and their ppms are

871
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,480
way out of whack and

872
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,960
just so people are aware maybe you know

873
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
there's

874
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,360
a lot of new growers watching this right

875
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:52,558
when you're looking at these feeding

876
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,398
charts

877
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,558
understand that the ppms they mention

878
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,599
are for a wide variety of plants

879
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,359
i think a lot of people jump to the

880
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,719
assumption that this is for the

881
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,398
medicinal plant

882
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,839
um you know medicinal plants can take

883
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,759
less than what's recommended on the

884
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,519
feeding charts that's why you often hear

885
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,879
about people doing a half dose people

886
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,278
doing a quarter dose

887
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,240
now for me with fox farm i would

888
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,880
actually do a

889
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,159
third dose so do a third sometimes even

890
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,960
a quarter dose

891
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,880
of fox farm nutrients their fox farm

892
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,759
trio so the three bottles that consist

893
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,840
of

894
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,759
and when i was running hps that's all i

895
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,119
needed was those three bottles

896
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,759
i would you know ph adjust using ph up

897
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,038
or ph

898
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:36,640
down and then of course monitor the

899
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,000
the r uh the ph and ppm of the runoff as

900
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
well and then kind of make adjustments

901
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,599
there

902
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,440
um but uh but i had good success with

903
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,119
fox farm nutrients but actually one

904
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
thing i found is that once i switched to

905
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,158
led

906
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,079
i started getting calcium deficiency

907
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,159
okay and i was advised to add in

908
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,759
an additive calmag which a lot of people

909
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,399
are familiar with and that solved the

910
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,679
problem

911
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,918
you know we'll talk a little bit about

912
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
additives as we're going through these

913
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,399
lines or maybe after we go through these

914
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
lines but calmagg was an additive that

915
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,759
i added with it particularly

916
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,760
particularly when using leds

917
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,640
and then one other thing was i found

918
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,599
with some particular cultivars or phenos

919
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,559
was

920
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,519
i would see phosphorus deficiency in mid

921
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,000
flowering

922
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,759
and i used beastie blooms which is a pk

923
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
booster by fox farm

924
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,038
and that solved my problems i would add

925
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,759
it week four five

926
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,798
and six only and that would completely

927
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,960
solve my

928
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,558
phosphorus issue have you used any other

929
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,919
additives at all or no

930
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,319
oh sure yeah i use um occasionally i

931
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,038
will

932
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,639
add i do still have a couple of those

933
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,200
other lines that i use so

934
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
in flour i don't really add too many

935
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
additives

936
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:49,278
in veg but in flour i definitely add

937
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,960
uh occasionally some shine by veg bloom

938
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:55,519
um i think that really adds uh density

939
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,399
and some weight uh to the product to the

940
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,558
end result

941
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:04,158
and i also like to use new millennium's

942
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,359
um product also and i'm drawing a blank

943
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,399
on what the name of it is

944
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,278
the um the frost booster you know what

945
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,000
i'm talking about

946
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,000
uh winterfell

947
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,479
winterfrost yeah uh i i like to add that

948
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,039
in flower too i think it adds a little

949
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,079
bit of

950
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,879
a little bit of frost to the girls so

951
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,839
um but and obviously bloom yellow

952
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,559
bottles does have

953
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,759
a calcium additive that i do think is

954
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,398
essential

955
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,319
especially with growing with leds so um

956
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,959
definitely have to add calmag

957
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,960
and i do add a couple of the little

958
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
bloom boosters there for

959
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,440
for density and shine and that was when

960
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,359
you were using fox farm

961
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,558
oh he's only just in general no but i i

962
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,038
still use them to this day

963
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,558
even with my glue i'll i'll add i think

964
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,960
it adds a little bit of extra

965
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,839
um i've kind of developed that system on

966
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
my own

967
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,278
as opposed to when i was running that

968
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,798
fox farm system with my mentor

969
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,398
um he would add budswell i can't even

970
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,839
remember the name of the company i don't

971
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,918
know i don't think it's a fox farm

972
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,959
company he would always add budswell

973
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,799
and a couple other things for late end

974
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,360
stage flower

975
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,158
boost but uh as far as any other

976
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,839
additives

977
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,440
too much with the fox farmland that was

978
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,319
about it let's move on to general

979
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,919
hydroponics

980
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,678
so that's actually a line that i've

981
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,480
never used i've seen a lot of people use

982
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
it with success

983
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,519
general hydro can you talk a little bit

984
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,799
about your experience using that

985
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,480
um i know their feeding chart in

986
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,918
particular you definitely have to do a

987
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,960
half dose with that one

988
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,840
as well is that correct yeah yeah i we

989
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,480
pretty much

990
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,839
when i my mentor and i he basically told

991
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,919
me right out of the gate

992
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,759
don't ever go by what the bottle says

993
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,799
just do half

994
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,519
so pretty much every line that i have

995
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,359
run i've basically started off with a

996
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,880
quarter to a half i even would do

997
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,558
a quarter sometimes because i'd be too

998
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,679
afraid to burn them

999
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,519
uh yeah so i would j with gh same thing

1000
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,200
i always fed them a half and that seemed

1001
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,798
to be doing pretty well i never had a

1002
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,759
problem with deficiencies too much with

1003
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,119
gh

1004
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,000
or anything but i just didn't think that

1005
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,319
that terp profile was there

1006
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,679
um it just i don't know just seemed to

1007
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,200
be lacking a little something for me and

1008
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,919
maybe it was my environment or maybe it

1009
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
was me

1010
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
i don't know you know i was running it

1011
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,278
when i was early growing and

1012
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,480
and uh maybe it was something i was

1013
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,599
doing wrong but

1014
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,880
as far as the gh line definitely half

1015
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,839
strength for sure because they are

1016
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,200
pretty concentrated

1017
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:30,240
like fox farm with gh did you

1018
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,080
run any additives on they have was it

1019
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,000
is it three bottles with gh the base

1020
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,519
nutrients oh

1021
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,278
my god this was so many years ago it was

1022
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,519
i think so i've run so many you know

1023
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,359
advanced had like 20 some bottles

1024
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,720
it seems like so it's hard for me to

1025
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,119
remember but

1026
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,079
yeah i think they were a three-parter

1027
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,798
and then

1028
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,359
we used the same additives with the fox

1029
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,158
farm

1030
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,519
i i just took his additives that he used

1031
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,120
with the fox farm and tried them with

1032
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,919
the gh so i would add that

1033
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,639
bud swell and there was another one that

1034
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,399
we used to use that i think got banned

1035
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,159
actually and i can't remember what the

1036
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,359
name of that one was now but

1037
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,799
you definitely have to know what you're

1038
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,158
feeding your plants at least i want to

1039
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,918
know what i'm feeding them and

1040
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,480
you know if that stuff's getting banned

1041
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,880
why why is it getting banned

1042
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,278
so yeah it might have been a pgr plant

1043
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,000
regulator which yeah which is

1044
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,319
highly controversial and yes my mentor

1045
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
was

1046
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:29,839
all about yield and

1047
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,200
i am not i am about quality so yeah it

1048
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,839
was probably was

1049
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,880
gotcha now getting into advanced

1050
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,480
nutrients

1051
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,278
this is a line that you had mentioned

1052
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
has a ton of different bottles there

1053
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,558
i've never used advanced i've heard

1054
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
nightmare stories people have a lot of

1055
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:44,879
success with the

1056
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,199
the nightmare stories that i hear is

1057
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
just that

1058
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,798
i heard that they're overpriced i heard

1059
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,159
that you know the sales people try to

1060
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,000
sell you all their bottles and you don't

1061
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,679
actually need all their bottles and

1062
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,038
and so on and so forth so can you tell

1063
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
me a little bit about like advanced

1064
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,359
nutrients

1065
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,678
you know the base nutrients that they

1066
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,158
have maybe the additives you used with

1067
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,559
them

1068
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,360
and so on and so forth sure yeah i

1069
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,119
actually

1070
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,878
loved advance when i first started

1071
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,199
running them as opposed to the fox farm

1072
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,719
and

1073
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:16,319
and the gh because they had that ph

1074
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:18,319
perfect system so it was easy you know

1075
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,879
you added that three part i think it was

1076
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,000
uh

1077
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:25,199
i used the micro grow and bloom

1078
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,480
line um from them and so yeah mike

1079
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:31,199
added that every time and uh

1080
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,800
my my plants loved it i can't i don't

1081
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,598
have anything bad to say

1082
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,159
about that about them in any way other

1083
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,559
than

1084
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,398
they did seem to separate every single

1085
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,639
bottle or every single

1086
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,480
possible nutrient out into a separate

1087
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,240
bottle and then it just seemed like they

1088
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,800
had so many different

1089
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,598
lines of the same nutrient like they had

1090
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,560
three different

1091
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,320
roots products and i was always kind of

1092
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,838
like

1093
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,039
i don't get it but okay you know

1094
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,719
and in the end i

1095
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,079
kind of thought that everything tasted

1096
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,480
the same i

1097
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,200
i would run several different strains

1098
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,159
together

1099
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,759
in the same room and at the end it

1100
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,639
seemed to me that everything tasted the

1101
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,320
same

1102
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,639
and smelled the same and had the same

1103
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,880
terp profile so again

1104
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,759
maybe this is going back to i know the

1105
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,519
gh

1106
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,599
or whatever maybe i did something wrong

1107
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,358
but it just um

1108
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,440
just didn't seem to do it for me so

1109
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,480
that's when i i wanted

1110
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,559
something else i i knew that there was

1111
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,679
medicinal plants that tasted different

1112
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,799
from each other

1113
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,118
so obviously i wanted to find out how i

1114
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,359
could

1115
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,400
make that happen and that's when i ended

1116
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,519
up switching from

1117
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,760
advanced over to bloom i found them

1118
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,639
and wow what a difference there's a huge

1119
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,680
difference

1120
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,319
but advanced it it's good company a lot

1121
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,078
of bottles

1122
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,920
very expensive but they grow good plants

1123
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
i i don't have anything bad to say about

1124
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,039
them there my plants were happy

1125
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,679
let's talk a little bit more about their

1126
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,480
ph perfect that you mentioned

1127
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,598
i'm a little bit familiar with that you

1128
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,639
might be able to correct me from wrong

1129
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,440
here but

1130
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,078
uh from my understanding it's basically

1131
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,880
once you

1132
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,519
add in those nutrients into water it's

1133
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
going to be in the ideal range

1134
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,759
of ph for plants so that you don't have

1135
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
to use

1136
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
ph up and ph down and go go back and

1137
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,358
forth potentially

1138
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,199
trying to get it into that particular

1139
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,838
range yeah is that correct

1140
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,639
yeah yeah and it was great and i even

1141
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:32,880
did check it

1142
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,879
um i used to use the old school you know

1143
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
the little plastic bottles and the

1144
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,920
you know check the color with the drops

1145
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,280
and everything

1146
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,320
before i got a blue lab pen um

1147
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,560
makes things so much easier but uh

1148
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,640
yeah i would check it just to make sure

1149
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,199
it just like this can't possibly like i

1150
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,400
just added all of this stuff it can't

1151
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,039
possibly but

1152
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,519
every time it was perfect and i don't

1153
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,759
know

1154
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,800
the technology just them the way that

1155
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200
they have

1156
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,720
you running their system obviously the

1157
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,159
scientists put that together so that

1158
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,439
they know that this one is going to

1159
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,199
adjust it to this point

1160
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,559
so that you know you're feeding the

1161
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,078
plants in that correct range that they

1162
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,199
can uptake the nutrients in the way that

1163
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,839
they need

1164
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,239
so yeah it was great for that and it was

1165
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,400
it's

1166
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,838
great for beginners in that way because

1167
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,480
then you don't have that

1168
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,279
extra step of oh no you know i added my

1169
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
nutrients

1170
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,040
is it in the right range for my plants

1171
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,358
to be able to uptake those correctly

1172
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,039
so it's perfect for beginners in that

1173
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,559
way in that aspect because

1174
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,400
you don't have to mess around with it at

1175
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,519
all and the plants are happy

1176
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,160
definitely sounds like that would be a

1177
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,519
benefit make things easier sure um i

1178
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,838
wonder how

1179
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,838
it would impact like a half dose of

1180
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,759
nutrients versus a quarter dose versus

1181
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,279
if it's still going to adjust the ph

1182
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
accurately like that and also different

1183
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,960
water sources right

1184
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,119
you know using tap water what you said

1185
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,079
has like 200 ppm how does that impact

1186
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,200
versus ro water with you know close to

1187
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,519
zero ppm

1188
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,358
or distilled water you know right so on

1189
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,960
and so forth um

1190
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,519
and that is definitely one of the lines

1191
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,358
that i follow the instructions on to

1192
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,039
because i was concerned about that ph

1193
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,078
perfect system so i'm like well i must

1194
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,119
have to use

1195
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,079
exactly what they indicate on on the

1196
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,280
directions

1197
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,280
to obtain that ph perfect technology and

1198
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,839
i so i never did really experiment

1199
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
outside of that and i should have maybe

1200
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,159
that's

1201
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,000
maybe that was the problem with you know

1202
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,000
the everything tasting the same

1203
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,039
like i said i'm not blaming any of the

1204
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,199
companies for

1205
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,880
you know any of the situation that i

1206
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,078
ended up with the result that i ended up

1207
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
with in the end

1208
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,760
other than that was what i experienced

1209
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,800
and maybe it was something i did maybe

1210
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,160
it wasn't but

1211
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,240
i have had other people say to me um

1212
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,920
the same about advance that they kind of

1213
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,319
found in the end that everything kind of

1214
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,960
tasted and smelled the same so

1215
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,359
um i don't know my plants were happy it

1216
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,079
just

1217
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,639
you know it's all about that end product

1218
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,760
what is

1219
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,039
the uh what is this veg bloom

1220
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,440
nutrient you're talking about is that a

1221
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,559
company you said you also wanted

1222
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,920
yeah veg bloom uh i think it's like veg

1223
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,119
plus bloom a hydroponic research i think

1224
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,639
is the

1225
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,559
umbrella of veg bloom um

1226
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,078
yeah and they have like a veg bloom

1227
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,480
dirty they it goes they

1228
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,760
have their lines specifically for your

1229
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,000
water type

1230
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,839
so if you have like tap water you want

1231
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,519
to use the dirty if you are using

1232
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,199
ro water you want to use a different

1233
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,759
line so it's kind of like

1234
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,919
you know same thing with um bloom yellow

1235
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,760
bottles has like a european a and b

1236
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,039
and like it's so everything is kind of

1237
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,280
different with their bases

1238
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,800
yeah but for the most part they and

1239
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,000
they're powder newts too so that was a

1240
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,359
little different for me i was always

1241
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,039
used to

1242
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,799
bottles so um what switching over to

1243
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,159
that powder was definitely

1244
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,240
a different for me but um the plants

1245
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,279
were happy the only thing i i kind of

1246
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,639
didn't like about the powder was um some

1247
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,359
of it's left in the bottom of the bucket

1248
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,239
if you don't

1249
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,679
you know continuously mix it or you know

1250
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,439
make sure you let it sit for a while and

1251
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,598
dissolve real well then

1252
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,358
you have a little bit of residue at the

1253
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,880
bottom of your your bucket but

1254
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:11,039
uh great line i liked it i just didn't

1255
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,880
think anything spectacular

1256
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,400
came out at the end other than what i

1257
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,720
had been seeing so

1258
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,599
i just basically have been just trying

1259
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,838
to run

1260
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,119
everything to see what i like best and

1261
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,880
um that's where i've

1262
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,960
you know just settled on the bloom the

1263
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
yellow bottles have been doing it for me

1264
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
so until i find something else that that

1265
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,358
uh will beat them

1266
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,519
that's that's it for now but yeah the

1267
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,000
veg bloom i i do still use

1268
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,280
um the shine product that i was talking

1269
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,559
about a little while ago

1270
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
i think it just adds a little bit of

1271
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,679
density uh and that's

1272
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:46,799
in weeks i generally use it weeks

1273
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,440
two on until about week five or six

1274
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,039
in flower and then i just continue that

1275
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,159
and that's when i start the winter frost

1276
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,920
from new milan new millennium that's so

1277
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,759
hard to say can anybody say that word

1278
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,920
right

1279
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,079
milady aluminum millennium but um

1280
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
new millennium's winter frost and that's

1281
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,800
when i add that

1282
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,039
and on top of the blue yellow bottles i

1283
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,079
just think it adds a little extra

1284
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:15,440
so but yeah the veg bloom great company

1285
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,720
great line it just uh moved on

1286
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,480
i have to check them out i'm not

1287
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,838
familiar with them okay

1288
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,000
one line that i have tried which i

1289
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,119
believe you haven't tried is blue planet

1290
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
nutrients right

1291
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,720
you haven't tried them um blue planet

1292
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,160
there was a seaweed i think i bought

1293
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,039
like a kelp seaweed

1294
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,318
um bottle from them once off of the

1295
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,318
amazon because i think

1296
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,759
i heard you talking about blue planet so

1297
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:43,199
i'm going to try them

1298
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,079
and i i loved it but i never used like

1299
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,439
their whole line so i thought about it

1300
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,440
for a minute and then i found blue

1301
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
yellow bottles and so i tried them

1302
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,559
instead of ordering because the guy just

1303
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,639
loaded me up with

1304
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,000
you know all the free samples and then

1305
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,679
ever since then i'm like oh

1306
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,960
so old on the bloom yellow bottles so i

1307
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,639
never went back and actually did the

1308
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,559
full line of blue planet but

1309
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,960
just that one product but and i did like

1310
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,400
it it did you know work really well

1311
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,920
yeah i've used blue planted nutrients

1312
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,280
for for several years you're talking

1313
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,480
about liquid seaweed by the way i

1314
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,599
believe that's the name of the bottle is

1315
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
liquid seaweed yeah

1316
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,680
that's what it was yeah i loved it so i

1317
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,119
actually used blue planted nutrients

1318
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,799
i can speak about them for a little bit

1319
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,200
just my experience using them

1320
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,200
i use them for several years had great

1321
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,039
results with it i started with their

1322
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,799
three-part base nutrients that they have

1323
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,000
i think it's their high-yield system

1324
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,519
it's a three-part

1325
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,800
plus a whole bunch of different

1326
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,920
additives i think there was eight

1327
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
bottles total

1328
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,599
that i would use so kind of a lot of

1329
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,800
bottles there but um they worked they

1330
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,519
worked pretty good

1331
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,720
um i would start with a half dose and it

1332
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,519
you know according to their feeding

1333
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,719
chart and

1334
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,639
everything went good and i would just

1335
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,439
adjust based on what that runoff

1336
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,920
ppm was and one thing i did like about

1337
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,960
them

1338
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,119
is that it almost kind of had that ph

1339
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,920
perfect in this in a sense that advanced

1340
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,838
has

1341
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,400
every time i mix up a half dose of

1342
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,480
nutrients i would get 5.8 ph

1343
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,000
no matter what you know no matter which

1344
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,199
additives i used or whatever

1345
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,960
so that was kind of convenient because i

1346
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,679
knew exactly how much ph up i should be

1347
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,679
adding in

1348
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,879
it just made things a lot easier kind of

1349
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,519
and then if i'm in cocoa

1350
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,680
i usually like to do 5.8 in cocoa every

1351
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,519
time just feed it in every single time

1352
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,118
and so mix up my nutrients didn't have

1353
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,039
to do any sort of ph

1354
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,559
when i'm growing in cocoa so that's

1355
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:21,039
something i did liked it but yeah i use

1356
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,279
their

1357
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,639
high yield system for for several years

1358
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,680
i use their

1359
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:30,159
bluemax it's a two part that they have

1360
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,879
i used that along with some additives as

1361
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,000
well

1362
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
and uh yeah no complaints uh on that

1363
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,880
avenue

1364
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,240
so yeah yeah i definitely was going that

1365
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,838
route because i saw the

1366
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,838
you know your plants were liking it too

1367
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,239
so i definitely was looking into them

1368
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,480
and did that did buy that liquid seaweed

1369
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,239
and liked it but for the most part uh i

1370
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800
i discovered the bloom yellow bottles by

1371
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,879
chance

1372
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,920
at a local growth stores expo and uh

1373
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,480
got sidetracked with them now do you add

1374
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,559
any

1375
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,838
sugars into your garden at all whether

1376
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,199
it be molasses

1377
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:05,000
or honey or anything like that i don't

1378
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,239
only because i use a product called

1379
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,280
recharge

1380
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,039
and i'm sure most yeah i'm sure you

1381
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,519
and most everybody that's watching has

1382
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,800
heard a recharge before but it's a micro

1383
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:19,599
microbial product uh and

1384
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,079
it has molasses in it so i don't tend to

1385
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,280
add any extra because i use that as my

1386
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,480
once a week treat as scottie riel says

1387
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,000
and uh the girls are happy so i don't

1388
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,159
tend to add anything extra

1389
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,838
but i would if i didn't use recharge i

1390
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,118
probably would add some sort of

1391
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,119
sweetener because you have to feed those

1392
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,358
microbes in order for them to keep

1393
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,599
staying alive to do their work because i

1394
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,519
do use i'm a soil grower

1395
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
um you were mentioning you like to do

1396
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,400
the 5.8 in cocoa and

1397
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,199
and i'm a soil grower i run either coast

1398
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
of maine or

1399
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:55,039
route 707 i generally like um

1400
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,000
and for the first like two to three four

1401
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,079
weeks of veg

1402
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,920
and then i'll switch over to my blue

1403
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,519
yellow bottles after that and feed

1404
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,960
after that once they start running out

1405
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,000
of food but you gotta feed those

1406
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,199
microbes in order

1407
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,639
to get you know them to be able to keep

1408
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,559
doing their work to be able to get the

1409
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,118
plants to uptake those newts

1410
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,880
so yeah i would definitely use a sugar

1411
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,800
if i was not using recharge but

1412
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,079
i don't think it's really necessary they

1413
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,160
seem to be doing their job

1414
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,160
with the recharge yeah recharge is

1415
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,279
awesome that microbial inoculant which

1416
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,920
is another thing i was going to ask you

1417
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,519
about is

1418
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,960
do you use any microbial inoculants i

1419
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,519
use recharge as well

1420
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,720
so it has the molasses in there like you

1421
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,960
mentioned also has kelp

1422
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,559
in there it has a ton of different

1423
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,760
beneficial microbes in there

1424
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,199
as well so i love that stuff do you use

1425
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,680
that throughout the entire grill

1426
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,118
or did you just use it okay yeah some

1427
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,199
people only use it in veg i know some

1428
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,880
people only use it in flour

1429
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,639
but it is safe to use throughout the

1430
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,318
entire grow so i was curious if you used

1431
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,039
it throughout the entire growing up

1432
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,519
i do i use a couple products upon

1433
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,719
transplant every time when i pot up

1434
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,318
called azoles and mycos so i use it

1435
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,000
every time i transplant up and then i

1436
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,279
water and recharge

1437
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,838
every time and i use the recharge once a

1438
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
week

1439
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,358
until about five weeks or week five

1440
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,400
of flour and then i'll discontinue the

1441
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,759
use because i don't think it

1442
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,800
you know you know really needed too much

1443
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,200
at that point and it finishes off nicely

1444
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,440
so yeah i use it through the whole

1445
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,358
process and there's also another product

1446
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,599
from veg bloom that i

1447
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,358
add in every now and then because i mean

1448
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,519
what i have the bottle down there

1449
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,880
and or container i should say it's not a

1450
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,119
bottle but um

1451
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,160
of plus life and it's also another

1452
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,519
microbial

1453
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,920
product that is you know from veg bloom

1454
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,358
so i'll add that occasionally every

1455
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,639
couple weeks just to give it a little

1456
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,559
bit of different

1457
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,318
microbes in there that wasn't that's not

1458
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,318
in the recharge and

1459
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,838
it seems to be working got it and the

1460
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:50,960
azos and micos

1461
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,039
uh i've heard of that problem because i

1462
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,639
haven't had a chance to use them

1463
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,239
i have a lot of good success that's a

1464
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,559
mycorrhizal fungi

1465
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,159
type products for for both of them and i

1466
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,759
assume there's some other beneficials in

1467
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,078
there as well is that is that right

1468
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,079
yeah i mean i'm not going to be able to

1469
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,800
explain exactly what's in those things

1470
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,760
but

1471
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,000
i used to follow along with you when i

1472
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,000
was

1473
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,318
first starting growing i used to follow

1474
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,599
a guy on youtube called the grateful

1475
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,159
grower

1476
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,000
and when i was first learning he was

1477
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,199
showing how to transplant this is how

1478
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,719
you do this and this is how you do it

1479
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,318
and he always used

1480
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,919
a little bit of azos a little bit of

1481
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,000
mycos and

1482
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,599
um then explained why and then it's

1483
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,400
beneficial bacteria and you've got to

1484
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,720
get those roots inoculated and blah blah

1485
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,760
and so yeah there i am not going to be

1486
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,759
able to spit out

1487
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,680
the scientific name of both of those

1488
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,000
products or what's in them

1489
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,318
but i do know that they make a huge

1490
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,679
difference and i get really really

1491
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,358
uh wonderful root growth once i do

1492
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,960
uh transplant with those two products

1493
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:54,318
and then water in the recharge on top

1494
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,559
it just seems to explode the root growth

1495
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:56,558
and

1496
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,800
and the beneficial bacteria just makes

1497
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,119
everything cohesive

1498
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,559
and uh yeah exactly what they need to

1499
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,318
get going

1500
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,400
yeah mycorrhizal fungi is extremely

1501
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,558
beneficial i mean it actually attaches

1502
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
to the roots and helps with the uptake

1503
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,599
of nutrients

1504
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,200
some people actually use it as a when

1505
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,079
they transplant they'll sprinkle it onto

1506
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:15,439
the roots

1507
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,280
other people use it as like a soil

1508
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,760
drench so they'll mix it in with water

1509
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
and then water their plant to use it do

1510
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,040
you sprinkle onto the roots at all or do

1511
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,119
you use it a soil drench or what

1512
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,039
what i do is uh so when i'm

1513
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,358
transplanting i basically just do my

1514
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,719
bottom layer of soil and then where i'm

1515
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,598
going to transplant in

1516
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,639
i just sprinkle the azos and the mycos

1517
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,400
right on top of there

1518
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,400
you don't have to even use very much

1519
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,280
it's just very little i've had the same

1520
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,838
bag for

1521
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,559
geez i want to say probably a year

1522
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,400
they're just little small bags and

1523
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,160
yeah you just sprinkle a tiny bit of

1524
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,720
both of those products right in there

1525
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,199
and then the roots that have already

1526
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,480
grown

1527
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,639
and been substantial they just kind of

1528
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,559
make that contact like you say and once

1529
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:02,078
that contact is made it just kind of

1530
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,640
explodes so uh and then i water

1531
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,280
in the recharge once i've transplanted

1532
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,279
that's

1533
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,200
what goes in on top of it so i think

1534
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,599
it's just kind of like a double duty

1535
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,239
hitting them from all sides similar

1536
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,240
product to

1537
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,519
azos and micos is great white

1538
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,279
mycorrhizae

1539
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,199
i use that as well and i sprinkle it

1540
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,240
onto the roots sometimes i use it as a

1541
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,719
soil trench

1542
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,679
i know some people use it in their um

1543
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,679
compost teas

1544
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,358
they'll add that in there okay yeah but

1545
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,719
then there's some controversy behind it

1546
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,400
as if

1547
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,919
microbes kind of compete with each other

1548
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,119
and then you're kind of wasting money

1549
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,318
because those microbes are getting eaten

1550
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,400
and so and so forth but

1551
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,679
we won't get into all that but yeah i've

1552
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,240
also used uh

1553
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:40,719
mammoth p which is a microbial inoculant

1554
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,838
that

1555
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,519
uh has microbes in there to focus on

1556
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:46,880
phosphorus breakdown helps with with

1557
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,440
phosphorus breakdown

1558
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,358
and um yeah so there's so many different

1559
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,920
microbial products out there and then

1560
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,880
as far as sugars we touched on i use

1561
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,559
molasses

1562
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,079
i actually created a whole video on

1563
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,160
molasses i typically

1564
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,920
use it as a soul drench i'll actually

1565
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,118
i'll leave a link to that video down

1566
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,358
in the description section below if

1567
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,760
anybody wants to learn more about

1568
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,598
molasses and how to incorporate it into

1569
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,760
your garden

1570
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,440
so more and more places are becoming

1571
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,319
legal more and more growers are coming

1572
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,800
onto the market

1573
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,639
it seems like the comment sections are

1574
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,760
flooded with beginners looking for

1575
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,838
advice

1576
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,960
what tips or advice do you have for

1577
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,679
those who are

1578
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,358
new or are struggling to get feeding

1579
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,078
dialed in

1580
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,639
my advice is basically from my

1581
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,839
experience

1582
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,719
just look at your plants look at what

1583
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,759
they're doing

1584
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,679
do they look happy are they droopy do

1585
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,000
they show signs of deficiencies

1586
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,440
you know are they nice and green or are

1587
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,079
do they have spots on them are they

1588
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,280
yellowing you know just basically

1589
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,119
my advice is just do your research on

1590
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,720
what your plants look like

1591
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,720
if you're spotting something that

1592
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,118
doesn't look normal

1593
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,199
research it there's so many great

1594
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,680
resources now that we have available to

1595
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,719
us

1596
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,838
between forums and youtube podcasters

1597
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,598
and everything that can

1598
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:06,880
basically spell it out what's going on

1599
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,680
with your plans and

1600
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,800
basically that's the biggest advice i

1601
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,039
can give you is just

1602
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,119
take a look at your plants what are they

1603
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,759
doing what do they look like

1604
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,160
don't just automatically feed that four

1605
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,000
tablespoons or teaspoons of

1606
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,920
you know fox farm to that gallon of

1607
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,838
water um

1608
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,200
or whatever that direction says just

1609
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,639
because it says it

1610
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,199
you know just pay attention to your

1611
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,239
plants and i think that that will reward

1612
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,000
you in the end

1613
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,639
so where can the listeners find you and

1614

that i am working on right now uh here

1628
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,200
in michigan i have a

1629
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,000
few partners and we're looking at

1630
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:15,598
opening

1631
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,039
um a class c facility here in michigan

1632
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,920
hopefully in the next year or two um

1633
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,599
fingers crossed granted you know timing

1634
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,039
is right and investors are

1635
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,240
are willing so that's our next step um

1636
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:32,719
is going into branding and and trying to

1637
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,318
get those investors to give us the money

1638
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,679
to start growing medicine

1639
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,759
um for everyone so i already do that as

1640
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,279
a caregiver here in michigan and i found

1641
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,800
i love it so much that i just

1642
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,119
i just want to do it on a larger scale

1643
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,680
and do it professionally so

1644
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,480
that's what's on the horizon for me and

1645
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,440
