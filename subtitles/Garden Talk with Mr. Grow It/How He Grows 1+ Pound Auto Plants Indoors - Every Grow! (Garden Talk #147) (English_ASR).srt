some massive Auto flowers and uh I

77
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,959
actually had at least one person I think

78
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,158
it was more than one person reach out to

79
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,598
me like you got to get him on the

80
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,120
podcast we've got to find out what he's

81
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,839
doing to these Auto flowers because they

82
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,599
are just massive and uh I can't wait to

83
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,319
pick your brain a little bit and find

84
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,759
out how you do things but first can you

85
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,518
tell us a little bit about yourself and

86
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,798
how you got into gardening yeah

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,280
absolutely my name is Lyn um you know I

88
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,680
started growing plants six years ago so

89
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,158
since uh Canada legalized it was always

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,680
a dream of mine uh to be able to uh grow

91
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,439
my own plants so um six years of

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
experience you know and I I've tried a

93
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,719
bunch of stuff but what I'm doing right

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,479
now seems to work really well um what

95
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,158
else can I say yeah so ly I'm based in

96
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:37,359
uh Yellow Knife which is in Northern

97
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,359
Canada and um you know I like to I like

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,879
to show some tidbits photos and videos

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,080
from from life up here because it's a

100
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,479
really small population very big

101
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,560
territory so it's kind of nice to be

102
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,518
able to have a platform to also show

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,199
some stuff that we do up North that's so

104
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,319
cool yeah when we linked up before

105
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,679
actually recording we kind of want to

106
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,199
meet first do a little face meet he

107
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,079
talked about the Northwest Territory and

108
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,798
it instantly reminded me of the show

109
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,879
alone and I was actually wearing the

110
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,000
shirt at the time and you said you were

111
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,280
familiar with it is they go up there and

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,840
there's a whole bunch of people they

113
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,000
drop off like 10 people in the middle of

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,039
nowhere and they got to survive it out

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,719
and uh watching that show they're

116
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,438
catching these massive fish and I look

117
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,639
at your Instagram you've got these

118
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,079
massive fish that you catch so it is

119
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,358
exciting I would love to do that

120
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,918
sometime yeah the alone show I think I

121
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,959
want to say there's two or maybe three

122
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:28,399
seasons that were filmed up here and

123
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,519
actually um on the same Lake that we

124
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,638
live on it's just on a different arm on

125
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,478
the East arm of it and I've flown on top

126
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,560
of the location of where it was filmed

127
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,959
because as part of my work I you know

128
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,160
sometimes take a lot of helicopters and

129
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,758
planes and stuff like that and working

130
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,080
with these helicopter Pilots they're

131
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,680
like yeah like we were working on the

132
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,399
show and this is where one guy was

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
dropped off and this other guy was over

134
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,038
here so it is literally the same Blake

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,038
and as you know there's giant fish out

136
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,038
there it's insane that's incredible yeah

137
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,319

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,800
posting um some of the plants some of

167
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,879
the some of the plants that I was

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,000
growing on Reddit and then people are

169
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,159
like man these plants are huge so I'm

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,598
like yeah I think you're right just

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,439
looking around on the subreddit like a

172
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,399
the flowers and be like yeah like my

173
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,719
plants are are significant like what's

174
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:24,439
going on so then I decided to uh post my

175
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,280
girls on Instagram and uh I can't do

176
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,120
what I do without this watering system

177
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,559
called autopot so in my mind

178
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,519
you know I had to come with a really

179
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,120
good handle um it took me about I want

180
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,918
to say like five days I was browsing

181
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,759
different names and stuff like that and

182
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,560
then I'm like autopot autopot what ends

183
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,560
with autopot that people can like

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
remember right so I'm like aut autopot

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,560
amus that's a good one because uh the

186
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
hippo hippopotamus is is an aquatic

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,360
animal it lives in the water and the

188
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,239
autopod is a bottom wicking system which

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,879
is basically Hydroponics you know so I'm

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,759
like man those two together would be

191
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,680
awesome and then there's the word Auto

192
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
for like automatic autoflowering and

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,439
there's the word p so it all it all

194
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,079
worked out together and then I came up

195
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,120
with the Zan helped me design the logo

196
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,000
so it all worked out yeah that's clever

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,598
clever and easy to remember I really

198
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,199
like that name that's what I was going

199
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,079
for but it took about five days of

200
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,680
brainstorming with my friends with

201
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,598
myself and then I thought it was a good

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,918
one it was a catchy one you know yeah

203
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,279
for sure so getting into autoflowers I

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,079
think appropriate where to begin is

205
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,758
genetics genetics genetics yeah start

206
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,359
off with bad genetics you could have a

207
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,240
bad result right start off with good

208
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,000
genetics well your chances of having a

209
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
good result is a lot higher what are

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,199
some of the biggest yielding autof

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,439
flowers that you've grown and are there

212
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,520
any specific strains that you recommend

213
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,560
to get big yields so I'll talk I'll talk

214
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,478
out of experience because obviously you

215
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,360
know I can only grow so many plants at

216
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:59,079
once um so I'll talk out of experience

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,280
so my biggest yielder plant so far were

218
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:05,560
from three breeders so we got Mesto we

219
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,959
got a night ow by Jazz and then speedrun

220
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,360
with Ben um so my latest run which

221
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,519
harvested in uh January that was a

222
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,800
26.6 ounce Auto

223
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:22,560
Autoflower so and then the second would

224
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:28,800
be a 21 a half Ripley OG by Mesto and a

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,158
19 o plant by Nal again which was the

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,479
purple straw

227
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,399
popsicle so yeah they're all over a

228
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,200
pound and I seem to be able to reproduce

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,120
that pretty much every grow now I have

230
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,680
one uh ongoing right now which should be

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,320
over a pound as well so pound a oflow is

232
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,879
not Out Of Reach for most of everyone as

233
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,120
long as they know what they're doing 10

234
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,159
15 years ago it was out of the reach but

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,399
I think the genetics have been uh bred

236
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,838
to get higher yields so was the

237
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,759
26.6 O plant that you had was that the

238
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,000
largest yield bu one you've ever had

239
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,639
yeah yeah 26.6 I that was just last run

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,278
so I haven't I haven't beat that yet no

241
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,439
it's an incredible plant she was close

242
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,639
to six feet tall and four plants in a

243
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,880
5x5 and she was busting out of the it

244
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,039
was really really big plants yeah and

245
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,559
it's uh I don't use a trellis I probably

246
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,759
should I like to have my plants mobile

247
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,838
cuz I pick them up I bring them outside

248
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,480
for

249
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,360
defoliation uh to remove some some stems

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
that kind of stuff uh to take some

251
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,039
photos if I put a trailers if everything

252
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,078
is more immobile in the T then right so

253
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,719
I can't do what I want to do but at this

254
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,319
point in time I think it could be it

255
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
could be a good idea understood let's

256
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,440
get deeper into the equipment you use I

257
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,159
know you're growing indoors can you

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,959
describe the equipment setup that you

259
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,078
have in your indoor garden yeah I

260
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:58,078
mean it's really similar I'm going to

261
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,838
say to what everyone uses some people

262
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:01,639
use some higher Tech

263
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,959
equipment than me you know I'm sure

264
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,000
you're aware of those AC Infinity tents

265
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,239
that everything is you plug it in and it

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,600
adjusts the VPD the relative humidity

267
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,039
the temperature for you almost if you if

268
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,800
you have the

269
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:20,078
hardware I don't do that I'm uh I'm

270
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:22,120
analog I have uh sensors um at canopy

271
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,159
level that tells me what the temperature

272
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,078
and the relative humidity is but then I

273
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:31,439
also run a dehumidifier and a humidifier

274
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,838
depending on what my VPD tells me to do

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
uh for the most part but everything is

276
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,120
uh I do everything by hand I just look

277
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,000
at my data and I'll adjust it um and

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,399
then the autopot obviously is a big part

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,120
of my grow and I've used um I want to

280
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,839
say most of their system you know so I'm

281
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,679
I'm I'm an affiliate with them so they

282
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,240
they do help me out with some of the

283
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:59,759
equipment so I do run the 3.9 gallon

284
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,000
plastic I ran um

285
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,559
fabric pots as well and then the bigger

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,480
6.6 gallon plastic so they have

287
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,359
different sizes for um most of the time

288
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,680
the substrate that you're willing to use

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,320
with it and also fans everybody got fans

290
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,479
and I have multiple lights man like I've

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,720
learned the hard way I went from you

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:27,639
know Mars Hydro blurple I had t5s you

293
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,560
know I have uh the CMH uh 315 and now I

294
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,360
run LEDs but but uh some of these were

295
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,239
sponsored and some I bought out of

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,720
pocket so I still use the hlg qb96

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,799
there's are old school uh do-it-yourself

298
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,399
type lights that you assemble yourself

299
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,759
it was meant for like to do-it-yourself

300
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,000
crowd but I don't think it it it took on

301
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,600
all that much but it's a great light I

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,879
use four of those and it shoots on Max

303
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,519
probably like 650 watts and I still use

304
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:57,159
those lights up to now uh cuz they're so

305
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,759
small so I can really use one up to four

306
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,838
lights depending on the wattage I'm

307
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,078
looking for

308
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,079
but in the big 5x5 it's a photon Tech um

309
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,039
XD 1,00 watt I don't run it on Max

310
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,679
that's uh that's too much for a 5x5 so

311
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:17,319
at the most I'll use 750 watt for the

312
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:19,638
5x5 okay and so for the 4 hld DIY and

313
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,720
the photon Tech you have in your other

314
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,079
tent do you have like a par meter are

315
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,199
you like measuring the amount of light

316
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,879
that the plant is receiving or just kind

317
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,078
of going off of kind of the

318
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,198
manufacturer's recommendation

319
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,879
um I want to say I used to I don't have

320
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:39,479
a par meter everyone think it's really

321
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:44,559
crazy I have a photon meter um I think

322
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:47,720
it's Dr Dr Meen Dr Meter sorry and uh on

323
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,000
the hlg website way back then you there

324
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,879
was a calculation you could do to divide

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,039
um the Lux that came out of it divided

326
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,240
by 66 and it gave you an approximate

327
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,879
ppfd so I did do that for a while but

328
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,480
now that I know my grow and my my grow

329
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,759
tent and grow area so well I don't

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,879
really measure

331
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,919
anymore and I know it sounds crazy

332
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,559
people ask me all the time like hey

333
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,919
what's your ppfd targets what's your da

334
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,518
I'm like I don't I don't really do that

335
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,639
anymore but I I used to you know I I

336
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,039
went deep into it like looking into all

337
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,360
the information for ppfd DLI Lux all

338
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,919
that stuff you know and it's really

339
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,480
confusing I'll be honest for a lot of

340
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,519
people that start looking into the light

341
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,360
metrics extremely confusing stuff right

342
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,679
but I did do it yeah yeah that can be uh

343
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,199
super confusing to uh look at all the

344
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,078
numbers and not really know what you're

345
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,198
doing especially for a folk somebody who

346
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,759
is newer I know some people who reach

347
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,919
out to me all the time with questions on

348
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,198
lighting but uh yeah I guess it is a

349
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,319
little surprising it probably is a

350
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,120
little surprising for some people to

351
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,560
hear that you're not really dialing the

352
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,720
lights since you're having these massive

353
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,838
yields you know what I mean the how

354
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,120
about CO2 are you adding in CO2 that's

355
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,920
another thing that people add in order

356
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,240
to try to get a higher yield are you

357
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,120
supplementing CO2 at all or no typically

358
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,919
I am not though I have tried it and you

359
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
know what funny enough um now that you

360
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,559
mentioned that my previous girl with

361
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,079
like record level yield um I was

362
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,078
implementing

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,639
C2 typically am not I had a mother earth

364
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,079
uh bucket that's connected to a fan and

365
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,759
I would shoot see through at the bottom

366
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,039
and as the air gets sucked by my exhaust

367
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,039
fan it would climb up through the plants

368
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,240
right some people do the up down like

369
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,958
they have like those little um fungus

370
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,159
bags I don't know what they're called

371
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,198
and then they put it above the canopy

372
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,360
but this uh this bucket it was right on

373
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:42,159
the floor and it would it would it would

374
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,839
exhaust CO2 and I had like a I have a

375
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,439
CO2 meter so it actually did work but I

376
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,639
think it's only good for like uh six

377
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,480
months so I ran out and I I don't have

378
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,560
the top up uh for CO2 okay yeah I just

379
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,199
looked that up right now you talking

380
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,758
about the mother nature CO2 generator

381
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,599
the 5 L kit yeah that's correct it was

382
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,720
sent to to me by by autopot thanks

383
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,000
autopot and it seemed to work I yielded

384
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,440
it a lot last run um that was that was

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,839
two tents right a 5x5 and a 4X4 and the

386
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,160
total yield for eight plants was 110

387
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,240
ounces wow I wouldn't want to be in that

388
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,319
trim

389
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,480
jail we can talk about

390
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
that so the autopot system it's pretty

391
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,639
commonly known these days but how did

392
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,800
you find out about the autopod system

393
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,240
and can you walk us through the setup I

394
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,719
know we have a lot of new folks on here

395
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,399
that don't really know what the system

396
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,720
is how it works talk to us about that

397
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,360
okay so I have probably four years of

398
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,000
experience with a system now pretty much

399
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,199
every day I use it right um so my when I

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,879
first started growing I did hand feeding

401
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:53,879
I had two plants in soil two plants in

402
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:56,958
Coco my first grow 2018 right and um the

403
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,958
cocoa plants won hands down that contest

404
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:03,479
like my yield the plants were happy

405
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:06,439
um the plants produce more and I can't

406
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,278
say for like you know the tpine profiles

407
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,360
all that but to me at a time yield was

408
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,919
very important and also how easy the

409
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,600
grow was going to be um so long story

410
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,838
short for roughly two years I decide to

411
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,440
run coconut uh Coco core right and

412
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,519
that's hand feeding and hand feeding

413
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:31,880
cocoa is something else like you can't

414
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:34,120
hand feed um once a day typically in veg

415
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,278
or you can do two three times a day in

416
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,440
flour they'll take it all it's extremely

417
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,278
hard to overwater a plan in Cocoa like

418
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,319
you really have to I don't know if it's

419
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:46,600
possible um possible I've done it

420
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,078
possible I've done it y can you tell me

421
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,319
about it because I tried I'm like

422
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:54,078
watering them like two runoff 10 15%

423
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,958
runoff daily three four times a day

424
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,318
right but that comes to with the

425
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,159
inconvenience of having to first of all

426
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:04,480
do it and second uh you have to deal

427
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,240
with a runoff if you don't have a proper

428
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,519
system you have to go in there with a

429
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,120
shot back or something and that takes a

430
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,078
lot of effort it takes a lot of noise

431
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,599
and after you know two years of doing

432
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,838
that I'm over it like this is so much

433
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,480
work there has to be a solution and

434
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:25,119
browsing the internet I Came Upon

435
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,078
autopot um it's a bottom wicking system

436
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,798
it's basically a if you use the right

437
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:33,079
substract it is a form of hydrop

438
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,960
and um it worked my first grow with it I

439
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,279
grew the most incredible plants and it

440
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,480
was so easy you basically have to top

441
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,200
water a few days or after a while you

442
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,640
just add your nutrient mix to the

443
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,080
reservoir and then the plant basically

444
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,440
feed themselves so the way it works is

445
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,439
you have a tray and uh within the tray

446
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,720
there's a key part of the system it's

447
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,159
called the aquavalve and the aquavalve

448
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
will fill the tray uh with the the plant

449
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,080
in it with roughly an inch worth of

450
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,879
water and then a stop and it works by

451
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,918
ways of vacuum and gravity so there's no

452
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,400
power involved at this point and once

453
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,080
the plant drink down the whole inch of

454
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,720
water in the tray the aquavalve will

455
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,319
break the seal from the vacuum and it's

456
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,558
going to refill it back to one inch

457
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,519
that's it that's it you do not have to

458
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,279
hand water anymore just the first few

459
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,000
days but after that from the rest of the

460
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,918
grow you don't have to hand water and

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
you just add your nutrient mix if you're

462
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,960
using coconut to the reservoir and then

463
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,600
there's no runoff to deal with either so

464
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,600
typically because of the reservoir

465
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,119
system you can leave for a week five six

466
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,599
seven days at a time and the plants will

467
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:48,239
keep drinking as long as the reservoir

468
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:51,240
has nutrient water in it so what I do

469
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,000
when I go on a 7day work trip or a

470
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,120
vacation or something I'll F the

471
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,038
reservoir to its limit and I'll even

472
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,678
have another 5 gallon bucket beside it

473
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,480
for a neighbor to dump it in as it gets

474
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,679
low so that extends how long you can

475
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,880
leave so it's it's an amazing system and

476
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,440
you grow the most incredible plants on

477
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,799
coconut and it's uh I love it I just

478
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,919
can't go back you know because

479
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,000
previously if I wanted to go on vacation

480
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,679
my partner would have to go and feed

481
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,640
once two three times a day and Shop back

482
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,919
the nutrient the the runoff water so for

483
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,840
me it's uh it makes so much sense for a

484
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,200
homeg grower that's really busy to have

485
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:32,480
like kids um or that have like a a very

486
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,600
busy work schedule or they want to go to

487
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,079
the gym you don't have to think about

488
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,119
your plans just mix it dump it in you're

489
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,759
done you know so I've been using it for

490
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,239
the better parts so four years now and

491
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,720
it's it works so good it had to be as

492
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,038
part of my Instagram handle I love the

493
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,480
autopot system I have it as well I uh

494
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,359
actually I stopped using it probably

495
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,558
like a year or two ago just because I I

496
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,639
switched the blue mats but man every run

497
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,240
I had with that thing was great and I

498
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,200
really do need to just wipe the dust off

499
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,839
it and get it back in motion because it

500
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,558
is a fantastic system now I want to ask

501
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,399
you about what size Reservoir do you

502
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,639
have it connected to and are you since

503
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,519
it's a gravity fed system yeah are you

504
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,440
having the reservoir up a certain height

505
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:22,759
yeah I think the manual recommends um at

506
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:25,720
least 6 in on above the tray so I have

507
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:31,158
mine like on on a mil crate um and I'll

508
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:34,038
use one 13g reservoir per two plants and

509
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,120
uh comes midf flowering they drink

510
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,400
really fast right really really fast at

511
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,558
first like oh not much is happening and

512
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,759
by the time you're an early to midflower

513
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,038
it's incredible how fast they drink

514
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,158
which makes me think a lot of people are

515
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,599
probably underwatering their plants in

516
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,640
Cocoa they just they're just not aware

517
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,599
of how much they can drink these plants

518
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,720
is incredible and um yeah it's uh it's

519
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:01,079
amazing I literally I cannot go back um

520
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,159
um oh and they have multiple products

521
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,918
they have there's the tray to grow that

522
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,240
I use in the 4x4 and that one's

523
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,880
incredible it's just one aquavalve and

524
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,960
it's like a a plastic tray roughly 3

525
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,520
feet long with a wicking mat on it so

526
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,640
you can grow many different ways with it

527
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:23,000
you know I've tried um man the previous

528
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,480
girl I I tried two fabric bags two

529
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,679
gallon just to see I want to keep my

530
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,720
plant small I'm like I'm going to use

531
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,679
something small two gallon two Auto

532
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,558
flowers uh well one in each obviously

533
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,559
and they were both close to a

534
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:40,319
pound in two gallon cocoa just sitting

535
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,359
on top of this tray with one aquavalve

536
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,359
and I I legit started from scratch I

537
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,959
didn't even top water once nothing it

538
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,079
just put it there and then it just grows

539
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,159
right it's it's un it's amazing yeah

540
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,158
it's such a great system and so you

541
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,159
correct me if I'm wrong you said you

542
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,520
have cocoa in it and you just been Coco

543
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:59,000
the entire time or have you tried soil

544
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,558
uh I've tried soil my first grow and

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,679
just uh just this current grow I was

546
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,558
chatting with Jeremy at builda I'm like

547
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,038
hey man I'd like to try some living soil

548
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:10,359
it looks awesome it's dope just water in

549
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:13,519
the reservoir right so he shipped me up

550
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:17,000
uh some builda 3.0 with some amendments

551
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:19,200
same thing I grew I grew oh my God I

552
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,038
just harvest the Same expeditus by night

553
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,759
oh that was 17 ooun and uh what's the

554
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:32,038
other one the speedrun frosty cherios F3

555
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:34,119
that came at 12 in living soil um just

556
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,759
water in the rest and that's my first

557
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,678
living soil grow ever and I'm like this

558
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,519
is incredible I didn't do anything I

559
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,759
just added top water in the reservoir no

560
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,359
phing nothing so I don't have a lot of

561
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,000
experience with it but I feel I need a

562
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,278
couple more ons to have a really good

563
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,798
feeling for the reimen M how much

564
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:54,919
nutrient is left in the soil because to

565
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,319
me it's kind of like maging like with

566
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,360
with when you're mixing uh salt you're

567
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,798
measuring everything so every point in

568
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,119
time you know what goes into the system

569
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,759
because you purposely mixed it right but

570
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:09,239
with soil say you have two three grows

571
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,038
through living soil like how much is

572
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,079
left in there how much do you need to re

573
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,319
amend to me it's kind of a a mystery

574
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,639
right so that that that part that's not

575
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:19,839
quantifiable it's kind of cool but it's

576
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,759
like magic man I I love it yeah it's

577
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,319
completely different from Coco so you're

578
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,440
mostly growing in Coco now are you

579
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,399
adding in any Iration like some people

580
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,600
add in like per Life for example and

581
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,120
along with aration do you add any type

582
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,278
of amendments at all or you do an

583
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,639
assault based system for nutrients so

584
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:42,519
I'm I believe okay so this this is the

585
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,559
thing autopot a lot of people try to

586
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,759
copy me but they they need to have

587
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:51,119
basically the same setup as me for it to

588
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,879
work so a lot of people will try 100%

589
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:57,079
coconut cor like I do and they may have

590
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,159
issues because of the lack of ariation

591
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:03,359
so here's what I do I have the air doome

592
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,600
which is part of the autopot ecosystem

593
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,240
as as well as the air base at the bottom

594
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:12,959
of my pot and the air doome is connected

595
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,120
to an air pump so it adds oxygen at the

596
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,000
PO at the bottom of each pot that is

597
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,319
sitting within the tray right without

598
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,319
that aerodome you might run the risk of

599
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:27,480
suffocating or even overwatering your

600
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:30,759
plants so I've I've seen that happen so

601
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,919
uh I'm 100% cocoa fella a lot of people

602
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,119
uh would be would do just fine with some

603
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,320
added perlite in the mix like 50% or 30%

604
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,079
but I don't personally do that and then

605
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,639
what do you run for nutrients oh man

606
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,079
I've ran a variety of stuff kind of

607
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,759
similar to you you know uh being in this

608
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,240
field on on Instagram there's a lot of

609
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,240
company that that reaches out to you and

610
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,558
I'm like yeah I'll try some stuff so

611
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:59,079
I've tried a variety of nutrients you

612
00:24:53,558 --> 00:25:01,558
know uh from Athena to Canada to Mills

613
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,839
uh and I'm using right now a dried

614
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,558
powder line by Green Planet nutrients

615
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,959
called H te line it's brand new and um

616
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,639
it it's different in the sense that you

617
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,240
know a lot of people claim that um when

618
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,038
you buy a bottle nutrient most of it is

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,359
water so you're going to end up buying

620
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,960
more and more bottles and it weighs a

621
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:25,119
lot right so I'm like why don't I try a

622
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,960
different line um that's more DED salt

623
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,038
based I'm not sure if that's the right

624
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,319
terminology and it's seems to work so

625
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,919
basically you have your uh Reservoir

626
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,038
whatever how many guns you want to mix

627
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,480
in then you add your salt you mix it up

628
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:41,240
and then you pH to your Target and then

629
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,240
you're done and it's quite economical

630
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,519
because a bag of such powder nutrients

631
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,159
lasts for so many gallons you can mix so

632
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,679
much right but that's also the the very

633
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,120
scary thing about growing with Coco is

634
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,519
you you have to be able to um mix the

635
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,278
nutrients

636
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,359
properly which takes some practice but

637
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,480
you can you can learn anyone can learn

638
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,519
yeah the powder based ones are just so

639
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,079
convenient like you mentioned it goes

640
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,759
goes a long way and yeah I mean when

641
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,079
you're growing with the bottled

642
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,599
nutrients a lot of it is water you know

643
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,359
a large percentage I heard upwards of

644
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,119
98% of it being water yeah the powdered

645
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,918
form can definitely take you a little

646
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,038
bit further depending on which lineup

647
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,600
you're using so are you starting the

648
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,200
reservoir in like a low EC or I'm not

649
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,278
sure if you use EC or PPM starting low

650
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,480
and then kind of working your way up

651
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,960
throughout the grow or how do you do the

652
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,399
feedings yeah um what you say is correct

653
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,079
um I will start at a lower concentration

654
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,439
I use EC so I have like a it's called a

655
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,639
blue lab trunion I'm not sure if that's

656
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,798
how it's it's it's it's set because I'm

657
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,480
pretty French um the truncheon uh comes

658
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,278
out in two PPM formats a different scale

659
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,360
and there's also the EC scale so I use

660
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,679
the EC one because then you have to

661
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,798
think about the different scales that

662
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,798
are out there um all start pretty high a

663
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:02,839
lot of people people are they're quite

664
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,240
surprised when I tell them how high I

665
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:09,119
start my seedings we're talking 2.1 2.2

666
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,480
EC right off the bat the plant is like

667
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:16,519
just spr this big I'm like two

668
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,038
2.2 but you know plants being plants you

669
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,319
it's not just about the EC level the the

670
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,398
light needs to be at the right wattage

671
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,119
or di or ppf if you want as well and the

672
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,359
temperature and the relative humidity

673
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,839
everything needs to be right into for

674
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:33,278
the plant to be able to uptake that kind

675
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,359
of EC right else uh if you run like a

676
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,839
really small light you know like 25

677
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,959
watts because it's a Seedling and you

678
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,038
feed something 2.2 they're going to burn

679
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,960
they can't they can't process

680
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:48,240
it so personally I start them strong

681
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,679
right off the bat it's because these are

682
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,679
um I grow only autof flowers you know

683
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,640
and autof flowers being autof flowers um

684
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,960
to get big plants like I do you need to

685
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,679
perfect it needs to be perfect the veg

686
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,558
needs to be on point if the veg is not

687
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,440
on point and something happens to the

688
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,879
plant early on it will Fast flow on you

689
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,679
and if you have your plant you know this

690
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,399
big starting to flower it's only going

691
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,559
to end up being this big right so you

692
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,359
need it needs to be on point from day

693
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,440
one so that's the only tricky thing

694
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,000
about autoflowers yeah for those folks

695
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,480
listening on a podcast platforms he

696
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,798
mentioned this size to this side he was

697
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,640
do about 8 inches down up to 12 inches

698
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:31,278
or two feet at the max really yeah

699
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,519
that stunt that happens within the first

700
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:37,000
20 days any sort of deficiency really

701
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,558
holds back the plant I've had a handful

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,919
of autof flowers where it's like there's

703
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,599
this little bit of stunt and it totally

704
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,720
ruins the stretch and it and the overall

705
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,158
because it goes into flower like you

706
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,679
mentioned and then just starts flowering

707
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,000
and the stretch stops and all of a

708
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,000
sudden you're stuck with that size plant

709
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,359
no matter what throughout the rest of

710
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,679
flowering so it can be tricky yeah and

711
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,038
it I think it's going to be a little eye

712
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,640
opening for folks to realize that you

713
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:59,798
start with that high of EC and the

714
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,399
seeding stage now are you keeping that

715
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:03,240
for a period of time and then upping it

716
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:04,278
even further like in flowering for

717
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,359
example like what do you what do you

718
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:11,640
typically go up to um I want to say the

719
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:13,918
peak EC for me would be midflower so in

720
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,120
autoflow assuming for me a harvest is

721
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,440
typically day 90 plus or minus a week so

722
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,199
we're talking in the in the day 70s from

723
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,240
Sprout is roughly where my EC is on Max

724
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,038
so I'll be hitting close to like 2.8 2.9

725
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,079
EC so basic basically my range from 22

726
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:36,839
28 29 is what I typically do and as you

727
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,480
progress towards Harvest uh it lowers

728
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:43,000
back again towards the you know 2.3 2

729
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,839
2.4 it doesn't need to be crazy specific

730
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,200
but that's roughly it's roughly what I

731
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:50,038
do so midf flowering 2.8 and then a lot

732
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,840
of light that's your max light I'm

733
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:56,679
running 750 watts in the 5x5 and the 4x4

734
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,798
I'm close to 650 okay so load nutrients

735
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,519
are lowering towards the end of

736
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,720
flowering there and I take it you're not

737
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,200
doing any sort of like flushing of the

738
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,759
medium prior to harvest no I I don't do

739
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,240
that there's a lot of

740
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,359
misconception uh about it you know what

741
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,759
I don't know what's true or not but to

742
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,319
me it makes zero sense to flush out your

743
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,919
nutrients towards the last they're still

744
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,879
they're still living they still need

745
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,840
nutrients to grow um but they don't

746
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,919
uptake nearly as much so for the for the

747
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,439
purpose of like cost savings I'll lower

748
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,159
the EC but they're still growing I don't

749
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
see why you know in the Coco itself is

750
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,240
there's nothing and if you're you're

751
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,839
just flushing everything you're going to

752
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,120
mess up with the pH of the substr in

753
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:40,319
there as well and here's the other thing

754
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,119
I reuse my Coco so I don't want to strip

755
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,240
everything that's in there and have like

756
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,879
crazy pH spikes because I added just

757
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,679
plain water or pH water you reuse the

758
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Coco huh can you talk to us about how

759
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,038
you actually go about reusing are you

760
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,918
flushing that all out and then starting

761
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:57,079
fresh you just continuing on what you

762
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,759
left off with the nutrients so yeah no I

763
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:00,960
I'll pretty much start I'll have the

764
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:05,200
same regime from day one whether it's

765
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,720
new coco or reuse Coco um it's really

766
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,080
easy I'll just dump all my plants uh all

767
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,278
the containers into an action Packer or

768
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:15,319
something similar I'll let it dry and

769
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,359
then I'll remove all the roots with a

770
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,319
tennis racket or a squash racket so

771
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,798
there's no more roots and I'll fill my

772
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,200
pots and I'll give it a go again but

773
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:27,119
here's the one thing uh that people

774
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,240
don't really know or maybe they don't

775
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,439
know but they will know out but there is

776
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,278
some nutrient uh salt buildup in the

777
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,120
autopot system so that does happen

778
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:42,200
because it's bottom wicking and uh the

779
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:46,479
actual nutrients salt will um slowly

780
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,159
migrate to the top of the pot so people

781
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,759
will notice when they're growing autop

782
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,480
poot with cocoa there's always a bit of

783
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,720
like white stuff on top of the substrate

784
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,839
and that's basically salt builded up uh

785
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,440
so that does happen and but you won't

786
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,319
see many roots up at the surface it's

787
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,038
mostly happens way down where the air

788
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,480
doome and the water update actually

789
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,319
happens so it doesn't really hurt the

790
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
plant but something I've learned the

791
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,439
hard way the top of the cocoa has really

792
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,360
loose cocoa and it's white and it's uh

793
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,480
crusty somewhat do not use that cocoa to

794
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,599
start a Seedling you will burn the hell

795
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,798
out of them and I've done that you know

796
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,359
I was uh mixing some new cocoa mine

797
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,440
comes as brick because I live so remote

798
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,678
I don't order the big expended bags

799
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,600
because it's more expensive for shipping

800
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,240
so I'll buy like the compressed brick I

801
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,599
ran out of it and I'm like oh I just

802
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,759
need a bit more cocoa to fill the sings

803
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,240
Cups right so I grabbed some of the top

804
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,319
loose soil of an old grow and I burnt

805
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,798
the hell out of everything everything so

806
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,038
always start seedling with fresh Coco

807
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,079
like fresh fresh fresh good advice you

808
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:47,558
know I know there are some people

809
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,319
probably a little bit surprised that

810
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:52,079
you're reusing it over and over again

811
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,278
having success other people are a little

812
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,359
bit surprised that you're not actually

813
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,679
doing a full flush of the medium to

814
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:01,199
where you're trying to get back to to

815
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,679
really say zero PPM but like basically

816
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,960
no nutrition in there and then kind of

817
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,480
adding in your 2.2 EC or whatever

818
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,600
whatever you want to start with to begin

819
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,480
so um yeah it's cool interesting to hear

820
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,319
that your way of going about it and so

821
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,159
how many runs in a row has it been with

822
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,879
this batch of cocoa that you had oh man

823
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,159
like I I never stopped so that's like

824
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,360
four five six years six years worth of

825
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,080
cocoa eventually as you pull the roots

826
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,199
out you know and then sometimes I'll

827
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,398
I'll purposely Chuck like first 4 in of

828
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,798
like salt buildup away So eventually I

829
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,439
need to buy some more and keep cycling

830
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:37,440
but for the most part uh some of the

831
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,519
original Coco I bought six years ago is

832
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,798
still is still running in there so in a

833
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,839
way it's very economical right because I

834
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,158
don't I don't really waste my Coco it

835
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,638
goes right back to work as soon as I can

836
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,519
and this thing Coco is so inert man I've

837
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:55,038
had Coco sitting in the action Packer

838
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,038
outside all winter all fall uh sorry all

839
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,440
spring until until I is thought enough

840
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,679
that I can use it again and boom it

841
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,320
right it goes right back into my grow

842
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,798
that stuff is so inert nothing grows in

843
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:08,199
it there's no algae there's no mushrooms

844
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,679
nothing it's good to go right away I

845
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:14,358
love the medium so much and the specific

846
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,000
one that I buy doesn't really compress

847
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:19,199
nearly as other brands that you can buy

848
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,239
and I I'll let it know I buy canac Coco

849
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,759
bricks which is the same as the

850
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,559
Professional Plus but it's in a brick

851
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,159
format and it's been uh

852
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:32,119
pre-buffering again um um as you expend

853
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,320
it can is a big name and known for their

854
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,800
high quality products so that's good

855
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,639
stuff there let's get into plant

856
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,919
training next what do you typically do

857
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,599
for plant training if any on the autof

858
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,638
flowers I love this topic um man you

859
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,639
know when you browse Reddit or Instagram

860
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,519
and then you see people like bending the

861
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,358
plants out of shape from like is this

862
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,159
good bending and it's like they eight

863
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,078
and they're they're bending the plants

864
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,240
out of shape because supposedly it

865
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,960
yields more and all that um I've tried

866
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:06,439
it I I've tried it you know I I tried

867
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:11,039
training I tried those little 90s band

868
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:13,320
stuff um nowadays I I don't do any

869
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,000
training I don't do any training I don't

870
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,680
do any training and uh I let the plan

871
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,760
expresss as as they are and it doesn't

872
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,078
seem like my yields suffer at all you

873
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,400
know and I did topping too I tried all

874
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,160
that it doesn't to me it doesn't I don't

875
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,000
see any benefit so I don't really do it

876
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:36,399
anymore to be honest you know and I like

877
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,358
to I like to provide as limited stress

878
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,760
as I can to these all flowers and veg

879
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:46,039
you know so most of what I do comes

880
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,880
after the flowering stretch so we're

881
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,400
we're going to say like day uh 50s when

882
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,559
the stretch is over that's when I'll go

883
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
in there and start stressing them up

884
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,559
because they already they're already

885
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,240
almost a full size you know I'm trying

886
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,519
really hard not to stunt them is what I

887
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,118
do I'm in the same camp as you where I

888
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,280
do little to no training on autof

889
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,680
flowers you I've tried topping in the

890
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,880
past and it just hasn't been a good

891
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,799
result and versus when I don't top you

892
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,200
know now I do do low stress training and

893
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,880
bend down the branches and stuff like

894
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,598
that I do like doing that in order to

895
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,519
shape the plant and make sure it fits

896
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,960
within my grow space but that's it

897
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:22,318
really just the low stress train I'm not

898
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,519
doing any topping not doing any super

899
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,920
cropping no fimming no nothing like that

900
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,358
so and yeah seems like the more hands

901
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,240
off you are with that the less stunt and

902
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,838
growth and the higher the bigger the

903
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,838
plant the bigger the yield you can get

904
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:39,799
off of it I'm a big fan of leaf tucking

905
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,880
so what I'll do is under when you have

906
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,920
like a a newish plant you'll have your

907
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,720
plant like this and there's going to be

908
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,519
your sub branches on the side and

909
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,679
typically there's a giant leaf on top of

910
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,838
it that kind of restricts uh direct

911
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,679
light to the the growth the lateral

912
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,719
growth so what I'll do is I'll grab that

913
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,039
fan leaf and I'll tuck it under the

914
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:02,439
growth so the growth is exposed a direct

915
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:04,318
light and what I find is that these side

916
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,960
uh these side shoots are able to grow

917
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:10,759
nearly as tall as the main so most of my

918
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,400
plants do not have that Christmas sheet

919
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,599
Christmas tree shape where it's like a

920
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,639
big really big tall Cola and then some

921
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,318
lateral Branch like this most of mine

922
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,598
are somewhat even perhaps not exactly as

923
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,920
tall as the main but they're able to

924
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,800
grow pretty tall and that's kind of what

925
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,119
I'm looking for but um I don't do a lot

926
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,480
of uh training because I'm not trying to

927
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,720
yield um let's say more I yield enough

928
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,480
for what I'm trying to do and say

929
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,000
there's some popcorn or smaller buds it

930
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,800
just goes to the hash bow there's no

931
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,679
waste at the end of the day you know so

932
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,240
it doesn't really hurt my feelings that

933
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:47,199
some of the buds are smaller down there

934
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,679
it doesn't doesn't hurt me it goes into

935
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,838
hash B make some hash out of it so

936
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,838
you're not spending a whole bunch of

937
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,639
time doing lollipopping or stripping

938
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,679
that lower part and really trying to get

939
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,239
rid of that fluff or lar you just like

940
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:02,480
oh well my know using it elsewhere uh no

941
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:05,479
that's not true I I I do I do lollipop

942
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,599
quite rarely but you know there's like

943
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,760
some people care about the tops right

944
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,119
and then growing mids apparently it's

945
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,560
very uh it's almost like a bad word like

946
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,358
oh look at your mids but I don't

947
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,318
understand why people feel like that

948
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,400
once it's in your hand and it's cured

949
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,599
you cannot tell the difference between

950
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,880
you know especially when you cut them

951
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:26,480
down to like you know nug size I'm quite

952
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,760
happy partaking in the mid so I don't I

953
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,400
don't understand that so so there's like

954
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,960
uh mids and tops and then the super

955
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
super low stuff like say one foot and

956
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,280
below that gets that gets cut I I'll

957
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
I'll prune all that quite happily it

958
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
doesn't take much time at

959
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,359
all but I guess what I'm trying to say

960
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,000
is like once you have a finished product

961
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:52,078
whether it's like mids or tops or

962
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,280
whatever it's it's all fair play for me

963
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,519
I'm I'm quite having I'm quite happy uh

964
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,440
partaking in it yeah and Ian the yields

965
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,599
that you are putting out is massive you

966
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
know over a pound per plant that's

967
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,160
definitely something to talk about and

968
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,159
I've got to ask you about your Harvest

969
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,440
process first of all when do you like to

970
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:12,679
harvest these Autoflower plants and what

971
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,960
is your process for harvesting you know

972
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,199
walk us through a detail like the

973
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,639
cutting down process all the way to

974
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:25,759
getting into drying okay um for me

975
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:30,159
personally I'm about 75% about the butt

976
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,160
look there's a certain look to a flower

977
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:36,920
when it's ready that I'm looking for um

978
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:39,039
the cxis needs to be plump you know when

979
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,358
they're in midflower you can see them

980
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,400
all they're all nice and and shimmery

981
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,078
but there's a c certain plump look that

982
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm looking for that tells me the plant

983
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,880
is ready uh the stigmas are for the most

984
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,200
part orange and kind of retracted not

985
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,119
too many of the the newest flowers

986
00:39:53,199 --> 00:40:00,639
forming on top of it and finally about

987
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:05,640
25% is is based on uh triol ripness so I

988
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:08,078
look for 0% clear um the vast majority

989
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:11,279
milky SP by me and some Amber as well

990
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,359
but not just the top buds you have to

991
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
look at the mid the bottom have a feel

992
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,759
for the whole plant whether it's ready

993
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,720
or not so it's combination of all that

994
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,880
um but having growing in the same way

995
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:26,838
the same strategy for so long again it's

996
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,760
it's also based on days so if we're

997
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:32,639
closing on day 90 I'm looking a lot more

998
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,079
closely at my buds for for Harvest okay

999
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,879
and then I believe you cut the plant at

1000
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,519
the base if I remember correctly at

1001
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,440
least I seen you in your Instagram you

1002
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,119
love to hold that up uh the whole plant

1003
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,079
hole and get some good pictures I I love

1004
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,880
those picks are you then cutting

1005
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,200
individual branches and hanging them or

1006
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,200
are you just hanging the plant whole

1007
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,639
yeah I I cut uh branches sometimes the

1008
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:57,519
plants are huge right so it needs to be

1009
00:40:53,639 --> 00:41:00,799
a manageable size and I sadly do not

1010
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,318
have a dedicated room for drying so I'll

1011
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,519
use my grow room for drying but outside

1012
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:08,000
of tent and I've got like lines set up

1013
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:12,519
everywhere and I'll hang I'll hang the

1014
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,559
plants by branches and the whole idea

1015
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:19,880
here is I don't want buds to touch each

1016
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,679
other for uh mold purposes right so I'll

1017
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,400
have a room full of like individual

1018
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,598
branches all cut up and strung up

1019
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,559
together in my room and uh in terms of

1020
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,760
drying strategy I aim for 6060 but

1021
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:34,838
that's kind of hard it's kind of hard

1022
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,599
for me to get I'm hoping to get you know

1023
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,639
10 12 days but sometimes it's faster

1024
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,920
than that sometimes I have to get in

1025
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:46,559
there um before I even hit 10 days

1026
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,358
because I'm scared of overdrying which

1027
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:53,480
is where you you lose uh tpes if they're

1028
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:56,559
too dry right so um for me anyways I

1029
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,199
look for a smaller branch and if it

1030
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:02,679
almost snaps apps I'm about there and

1031
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:05,159
when I usually um jar them or back them

1032
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:10,078
I'm looking for above 62 relative

1033
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:13,920
humidity in that bag if it's below 55

1034
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,119
I'm losing tpin so I want to be in the

1035
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,119
high to

1036
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,838
mid-60s you know so I'd rather trim

1037
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,640
faster um than L let them hang for like

1038
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,279
10 14 days and they're just overdried

1039
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:28,719
and so you're putting them in bags and

1040
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,319
aiming for above 60% like you mentioned

1041
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,719
RH I used to jar them and that takes so

1042
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,719
much effort I'm sure you're aware of the

1043
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:39,318
growth bags yeah oh yeah so I use growth

1044
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,519
I use one pound growth bags now for most

1045
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:44,039
of my work because the B the the jars

1046
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,159
are insane you have to open them daily

1047
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,639
for like a week and it's just so much

1048
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,358
effort right so I've been using growth

1049
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,519
bags for possibly the last two years now

1050
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,440
and it it works fine it looks great grow

1051
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,199
bags are a game changer yeah because you

1052
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,720
don't have to do that burping process

1053
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,598
like you have to do with jars it just uh

1054
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,598
it's able to escape that bag by itself

1055
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,519
now are you heat sealing it as well I

1056
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,039
know said people swear by heat sealing

1057
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,920
it versus just the regular seal what are

1058
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,800
you doing uh lately I have not but I

1059
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,920
have heat sealed and to be honest I

1060
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,880
haven't really found lots of differences

1061
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,119
between heat sealing the bag or actually

1062
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,039
just not doing it you know but for some

1063
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,720
of uh if I have overdried some buds I'll

1064
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,599
put a bito pack in they're 62% as well

1065
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,879
and then what size bags you I'm assuming

1066
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,880
bigger bags which size Grove bags I

1067
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,838
think they're I think they're pound bags

1068
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,838
or half a pound bags if I can't remember

1069
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,639
yeah those Grove bags are are awesome

1070
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:45,000
I've been using the um canol which is

1071
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,358
the system that yeah pretty good system

1072
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,920
very expensive though I mean I can't

1073
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,480
recommend anybody go buy it because it's

1074
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,599
just so much money it's so much money I

1075
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,480
think it's 1600 I was talking to someone

1076
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,680
yesterday I think he got like 14 or

1077
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,519
1,600 USD which is close to like 2,000

1078
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,118
can he I'm like man and I need I would

1079
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,440
need like three of

1080
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,318
those you know so I'm like I don't know

1081
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,519
if I'm going to go that route I'm I'm

1082
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:10,358
not rich like that you know yeah it's a

1083
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,559
lot of money but I wish I had one yeah

1084
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:14,078
it it does make things a lot more easier

1085
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,800
because you just cut up the branches

1086
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,599
individually place them in there and

1087
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,240
then it dries and cures dries and cures

1088
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,000
yeah so dries it's going to bring you

1089
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,959
right down to that 60 62% whatever you

1090
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,760
kind of set it to and then you have that

1091
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,960
shelf stable and it just stays at that

1092
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,319
it's awesome but uh I can't say I

1093
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,318
recommend it just because of the the

1094
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:38,159
price it's just it's just so much money

1095
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:41,318
you know pricey but I want one so

1096
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,719
bad so that's Harvest dry and cure for

1097
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:45,440
you I want to get into common

1098
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,239
misconceptions about

1099
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,159
autoflowers there there's just like

1100
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,719
anything in life there's uh pros and

1101
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:57,279
cons right

1102
00:44:53,719 --> 00:45:00,759
so I I like them a lot um I get the

1103
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,599
yield that I'm looking for um the

1104
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,640
product itself is great THC level is

1105
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,400
great I sent a bunch for testing one

1106
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:13,318
came out as like 298 or something like

1107
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,280
that you know um but here's one big

1108
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:19,279
misconception and it's relevant to the

1109
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,359
fact that it's easy for

1110
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,640
beginners autof flowers are harder for

1111
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:27,480
beginners because you not you lose the

1112
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,598
ability to uh veg for as long as you

1113
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,159
want and you lose the ability to flower

1114
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,680
when you think they're ready to be

1115
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,639
flowered right so they are not better

1116
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,719
beginners you can grow a plant but will

1117
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:42,358
you be happy with the yield and the end

1118
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:46,639
product possibly not if you're brand new

1119
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:49,880
in the game right I agree with you 1,00%

1120
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:54,318
on that one for those exact

1121
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:57,680
reasons yeah um but I I I focus on aut

1122
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,079
of flowers because exactly for reason

1123
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,679
because people grow really really small

1124
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,359
all the flowers and I'm out there

1125
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,159
showing that it doesn't need to be that

1126
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,358
way if you are dialed in like I am you

1127
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,118
can grow really really big plants and

1128
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:15,318
and just be like hey look at this plant

1129
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:18,838
anyone grown in 90 days um an one

1130
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:22,679
benefit for for example is they can grow

1131
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:24,719
under 24 and0 you do not need to rest

1132
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,440
which is another misconception people

1133
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,318
are like everything needs to rest in

1134
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,318
life I'll give them two hours of

1135
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,400
Darkness because they need to rest I'm

1136
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,519
like that's not true you're kind of

1137
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,559
losing the benefit of outer flowers

1138
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,280
these guys can express themselves they

1139
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,960
can grow under 24 and0 so as long as you

1140
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,359
give them as much light as they can

1141
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,800
possibly take they will grow huge right

1142
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:50,400
they don't need that Darkness at all I

1143
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,000
live in the subarctic in the summertime

1144
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,318
there's no Darkness you know there's and

1145
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,679
that's where these plants come from for

1146
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:00,239
the first place rumors has it I don't

1147
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,639
know if it's true that uh the creator of

1148
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,639
autof fliers grabbed these genetics from

1149
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,400
rud rales plant out of Russia in

1150
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,960
Northern Russia where it is similar

1151
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,519
environment as me where in the

1152
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,679
summertime is really short and there's a

1153
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,358
lot of light and it's not the season

1154
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,639
that will dictate whether you need to

1155
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,639
procreate or not it's like

1156
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:25,558
time you know we got to go now because

1157
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:29,199
there's not much time left so um yeah so

1158
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:33,760
those those are the two big ones um is

1159
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:37,799
it true that photo period um have better

1160
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,240
genetics than autofs 100% photo period

1161
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,960
have been readed for so much longer so

1162
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:46,239
they're way ahead of the curve in terms

1163
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,318
of genetics potency and turpine profiles

1164
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,399
all that right but with all these new

1165
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,279
breeders coming up doing some proper

1166
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,400
work they're catching up really fast So

1167
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,839
eventually you're going to see some

1168
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,440
autof fers with some crazy t on number

1169
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,880
if that's what they're breeding for and

1170
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,079
also a very interesting tpping profile

1171
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,920
you know the same expeditus that I'm

1172
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,640
growing right now has like a a sweet

1173
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,599
beet SL carrots tpine profile that comes

1174
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,799
from you know a land RAC train AF call

1175
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,599
zal so there's some really cool stuff

1176
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,519
going on out there so I'm I'm quite

1177
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,760
happy growing them in the future going

1178
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,639
going for you're inspiring me to get

1179
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,040
back into autoflowers to be honest with

1180
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,519
you I took a little break from

1181
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:31,838
autoflowers but the takeaways in this

1182
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:34,119
episode is autopot system three things I

1183
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:38,960
want to say you know for me uh part of

1184
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:42,200
My Success quality genetics cocoa core

1185
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,760
um and autopots those three combined is

1186
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:48,318
a really really solid start you know um

1187
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,119
we can talk about white label genetics

1188
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:53,719
or strains if you want but what I would

1189
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,240
advise is to buy straight from the

1190
00:48:53,719 --> 00:49:00,159
Breeders if you can if not there are

1191
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:02,598
thirdparty um websites or seat banks

1192
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,279
that can provide the same genetics but

1193
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:08,200
if you go on Google and you type best

1194
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,599
auto flowering strains a lot of sketchy

1195
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:13,798
stuff comes up and I cannot advocate for

1196
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:17,200
that because genetics is the base of it

1197
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:20,559
all you need to know you need to procure

1198
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:22,960
seeds from a known breeder someone that

1199
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,280
you know is behind the scene actually

1200
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,159
thinking about the breeding and

1201
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,640
selecting the plants and doing the

1202
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,519
Crossing not just hype from a company

1203
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,480
that you don't even know who the breeder

1204
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,599
is you know I completely agree any other

1205
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,199
advice for beginners that maybe somebody

1206
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,920
who's just getting started growing Auto

1207
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:41,639
flowers any takeaways that they could

1208
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,000
have yeah that that's that's a really

1209
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:47,679
tough one a lot of beginners even myself

1210
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,318
like years ago you would go on on Reddit

1211
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:53,399
and then you would look for information

1212
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:56,318
and there is an insane amount of um

1213
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,639
misinformation out there you know even

1214
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,639
stuff like we talked about like

1215
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:03,159
flushing and training and light

1216
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:08,558
schedules and that kind of stuff there

1217
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:11,598
is so much bad info um I would advocate

1218
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,400
for kind of like following someone kind

1219
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,119
of like yourself that can provide the

1220
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,798
proper information and just follow it to

1221
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,920
a te you know because if you listen to

1222
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,318
like too many people are reading too

1223
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,119
much information from who knows what

1224
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,000
you're going to end up with terrible

1225
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:31,559
advice so I'd follow to I'd probably

1226
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,318
suggest to find a good source and then

1227
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,400
follow that and that should be

1228
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:37,400
sufficient to get um some really nice

1229
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,599
flowers good advice and I think for

1230
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,240
autof flowers the best person to follow

1231
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,200
is autop potimus ever heard of

1232
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,919
him I do a good job you know and uh I've

1233
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,000
been doing this for a while and I'm I'm

1234
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,480
happy showing the process people know

1235
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,679
it's just not a fluke I've been doing

1236
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,280
this for many years you know and I show

1237
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,199
the process from like seedlings all the

1238
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,798
way to harvest right

1239
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,159
yeah for sure I mean I spoke about your

1240
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:02,400
Instagram a couple different times and

1241
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,679
it's it's incredible really really great

1242
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,480
results to see in there awesome pictures

1243
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,838
and big fish too you even threw some

1244
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,639
fish photos in there was Prett cool to

1245
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,960
see yeah we like her fishing up here for

1246
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,838
sure awesome last question I'll hit you

1247
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,039
with oh actually second to last question

1248
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:20,599
future of autof flowers what do you see

1249
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,838
as the future for autof flowers from a

1250
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,559
breeding and a cultivation aspect the

1251
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:29,679
first thing I want to say is um all the

1252
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:33,160
flowers are great for for many things um

1253
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:35,519
bitc con is you can't clone them say you

1254
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:37,159
have like a really cool plant and you

1255
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,639
want to keep growing over and over

1256
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:42,639
because it was so awesome that's one of

1257
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,318
the biggest thing uh is you cannot keep

1258
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,000
a mother plant all the flower uh it's

1259
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:48,558
just going to flower on you and then you

1260
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
can't clone it you can't do nothing like

1261
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:56,880
that however um you can collect

1262
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,798
seeds so I do that a lot of people do

1263
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,798
that and that's a super cool aspect of

1264
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:04,119
it there's a lot of strains that are in

1265
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:07,519
demand and sometimes they come and go

1266
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,760
and uh I see people collecting an insane

1267
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,119
amount of cool genetics so I I really

1268
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,839
really actually like that you know

1269
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,519
trading seeds with people it's a it's a

1270
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:20,279
big hobby of mine uh but in the future I

1271
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:23,440
can only see um the genetics progress

1272
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,000
and potentially get better and better um

1273
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,798
each time you know bigger plants uh

1274
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
faster Harvest maybe cooler

1275
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:35,599
tpin um and more stability as well um so

1276
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,280
there's a there's a lot of like Hy uh

1277
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,838
photo pared strain as well that can be

1278
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,920
bred into autoflowering so I'm looking

1279
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,279

00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,318
you so much for those folks that

1332
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,798
contribute through patreon Lynn thanks

1333

so much for coming on to the podcast

1334
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,920
this was great like I mentioned there's

1335
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:45,679
a lot more that could be said I don't

1336
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,798
even think we got into environment right

1337
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,879
we could have been a whole conversation

1338
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:52,000
about that and you know there it's not

1339
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,599
just growing with salt-based nutrients

1340
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,199
but people are doing it with Organics as

1341
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,880
well so there are so many different ways

1342
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,639
you can grow autoflowers

1343
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,200
I think we could potentially continue on

1344
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,358
the conversation in the future

1345
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:04,118
absolutely if you'd like to if the folks

1346
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:05,759
demand a part two if you want a part two

1347
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:07,079
let us know down in the comment section

1348
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,680
below and also let us know in the

1349
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,760
comment section what do you do that's

1350
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,440
special when growing autof flowers is

1351
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,960
there particular light spectrum that

1352
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,880
you're going after amount of light

1353
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,720
medium so on and so forth so drop it all

1354
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,680
