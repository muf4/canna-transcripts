1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
coming up on garden talk bone meal

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:08,000
breaks down a little slower compared to

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,280
fish bone mail so if you're going to add

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,199
for bloom flour getting the fruit blood

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,759
meal is one you want to add kind of in

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,919
that transition over from your veg into

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,679
the flower state it's beneficial but

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,000
it's really helping more the biology

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,198
they say it's helping the terpenes i

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,079
didn't see an improvement in the

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,118
terpenes to me when i use the product

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,959
if you don't have protozoa or the other

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,880
biology that help eat the bacteria and

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,799
fungi your nutrients are being locked up

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
and stored up they're not being helpful

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,399
to the plant micromacro nutrients are

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
very important because without this we

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
don't have certain balances happening

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,718
within the plant they can't stay in a

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
homeostasis

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
if they're low on something it's going

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
to cause them to start reacting

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,718
differently

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
what's up everybody if you that don't

25
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,479

exactly so yeah we're gonna continue to

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,120
talk about the organic dry amendments to

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,599
use in your garden um for those that

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
don't know who you are can you do a

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,520
quick introduction

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,120
yeah so i am a living soil cultivator

123
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,399
i've been

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,399
cultivating since

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,960
mid 2000 2010 11ish

126
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,360
when i lived out in las vegas nevada

127
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,120
and ever since then i've continued to

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,919
kind of research and want to know more

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,680
and more about the plant and

130
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,240
about the soil uh i look at

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
it being like a symbiotic relationship

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
of one

133
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,000
so i wanted to know more about it and so

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,720
it set me on my journey and my youtube

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,478
kind of video creation of just putting

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
out videos for like video logs for

137
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,319
myself

138
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,159
and it turned into more than that okay

139
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,680
so let's pick up where we left off

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,560
talking about the various amendments or

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,879
organic inputs to use let's start with

142
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,038
alfalfa meal can you talk to us about

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,959
that what is it what are the benefits

144
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,918
and how do you apply it to your garden

145
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,239
so alfalfa meal is basically the

146
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:32,399
byproduct of them breaking down alfalfa

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,720
for either feed or essential oil extract

148
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,079
fatty extracts things like that

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
and

150
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,560
what you can use it for is to

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
kind of feed your plants

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,079
it still has

153
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,919
plenty of the

154
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,918
npks it's got some micro macronutrients

155
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
it also has a hormone called

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,800
trichantinol

157
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,839
and trichantinol is really a plant

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,280
growth regulator or plant growth hormone

159
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,399
it helps the plant finish a little

160
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,279
faster

161
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,478
it helps with some of the root root

162
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,318
expansion um

163
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,879
but alfalfa

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,879
it uh it kind of helps with this oil

165
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,719
amendment uh building the biology the

166
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,800
they like to break it down it helps with

167
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,800
some protozoa

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,038
especially if you do it in a tea

169
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
so alfalfa milk is really great i like

170
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,680
to i

171
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,439
like to use it throughout my whole grow

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,319
feeding my plants

173
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,000
but when my plants are going into

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
fruit flower stage

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,279
sometimes i bump it up a little bit more

176
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,599
trying to help them ripen a little

177
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,679
faster finish up a little faster

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,560
uh something about the trichtanol seems

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,519
to help them do that a little bit

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,879
so

181
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,038
i can

182
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,319
say harvest my tomatoes a little bit

183
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,839
quicker than

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,520
say the 45 50 days it might i might be

185
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,638
able to do a little sooner and what's

186
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,519
the application rate for that uh

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,879
application rate is like a tablespoon

188
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,560
per gallon

189
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,879
but if you're doing a top dress

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,959
sometimes you have a five gallon pot so

191
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,519
you you probably use you know a couple

192
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,000
tablespoons

193
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,000
if you're making a super soil depends on

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
the cubic foot because then you're

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,560
talking a couple cups to you know three

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,759
and a half to six cups

197
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
uh

198
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,598
you can make it into a tea

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
down to earth

200
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,439
likes to state that you can't make teas

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
out of their products but

202
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,918
it's a soluble you can

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,038
it breaks down over time so you can

204
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,120
extract and make teas with them

205
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,639
so there's uh three different ways you

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,199
could really apply it you can actually

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,038
do a foliar spray if you wanted to

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
and apply it that way

209
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,959
awesome i actually mixed in some alfalfa

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,199
with my fox farm ocean forest soil so

211
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,478
the bag slow and that's already

212
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
you know quote

213
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,120
hot soil right so it's already got tons

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639
of amendments in there yeah and so

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,399
a lot of people were surprised that i

216
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,720
added in alfalfa with it actually added

217
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,439
in alfalfa and insect frass

218
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
and we'll get into insect frass here in

219
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,959
a little bit

220
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,639
but um i had i got some really really

221
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,560
good results off of that and that was

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,038
just the veg stage right

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
but it wasn't too hot

224
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,839
and

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
i did hear that alfalfa male in

226
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,279
particular somebody had mentioned that

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,598
you should avoid using it in flour for

228
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,278
some reason is that just bro science

229
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,000
far as i understand it's bro science

230
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,439
i've never had a problem using alfalfa

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,839
in my flower stage ever and i've used it

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
10 plus years more

233
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
and

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,879
i i highly talk about it and a lot of

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,639
the videos about using alfalfa and

236
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,120
trichano especially in flour to help

237
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,360
them finish up quicker

238
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
in a living soil

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
uh bed

240
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,799
my plants seem to really start finishing

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,320
anywhere around day 50 to 60.

242
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,799
63 to me it's almost going over

243
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,879
or the point i like but

244
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,838
that's kind of what that does and what

245
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,120
trichtanal as a plant growth regulator

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
kind of helps the plant do it's supposed

247
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,639
to help it finish

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
it's supposed to ripen i think a lot of

249
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,919
people hear plant growth regulators or

250
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,079
pgrs and they kind of

251
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,639
they proceed with caution right because

252
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,920
there is a pgr out there that is uh

253
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,679
known as a carcigen right yes well and

254
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,679
that's the one thing

255
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,519
the difference between organic and

256
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,599
other products that are chemically

257
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
changed to get that

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
that hormone

259
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,120
with organics most most of these are

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,640
natural plant like

261
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,639
cytokines and

262
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
oxens and

263
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,080
uh tricantinol

264
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,479
these all

265
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
happen within the plant and they're all

266
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,519
organically part of the plant so there's

267
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,439
not much you can do to get away from

268
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,039
them using these

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
and it's not

270
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,799
in the sense like hey i'm going out and

271
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,440
i'm finding this bottle of this plant

272
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,479
growth regulator to help my plant just

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
do all this crazy growth no that's not

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
the purpose of it that makes sense let's

275
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,519
move on to back guano so it's something

276
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,519
that's uh very commonly used i know

277
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
there's a ton of different guanos bat

278
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,039
guano in particular seems to be very

279
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
popular

280
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,399
um i believe that it's high in nitrogen

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,278
can you talk to us about bat guano kind

282
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,278
of

283
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,360
you know what it is the benefits

284
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,120
application rate so on and so forth yeah

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
so you have bat guano and you have

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,240
siguano both of them are high in

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,959
nitrogen and phosphorus um

288
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,560
bat guano

289
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,719
it's

290
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,879
you're looking at it as the bat is more

291
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,639
of an herbivore eating small insects and

292
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,879
bugs

293
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,199
compared to

294
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,439
like sea birds sea birds

295
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,360
they can eat different

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,480
like not just small they'll eat fish

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,000
you know different insects sometimes

298
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,680
small animals

299
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,639
uh just depends on the the sea bird

300
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,319
but

301
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,399
the

302
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
the bat guano a lot of people look for

303
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,958
it to use a lot of the flower helping

304
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,120
with soil biology

305
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,239
it helps with the soil biology because

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,039
they like

307
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,839
the guanos they like the the frost the

308
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,159
poop the manure

309
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,680
manures are higher in nitrogen higher in

310
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,679
phosphorus

311
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,078
and that's where a lot of people

312
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,439
like those especially in flour i

313
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,638
personally don't use a lot of guanos

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
i've always

315
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,278
felt that they've gave my plant kind of

316
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,159
a odd taste

317
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,639
and i wasn't sure if it was

318
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,519
the guano itself or

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,560
the cure method but when i took it out

320
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,320
of like my super soil recipe

321
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,159
i don't get that same taste that i used

322
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,879
to get using guanos so some people

323
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,879
do some people don't use it

324
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,120
it just depends on your preference and

325
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,838
down to earth they have one right yep

326
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,240
they have one theirs is something like a

327
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,680
731 i think something like that okay

328
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
gotcha

329
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,838
how about blood meal can you talk to us

330
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
about that blood meal

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,760
if you're

332
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
veganic or vegan you don't want to use

333
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,759
blood meal it's made by animal

334
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,200
byproducts

335
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,519
blood meal is fast acting

336
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,920
like an amino acid type

337
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,879
nitrogen

338
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,039
that if you're top feeding

339
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,519
your plants or making it into a tea it's

340
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,120
going to help your plants

341
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,919
take up nitrogen a little faster

342
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,759
compared to say like feather meal where

343
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,278
it's a slower breaking

344
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,759
down

345
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,000
amendment versus the blood meal so if i

346
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,519
put blood meal in my pot i can expect

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
within

348
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,278
a week to two weeks it's pretty well

349
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
broken down into the soil and the

350
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,278
biology starting to break it down

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,519
allowing the plant to uptake it there is

352
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,919
some solubility to it so when you do put

353
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,360
it with water or top dress and add water

354
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,159
some of it's going to get released right

355
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
away so your plants can utilize it

356
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,679
but

357
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
to me it's one of the things that i do

358
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,039
use

359
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,720
especially in my veg state qrikmit from

360
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,480
wrong but this is one of the amendments

361
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,639
where there's quite a bit of controversy

362
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
around it as far as people talk about

363
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
organic

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,839
organic amendments and they're like well

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,959
blood meal isn't organic because of the

366
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,000
source

367
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,319
and you know what were the animals fed

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,839
and so on and so forth is that right

369
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
that's part of it

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,320
so here's my response everything's

371
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,320
organic chemistry when it breaks down

372
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,759
it's organic in nature

373
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
it's carbon-based

374
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,039
so these amendments that are

375
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,799
carbon-based and all of these are

376
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,439
carbon-based and that's kind of a source

377
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,439
of nutrients our plants need

378
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
um

379
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
i

380
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
like that

381
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,039
versus

382
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,320
hey it's came from a cow and it was

383
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,399
slaughtered

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,440
and it went through this whole horrible

385
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,679
process just to get it

386
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
um well the cow is going to be

387
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,000
slaughtered anyhow

388
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
for the butcher to produce meat for

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
people that want to eat it

390
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,359
this is some of the byproducts that

391
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,959
they're just going to throw away

392
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,039
so instead of it sitting there

393
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,879
decomposing bringing in bad pathogens

394
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,360
they're using it and breaking it down

395
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,759
and making it into

396
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
an amendment or something that you can

397
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,278
use to

398
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,519
top dress your you know your soil and

399
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,759
help condition your soil because the

400
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,399
biology they love it

401
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,679
they really like what it does

402
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,600
it really helps them with

403
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,000
getting that ready to

404
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
be taken up by the plants

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
bone meal is next on the list and i

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,559
could imagine there's some similarities

407
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
between blood meal and bone meal can you

408
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,239
talk to us about bone meal yeah so

409
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,679
there's a couple different types of bone

410
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,278
meal you have bone mild then you have

411
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,679
fish bone meal both of them are pretty

412
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:31,278
high in phosphorus that's one of them

413
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,278
that i really enjoy using

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,959
bone meal breaks down a little slower

415
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:41,359
like a slower release

416
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:43,198
phosphorus compared to fish bone male so

417
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
it's a great deal that if you're going

418
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,719
to add for

419
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,639
bloom flour getting the fruit

420
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,040
bone milk is one you want to add kind of

421
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,039
in that transition over from your veg

422
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,319
into your flower and into the flower

423
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,759
state

424
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
because plants are really looking for

425
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,278
phosphorus

426
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,879
and that's really a good source for them

427
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,799
to find it that's

428
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,799
to me a nice organic

429
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,039
there's other amendments you can use

430
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,679
still for phosphorus but

431
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,958
bone meal or fish mill um

432
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,879
i like them i i i think what the biology

433
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,518
in the soil how it helps them

434
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,799
beneficially is the reaction i'm looking

435
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,198
for and not so much that oh it's derived

436
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,599
from a fish or it's derived from an

437
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,758
animal you know from bones

438
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
bone meal is more that phosphorus you

439
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
still have some nitrogen to it but it's

440
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
more that phosphorus and that's when

441
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,120
your plants are producing the fruits

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,159
flowers and they're looking for that

443
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,720
phosphorus and not just potassium

444
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,559
and so that's where adding that to me

445
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,480
like in that transition

446
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,479
of from veg over in the flower state and

447
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
then into flower

448
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,039
first couple weeks

449
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,838
is uh

450
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,000
a good recommendation for it not so much

451
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,839
not i mean plants like phosphorus for

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,679
helping with like rooting and

453
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,480
other growth

454
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,640
but to me it's not crucial where you

455
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,318
know you're looking for certain flowers

456
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
to develop and be

457
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,438
dense and full

458
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,279
and so like certain points of

459
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,880
a plant's growth

460
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,798
and their life cycle it's you're trying

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,280
to hit certain nutrients

462
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,599
trying to help with that so they they

463
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,359
get a better production during you know

464
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,159
like the tomato wanting to produce more

465
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,639
tomato spots or starts that's kind of

466
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,240
what i mean by that more sights

467
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
yeah one thing i learned is that

468
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,880
phosphorus you know you hear about it

469
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,960
being uptaken and flowering it's

470
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,360
actually part of the biomass right so

471
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
the actual flowers are mostly

472
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,678
phosphorous so

473
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,479
yeah very important how about cottonseed

474
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,038
meal now cottonseed meal it's derived

475
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
kind of like alfalfa it's it's a

476
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,000
byproduct

477
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,200
there's some trace minerals to it not a

478
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,400
lot of npk there's a little bit

479
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
but it's mainly like protein

480
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,798
and proteins are what amino acids when

481
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
they're broken down

482
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,798
and so

483
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,959
that's where i'm looking at it from

484
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,038
it's good to add for the soil

485
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
conditioning to help build the soil

486
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,558
biology

487
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,558
plant use it's it's like the amino acids

488
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,359
that plants are looking for

489
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,678
to help like the building blocks of

490
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,199
leaf tissue and cell development and

491
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
things like that so

492
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,519
it's a great use but do the plants

493
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,759
actually uptake the amino acids it's got

494
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,079
to be broken down so that's where the

495
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,160
biology really helps out

496
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,038
your plants still take up amino acids

497
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
like

498
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,279
uh keto life makes a product called

499
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
green nine which is a amino acid

500
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,480
nitrogen complex

501
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,640
um that it's soluble so it will take up

502
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,480
um just add it in water and water it in

503
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,720
or even top dress

504
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,558
cod seed mill similar to that it's it's

505
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,120
not so soluble like this powder form the

506
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,038
green nine but once the water hits it

507
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,879
and the biology kind of breaks it down

508
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,480
it's gonna make it plain available in

509
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
amino acid form

510
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
now is it safe to use throughout the

511
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
entire grill or should you only use it

512
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,519
in veg or only use it in flour for

513
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,000
example

514
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,839
i would use it through veg and partial

515
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,240
flour like the beginning stages and kind

516
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,439
of wean off because you're not gonna

517
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,640
your plants don't seem to use

518
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,558
in my opinion the amount of amino acids

519
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,280
laid in flour as they do

520
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:38,160
during flower development okay gotcha

521
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,160
let's move on to crab meal what is crab

522
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
meal and what are the benefits of it so

523
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
crab mill similar to like what oyster

524
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
shell is it's

525
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,880
the crust up

526
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,840
like outer shells of crap

527
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,039
it's

528
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:55,279
kind of like kitenase chitin in a sense

529
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,319
how do i describe it because oyster

530
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,480
shell has a lot of like calcium to it so

531
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,599
this is going to be similar

532
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,360
but

533
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,639
crab

534
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,359
is similar to like crustacean meal

535
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,200
they both help with the salicylic

536
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,199
jasmonic kind of

537
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,840
part of the plant the self-defense

538
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,319
mechanism because the chitinates

539
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,720
they're great for calcium

540
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:24,240
so when your plants looking for calcium

541
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,319
outtake especially during bloom flower

542
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,720
uh fruit production

543
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,960
uh it's that's really when it's going to

544
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,759
be kind of like beneficial

545
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,600
getting more calcium into the soil or

546
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,200
it's better to kind of mix it up it's

547
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,839
harder to

548
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,279
make it into a tea

549
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,399
it takes way too long to break down

550
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,240
like

551
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,880
anything that's like

552
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,079
a calcium a crust a shell

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,840
it's hard

554
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,480
and so it's going to take a while to

555
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,480
break down similar to what egg is

556
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,919
so like a lot of people use egg for

557
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,679
example and like compost well when

558
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,919
you're doing the whole shell it takes a

559
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,640
while for that all that calcium to be

560
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,120
broken down in the biology to actually

561
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,600
break it up it's similar with

562
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,519
crab meal crustacean meal what is the

563
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,599
application rate for that i imagine that

564
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,119
like a lot of these products i think a

565
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,719
lot of folks are

566
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,558
used to bottled nutrients and having to

567
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
do like a half dose for example but a

568
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,960
lot of these organic amendments

569
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,038
i believe correct me if i'm wrong that

570
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,038
you can generally go by

571
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,839
what it says on the instructions is that

572
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,240
true or false i would agree with that

573
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,079
the reason being is they all break down

574
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,880
a little differently

575
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:43,359
so when you're doing bottled nutrients

576
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,000
you're it's readily available right then

577
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,119
with adding dry or men dry organic

578
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,038
amendments it takes a while the biology

579
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,079
actually has to break a lot of it down

580
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,000
it's not soluble like the percentage on

581
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,480
some of these products are like two to

582
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,960
three percent soluble

583
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880
the other 90 some percent is insoluble

584
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
it has to be broken down

585
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,480
and so

586
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,519
if i'm taking a tablespoon per gallon

587
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,519
which is five milliliters

588
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,279
you know for bottle

589
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,918
it's still pretty much the same ratio

590
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,440
it's just in a dry form

591
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,440
i'm gonna have to try to figure out how

592
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,798
to make it spread evenly

593
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,200
where it you know when you mix

594
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,879
fertilizer up in water it it kind of you

595
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,038
can mix it a little bit evenly through

596
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
the water but not the soil you know

597
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,400
compared to dry amendment so

598
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,640
that's the application to me would be

599
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,280
pretty spot on

600
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,280
sometimes

601
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:46,000
depending on the nitrogen source

602
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,359
i think it could be a little high

603
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,119
uh i think

604
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,000
blood meal

605
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,479
uh if you're adding that to with other

606
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,839
nitrogen sources you might back off just

607
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,919
a little bit

608
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,240
i think you can create a toxicity to it

609
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,360
especially if you're say using like neem

610
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,400
seed meal and

611
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,479
kelp and oyster shell you know other

612
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,080
things that are higher in nitrogen

613
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,640
then you're to me you're going to really

614
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,158
create a toxicity because your nitrogen

615
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,159
levels are high

616
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,240
even though they're in different

617
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,400
amendment sources it's still going to be

618
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,319
high so yeah

619
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,038
when it when you're adding several

620
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,759
different sources of nitrogen yes i

621
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,359
would consider backing off as well okay

622
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,200
and then one last thing on crab meal you

623
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,079
mentioned earlier

624
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
defense it helps with defense mechanism

625
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,519
i think you said it like that right

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,960
yep so

627
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,720
my question regards to that would be i

628
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,798
think a lot of people's ears perk up

629
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,960
because one of the things with that

630
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:50,079
plants produce as a defense mechanism is

631
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,319
trichomes so does crab meal you know

632
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,879
this may be a dumb question but uh

633
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,558
does crab meal help with trichome

634
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
production in that sense

635
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,440
so

636
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,480
what the plant does is trichomes are

637
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,440
like part of the secondary metabolite

638
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
issue

639
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,120
uh your salicylic your jasmonic

640
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,400
pathways are some of the stressor

641
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,359
pathways that when the plants being

642
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
attacked by a pathogen kind of triggers

643
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,959
these pathways

644
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,759
well these pathways are kind of also

645
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,759
releasing these

646
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,880
smells

647
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,959
like terpenoids flavonoids um

648
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
that actually will help protect it

649
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,919
either

650
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,319
causing the plant to be more stressed

651
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
out causing it so see trichomes are

652
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,200
resinous so as like a plant a bug walks

653
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,120
on it it will start to stick to it and

654
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
kind of trap itself

655
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,479
it's really if the plant's sick

656
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,319
it's going to be attacked anyhow

657
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,079
when the plant's stressed that's when

658
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,798
it's producing the trichomes the

659
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,759
secondary metabolites that's when it's

660
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,240
really

661
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,119
they're talking it's more active and why

662
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,200
it produces more trichomes so when you

663
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,719
create stressors

664
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
over watering underwatering

665
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
changing your temperatures i mean low

666
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,480
environmental stressors can help with

667
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,519
production of trichomes

668
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,519
and crabmeal

669
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,200
it has chitin

670
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:26,158
and so that itself helps with

671
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,278
those metabolites and helps to build

672
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,760
kind of those

673
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,839
trichomes the secondary the stressors

674
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,720
that the plants looking for to do that

675
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,599
gotcha next on the list is crustacean

676
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
meal

677
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,759
wanna talk to us about that yeah that's

678
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,439
gonna be similar to crab just a little

679
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,879
different type of

680
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
crustacean

681
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,559
sea animal

682
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
it's gonna have a little bit of nitrogen

683
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,000
to it a little

684
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,278
uh

685
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,319
like

686
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,200
minor

687
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,439
micro macro type nutrients to some of it

688
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,120
but it's still going to have chitinates

689
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,519
the same thing as crab and kind of

690
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,239
insect frass it's going to help with the

691
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,639
secondary metabolites in the plant

692
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,558
so using that to help

693
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,480
in the soil pre

694
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,798
and i don't believe in top dressing in

695
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,400
some of these i think they take way too

696
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,000
long to top dress

697
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
um

698
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,798
i believe if you're going to do it you

699
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,798
maybe scratch it in or kind of try to

700
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,798
blend it in a little bit in the top part

701
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,480
so the biology really gets all over to

702
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:27,839
help break it down sooner

703
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
uh

704
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,399
but adding it to like a tea or something

705
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,359
there's not a lot of solubility to it so

706
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,000
it's it's not worth it so if you really

707
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,879
you are utilizing crab crustacean meal

708
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,679
even oyster shell i recommend doing it

709
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,960
in the soil like a super soil mix i

710
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
think it'd probably be beneficial for

711
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,919
those folks that are reusing soil over

712
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,278
and over again right even though it

713
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
doesn't break down on the current growth

714
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,599
cycle well next growth cycle it's still

715
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,200
in there it's still breaking down it can

716
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,399
be beneficial so i think some of these

717
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
things that you mentioned that take a

718
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,000
long time to break down

719
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,079
well if you're reusing your soil over

720
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,599
and over again then it's certainly a

721
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:08,240
benefit to to use these longer breakdown

722
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,480
ones soil conditioning and that's what

723
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,960
it's doing helping condition the soil

724
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,679
helping the biology it's giving them a

725
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
surface area to kind of live off of as

726
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,038
they're breaking it down building the

727
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,519
colonies

728
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,038
so it does quite a bit it's it's

729
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,798
beneficial

730
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,278
that's one thing that i really enjoy

731
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,158
about using like crab meal crustacean

732
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,159
mill

733
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,799
there was actually a question in the

734
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,120
comment section on the last video we did

735
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,440
and i want to bring it up to you here

736
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,000
the question is do plants benefit much

737
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
from the added fatty acids in crustacean

738
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
meal

739
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,798
so this is what i

740
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,398
i'm understanding is that's a yes and

741
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,278
the reason being is because plants

742
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:54,398
produce fat lipids

743
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,798
biologies bacteria they like to break

744
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:00,479
down fats

745
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:03,839
doing your compost if you're adding such

746
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,319
things as avocado

747
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,278
that's fat

748
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,519
they love the fats i mean

749
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,000
you got to understand like you can't

750
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,798
just don't grease fat from your some of

751
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,519
your animals you're cooking i'm sure it

752
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,079
could be beneficial in small doses you

753
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:25,359
know they might enjoy it but

754
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:28,319
foods that are kind of naturally fatty

755
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:32,319
oh yeah the biology really go crazy

756
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:35,759
i try to give my plants dairy cream or

757
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,278
do it in my compost which is a fat

758
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,079
the whole milk

759
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,880
there's a lot of fat content to it

760
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,119
but it's also the lactose the sugars

761
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,360
that's with it that they enjoy

762
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,199
so there's two benefits to it

763
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,359
okay that's good to know moving right

764
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,798
down the list here uh there in

765
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,199
alphabetical order for those of you who

766
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,720
haven't caught on just yet feather meal

767
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,399
how about that talk to us about feather

768
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,319
meal feather mail

769
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,798
is awesome for

770
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,759
long term use

771
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,839
if

772
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,599
you're trying to build a soil

773
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,480
that's going to go

774
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,038
five six seven months

775
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,240
adding something like feather meal to it

776
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,558
will help it's a slow releasing nitrogen

777
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,640
and so it's going to take its time

778
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,000
breaking down and making it available

779
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
for your plant

780
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,519
and so it's going to go longer in your

781
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:30,079
soil than most your blood meals or

782
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,440
knee mills other sources of nitrogen

783
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,278
it's gonna

784
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,200
it's gonna be there a little longer

785
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,240
biology love it it really helps

786
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,240
condition the soil

787
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,159
that would be

788
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,960
so

789
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,080
i would mainly try to focus it

790
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,240
to

791
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,480
not work so much during the veg state

792
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,720
but as i'm getting into flour and laid

793
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
in the flour that's what i'm hoping that

794
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
the feather meal is going to last that

795
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,880
long because i like

796
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
to do bigger pots

797
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,278
get a bigger root base so my plants can

798
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,720
veg a little longer before i start

799
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,880
fruiting them

800
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,679
because i want the bigger the root the

801
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,039
bigger the fruit right if i can get

802
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,120
a basket of tomatoes versus just a

803
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,158
handful i think i'm going to take the

804
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,038
basket

805
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,200
so

806
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,240
if i let my plants veg a little longer

807
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
so they get a little bit bigger

808
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,278
then as they move in the flour that's

809
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,599
what i'm hoping that feather meal it

810
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,079
lasts to i get in the flour because my

811
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,359
plants still need nitrogen there's your

812
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,599
flowers your

813
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,959
produce it still needs nitrogen to

814
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,879
produce

815
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,558
and do the cell division and everything

816
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,600
else that it needs to do

817
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,359
i think that's one of the common

818
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,678
misconceptions out there is that uh

819
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,000
plants don't need nitrogen and flowering

820
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,840
you hear about oh it's heavy in nitrogen

821
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,759
for the veg stage but when the flower

822
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,079
stage you don't need it that's

823
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,960
completely false right i mean they need

824
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,119
some form of nitrogen they may need more

825
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,960
potassium and phosphorus in flowering

826
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,199
but they also still need nitrogen it's

827
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,880
not like nitrogen just completely falls

828
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,600
off the map on that one they still

829
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
uptake nitrogen believe it or not even

830
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,798
into late flower

831
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,239
plants are still looking for it

832
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,798
absolutely

833
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,880
how about fish hydrolysate so fish

834
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,480
hydrolysate

835
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,679
it's kind of like

836
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,159
it's a processed

837
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,559
hydrolysate which means it's

838
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,559
almost like a fat

839
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,759
most hydrolysates are a type of like a

840
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:32,000
fatty acid in a sense um

841
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
and the way the amino acids and the kind

842
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
of like the fatty acids are processed

843
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,200
down

844
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,640
um

845
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,120
and made

846
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,600
into these hydrolysates that are made

847
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,839
like kind of plant available

848
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,000
they have like

849
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,119
different proteins amino acids peptides

850
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
to them

851
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,639
um

852
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,679
but it's it's a process that

853
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,278
uh

854
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,559
done to the fish

855
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,720
to get them to be easily uptaken for

856
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,798
plants

857
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,440
they're good but they can be a negative

858
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,240
at the same time

859
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,880
you can overdo the hydrolysate versus

860
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,159
some of the meal

861
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,399
so i i would use a little less i do like

862
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,760
to use it more in a tea

863
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,000
versus

864
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:24,000
like a top dress or amendment

865
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,919
where the hydrolysate is more soluble

866
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,079
it breaks down a lot faster adding it to

867
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,880
water it's like once you add it to water

868
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,038
it kind of like disintegrates and it's

869
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,480
readily available

870
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,798
and so

871
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,720
that's where it's great to for a quick

872
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:42,158
feed in your plants because it's great

873
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,159
for nitrogen source amino acids uh but

874
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,399
if you go back to like some of the fish

875
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,399
meal it's slower it doesn't break down

876
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,319
the same way the biology has to kind of

877
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,079
break it down over time

878
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,119
so there's a little difference in the

879
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,678
hydrolysate versus meals especially when

880
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,558
it comes to that you also mentioned fish

881
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,480
meal along with that fish hydrolysate

882
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,240
would you say these are pretty

883
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,319
pretty similar in the sense as what like

884
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,960
the npk is

885
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,759
they're just kind of different forms

886
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,640
or what um

887
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,759
yes

888
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,000
so

889
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,398
they have a nitrogen they have some

890
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,200
phosphorus some potassium but they have

891
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,199
more like the amino acid complex

892
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,480
okay so it's a different form of

893
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
nitrogen

894
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,839
more in an amino acid form than it is

895
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,759
like a nitrite or nitrate that's my

896
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,199
understanding of it okay and then so for

897
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,158
fish meal

898
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,960
when would you typically apply that uh

899
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,039
well fish mill kind of works through

900
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,840
a lot of the veg state

901
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,599
um

902
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,000
you're looking to build that soil you're

903
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,480
looking to build the biology you want to

904
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,200
take up the nitrogen

905
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,200
but as you're getting into

906
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,880
flour that's when i'd kind of start

907
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,600
cutting back i don't need all those

908
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,159
amino acids i'm already having some

909
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,319
stuff that has nitrogen that's releasing

910
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,960
i don't need to add more to it if i'm

911
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,278
trying to help with the biology i might

912
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
add a little bit but i'm not gonna add a

913
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,039
lot

914
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,078
okay that's good to know moving on to

915
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:16,398
insect frass so this is something that i

916
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,280
use i know there are a couple types of

917
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,719
insect frass the one i use is uh black

918
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,320
black soldier

919
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,000
insect frass

920
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,838
and i know one of the most important

921
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,599
things on this is chitin is what it's

922
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,358
known for can you talk to us about

923
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,919
insect frass what is it one of the

924
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,358
benefits and how you apply it so this is

925
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,000
something i've talked about for many

926
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,480
years since insect frass came out with

927
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,239
their insect frost

928
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,358
i always kind of followed subcool's

929
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,118
recipe on this super soil and then i

930
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,759
really started learning about amendments

931
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,440
and learned insect fast

932
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,000
insect frass

933
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,039
is great it most of them are either like

934
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,039
a three one two or two two two when it

935
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,440
comes to mpk

936
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,679
but most of it's frass

937
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,559
poop

938
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,358
another name is guano

939
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,719
so

940
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,000
that's where

941
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,279
plant bugs eat plants and so their frass

942
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,519
is not

943
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,040
it's more

944
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:19,199
omnivore not herbivore it's plant-based

945
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,358
where you're eating

946
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,799
uh all this plant tissue you're eating

947
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,639
cytokine

948
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,760
so that's where the scidic in their

949
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,639
shells like the the exoskeletons

950
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,960
are the cytokines for these bugs so when

951
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,879
they're dying off their shells

952
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,320
are part of the frass as well

953
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,079
and that's where some of the cytokine

954
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,599
comes in

955
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
cytokin

956
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,880
so

957
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,480
insect frass has a couple different

958
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,599
brands

959
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,679
black soldier flies

960
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,720
you have

961
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,639
different

962
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,838
type of mealybugs or different type of

963
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,279
bugs

964
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,440
that they use to kind of harvest the

965
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,400
frass but frass

966
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,519
is great

967
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
for

968
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,000
protozoa as well

969
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,760
so when people do

970
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,480
soil biology

971
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,640
they talk a lot about bacteria and fungi

972
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,800
they forget about needing protozoa

973
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,559
helps eat the bacteria and fungi to

974
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,560
release the nutrients that they're

975
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,239
storing in their bodies

976
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,320
insect fracks is one of those things

977
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,159
that actually has protozoa to it like

978
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,400
alfalfa meal

979
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,598
it's kind of in the plant tissue

980
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,280
it it seems to work its way where

981
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,359
it's part of this

982
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,720
byproduct that when it's in the water

983
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,400
they kind of start hatching and

984
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,919
releasing like they go in a dormant

985
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,480
stage and just

986
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,880
kind of wait to be hatched in a sense

987
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,240
uh but insect frass has always been a

988
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,200
great amendment

989
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:49,199
uh for the cytokin for what it brings

990
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,118
for the biology because it also brings

991
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,078
that bacteria fungi and different

992
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,519
strains of it to the soil and that's

993
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,160
what you're looking for is a little bit

994
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,838
of diversity in soil biology

995
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,319
so insect frass

996
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,239
is to me one of the better amendments

997
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
that if you're looking to add just a

998
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,959
couple

999
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,598
that would be one of them i would be

1000
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,720
wanting to add the cytokine alone that

1001
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,280
you get

1002
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,519
just from the frass helps with that

1003
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,040
trichome development

1004
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:22,719
that secondary metabolism and the plant

1005
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:25,838
to fight off pets and pathogens

1006
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,598
so it's that beneficial

1007
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,719
it to me it's more beneficial than crab

1008
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,160
meal

1009
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,159
crustacean meal

1010
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,838
a character from wrong but

1011
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,838
there's something in it that helps with

1012
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,320
resistance to pottery mildew as well

1013
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,480
it's a chitin that's the chitinase

1014
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,519
that's the different strains that are in

1015
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
it

1016
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,719
of bacteria

1017
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,480
that you can do a foliar application

1018
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,598
that's supposed to help

1019
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,599
fight off the omyces the molds

1020
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,519
mildews

1021
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,119
so definitely super beneficial

1022
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,320
especially for those of you who are out

1023
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,320
there that

1024
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,519
fight pottery mildew right i have issues

1025
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
with that

1026
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,039
this can be something that you add in as

1027
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,319
an amendment and could help fight off it

1028
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,920
so yeah to me like when we were talking

1029
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,119
about how

1030
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,320
the crab meal the crustacean

1031
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,760
have nitrogen ratios well so does insect

1032
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,000
frost

1033
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,119
those others don't have protozoa to them

1034
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,599
protozoa is one of the parts of the soil

1035
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,320
food web that you need to have

1036
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,160
when you're doing gardening outdoors

1037
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,800
indoor cultivation and you're trying to

1038
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,799
mimic mother nature it's like

1039
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,480
bacteria fungi protozoa

1040
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,800
and on down

1041
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,679
that's the third one in the chart

1042
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,800
that's what helps eat the other two

1043
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,559
if you don't have protozoa or the other

1044
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,480
biology that help eat the bacteria and

1045
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,400
fungi your nutrients are being locked up

1046
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,119
and stored up they're not being helpful

1047
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,960
to the the plant

1048
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,400
so that's why to me it's one of the most

1049
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,920
beneficials

1050
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
of

1051
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,559
the crab crustacean insect frass even i

1052
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:11,519
i'd rather use that over the guanos

1053
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,599
and that's what i do i use both

1054
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,280
types of insect press

1055
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
and i think there's a lot of people like

1056
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,400
oh well i use microbial inoculants i

1057
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,240
don't think there's a whole lot of

1058
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,480
microbinoculants that have protozoa in

1059
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,838
it right i think it's mostly there is

1060
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,240
not right

1061
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,400
that is correct yes

1062
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
there is a show that we were watching

1063
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,760
the other day talking about the same

1064
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,280
problem

1065
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
what is one of the things missing in

1066
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,920
most people's soil protozoa

1067
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,000
well protozoa is really key and there's

1068
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,559
not a lot of products out there on the

1069
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,960
market that you can buy

1070
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,039
that are going to retain

1071
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,880
the protozoa in it

1072
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,039
like if you did a bottle of nutrient

1073
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,320
they have it has a shelf life protozoa

1074
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,480
is only going to live in there so long

1075
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,480
before they start dying off because

1076
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,719
they didn't hibernate they thought they

1077
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,960
were being active

1078
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,919
kind of that suspended animation type

1079
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
deal

1080
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,480
once they you know kind of hibernate

1081
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,000
then they get rehydrated reanimate come

1082
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,159
back a life and

1083
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,079
do their job but some of those microbes

1084
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,480
are dying off right once they go dormant

1085
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,119
they die off they don't fully die off

1086
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,880
but a lot of them it dies back they kind

1087
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,079
of hibernate a lot of them really

1088
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,838
hibernate

1089
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,960
and they found that

1090
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,358
it it takes either high temperatures or

1091
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
like a major disturbance to kill off

1092
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,239
most of the biology

1093
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,559
but for a drought to happen it happens

1094
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,919
naturally most of them don't all die off

1095
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,759
they kind of hibernate until the

1096
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,599
conditions are right before they come

1097
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,599
alive again same thing with

1098
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:48,719
salmonella e coli they're around you

1099
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,039
every day

1100
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,519
it just everything is keeping them at

1101
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,599
bay until something causes them to get

1102
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,199
out of hand and out of control and then

1103
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,359
that's when they become deadly

1104
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,118
fascinating i didn't know that you would

1105
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,440
be really surprised that's why a lot of

1106
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,318
people become

1107
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,639
in fear of bacteria always washing and

1108
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,199
cleaning and that phobia

1109
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,118
that's one of the that's why they're oh

1110
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,679
my god it's really all around me it

1111
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,720
could kill me at any time

1112
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:22,239
it's it's sad but it's not as deadly as

1113
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:25,199
they make it out to be okay good to know

1114
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,598
moving on to kelp meal talk to us about

1115
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,559
kelp meal kel mill

1116
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,318
is

1117
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,960
very beneficial

1118
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:32,960
it has

1119
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,399
up to 70 micro macro nutrients

1120
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
it has different

1121
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,039
plant growth regulator plant growth

1122
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,519
hormones pgrs

1123
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,119
such as cytokines and oxins

1124
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,880
also has some gibberellin in it so

1125
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,400
this is one of them that people really

1126
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,880
like to push

1127
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,880
but you have to watch out kelp can have

1128
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,880
some heavy metals

1129
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,480
same thing with alfalfa or some of these

1130
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,079
other amendments but

1131
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,240
there's ways around that and we can talk

1132
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,318
about that another time

1133
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,719
but kelp

1134
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,519
it's just an all-around

1135
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,039
one of the better products really for

1136
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:17,559
the overall

1137
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,559
nutrient availability it provides

1138
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,439
it provides more than two-thirds of

1139
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,039
these products together with the amount

1140
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,519
of micro macro nutrients the npk to it

1141
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,400
like that's why a lot of people

1142
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,800
down the earth most of their bio lines

1143
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,639
have kelp to them

1144
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,800
because they really consider that

1145
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,759
beneficial to their product

1146
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,760
that it has so much nutrient to it

1147
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,480
and its nutrient density

1148
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,680
that

1149
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,679
that's why they really look to use in it

1150
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,279
there's not many other

1151
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,159
amendments that have

1152
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,240
70 micro macronutrients

1153
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,838
and that's the one thing i preach a lot

1154
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,318
on my channel is micromacronutrients are

1155
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,400
very important because without this we

1156
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,920
don't have certain balances happening

1157
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,358
within the plant

1158
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,280
they can't stay in a homeostasis

1159
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:12,880
if they're low on something it's going

1160
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
to cause them to start reacting

1161
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
differently

1162
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
and

1163
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,838
plants need heavy metals

1164
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,599
despite what we think they need some

1165
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,279
lead they need some arsenic they need

1166
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,119
boron but very very trace minutes amount

1167
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,880
like

1168
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,720
just you know you a droplet's too much

1169
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,960
if you went like a tenth 100th of that

1170
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,239
maybe

1171
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,039
but that's

1172
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,239
that's why kelp is so important is

1173
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,800
because it has a lot of this

1174
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,799
what the plant needs in it as humans we

1175
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,359
need the same thing we need a lot of

1176
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,318
these trace elements

1177
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,480
we don't get them in our diet

1178
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,159
the soil doesn't have it these bottled

1179
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,318
nutrients they don't have a lot of these

1180
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,480
trace elements

1181
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,519
that's why we

1182
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,960
find that

1183
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,199
using

1184
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,039
amendments that have higher amounts of

1185
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,799
trace elements

1186
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,920
produce a better

1187
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,680
profile with the plant terpene profile

1188
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,599
they're healthier because they're

1189
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,679
getting the full

1190
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,440
spectrum of elements that they need here

1191
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,960
but a lot of people talking about super

1192
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
foods to eat

1193
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,318
would we consider this a super amendment

1194
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,079
for your plants

1195
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,239
in a sense yeah

1196
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,560
it would be something it would be almost

1197
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,439
like a super amendment it's one of those

1198
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,159
that

1199
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,519
i would put a top of my list above most

1200
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:40,399
of these other other amendments

1201
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,000
it's not the end-all be-all i would take

1202
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,760
a few other amendments over it but

1203
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,079
that's me

1204
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,079
but this is one of them that

1205
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,359
if you're not using something like

1206
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,680
azomite

1207
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,239
to get the rock dust the like you know

1208
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:57,679
the trace minerals from the rock dust

1209
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,479
this this works great it helps to get

1210
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,480
those

1211
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,480
tray smell elements in there that you're

1212
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,719
not getting from the rock dust

1213
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,800
we talked about azomite in the previous

1214
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,799
episode we did together so once again

1215
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,318
that is linked down in the description

1216
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,039
section below for you guys to tune into

1217
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,199
that

1218
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,759
let's go over one more and then we will

1219
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,679
wrap things up how about neem seed meal

1220
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,599
can you talk to us about that yeah so

1221
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:20,719
neem seed meal

1222
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,240
it's

1223
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,719
it's a great product

1224
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,919
a lot of people over concerned about

1225
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:32,000
something called asteractin

1226
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,440
as directin is toxic to bugs

1227
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,880
not humans it can be if taken in high

1228
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,920
doses

1229
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,400
but

1230
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,760
azeractin is

1231
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,160
part of

1232
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,040
it's how do i want to describe it it's

1233
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,679
extracted so the neemc mill

1234
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,759
is a by-process of different extractions

1235
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,279
methods pulling

1236
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,280
some of the oils out of the neem

1237
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,880
they use either alcohol or water but

1238
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,960
names made into so many products

1239
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,079
from toothpaste to different

1240
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,079
vitamins that we can take as humans

1241
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,760
people in different countries actually

1242
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,079
eat some of the neem themselves to help

1243
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,839
so it's not bad as people make it out to

1244
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,880
be

1245
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,358
neem

1246
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,920
seed meal also helps

1247
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,039
with bad pathogens and pests that are in

1248
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,838
the soil

1249
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,440
they keep away bad

1250
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:30,880
nematodes so if you have root feeding

1251
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,358
nematodes

1252
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,400
neem seed will help prevent and keep

1253
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:38,400
some of them away from your plants

1254
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,039
neem seed milk is also great when it

1255
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,358
comes to me a terpene production

1256
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,000
something about the neem seed

1257
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,400
and i not sure or heard a lot of people

1258
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,679
talk about it but i know when i add a

1259
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,160
higher

1260
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,559
concentration of it to my soil

1261
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,679
the smell and the aroma i'm getting from

1262
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,920
my plant like it really helps with the

1263
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,759
flavonoid or the terpene production in

1264
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,720
those plants

1265
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,079
yeah i know there is a lot of

1266
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,679
controversy behind neem in general and

1267
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,599
uh i think you hit the nail on the head

1268
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,759
there with the acid reactant

1269
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,160
is what a lot of people are really

1270
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,240
complaining about and like you mentioned

1271
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,598
it is commonly used in so many different

1272
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,838
products

1273
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,160
and so um well

1274
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,880
their concern is hey you're spraying

1275
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,639
your plants with neem oil

1276
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,400
right because you're trying to use it as

1277
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,480
a ipm

1278
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,720
well oh it's systemic it goes into your

1279
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,400
plant it's not systemic

1280
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,318
it does not go into the plant cell

1281
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,119
tissue and stay there

1282
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,119
that's not true

1283
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,920
what it does is it kind of biodegrades

1284
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,519
over time it's just an oil just like

1285
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,440
everything else but they're concerned

1286
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,960
that it's leaving as direct and as a

1287
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,679
residue

1288
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,000
well first of all are you spraying it on

1289
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,000
your plants

1290
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,920
when they're fruiting or in flour

1291
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,599
because most of the time we tell you not

1292
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,358
to do it then

1293
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,920
you don't want to spray your fruits and

1294
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:07,759
your your flowers your herbs if you're

1295
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,800
going to be using them to consume

1296
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,960
so

1297
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,480
you're not going to have a concern of

1298
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,920
any as

1299
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,199
direct in

1300
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,800
residue

1301
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,879
but first of all if you actually read

1302
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
the label in contents it says there

1303
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,358
should be none in it

1304
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,079
should be all extracted out

1305
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,358
and the might new traces that are left

1306
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,240
in it

1307
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,639
it even will tell you that they will

1308
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:37,118
cause harm to bugs

1309
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:38,558
not earthworms not bigger like birds or

1310
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,720
other rodents

1311
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,960
insects because of what it does to their

1312
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,279
reproductive organs what it does to the

1313
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,240
extosin

1314
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,280
that's

1315
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,959
the harm it doesn't do it to us though

1316
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,920
yes people i've talked about oh well

1317
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,838
there's deaths in these other countries

1318
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,200
if you read what happened that said they

1319
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,639
too consumed a large amount

1320
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,439
more than they should have and that's

1321
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,159
what

1322
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,400
ended up killing them and it wasn't

1323
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,318
just hey they took the recommended

1324
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,440
dosage no they took more than what was

1325
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,239
recommended didn't kill them

1326
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,159
so

1327
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:18,719
when people talk about a concern of

1328
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:21,279
asteractin it's not a concern

1329
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,719
you're not putting high doses of neem

1330
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,960
seed meal

1331
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,639
for your plants to even uptake it you're

1332
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,639
not spraying a lot of neem on your

1333
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:32,400
plants for it to be a concern so okay

1334
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,719
that's good to know

1335
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,358
so i asked you this question at the end

1336
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,399
of the last episode that we did together

1337
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:42,480
i really want to ask it again because we

1338
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,440
have a lot of new folks that are joining

1339
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,000
i mean

1340
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,280
we filmed that episode a year ago and

1341
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,199
between

1342
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,640
now and then

1343
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,159
there's been a countless number of

1344
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,400
people who have just started gardening

1345
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,639
for the first time so for those folks

1346
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,318
that are pretty new maybe starting to

1347
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,679
use some of these organic inputs these

1348
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,480
organic amendments

1349
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,078
what advice do you have for them well

1350
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,599
some of it's going to depend on if

1351
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,079
you're indoor or outdoor cultivating

1352
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,079
outdoor

1353
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,400
you're going directly in the soil so

1354
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,318
you're

1355
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,160
you can have problems with pathogens

1356
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,400
right away

1357
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,239
indoor you're you're you're getting a

1358
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,000
soil you're kind of creating it you're

1359
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,558
putting in different biology so you kind

1360
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,318
of understand what's in there

1361
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,240
so

1362
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,239
if i'm looking at amendments and i'm

1363
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,558
looking at both conditions if i'm doing

1364
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,919
a big garden and i'm trying to prepare

1365
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,480
it

1366
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,519
i'm going to put down

1367
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,838
something that has some micro

1368
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:45,838
macronutrients either like azomite

1369
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,119
or kelp

1370
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,078
kelp is going to give me some of the

1371
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,599
plant

1372
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,519
hormones that my

1373
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,359
my seedlings are looking for to get

1374
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,400
started growing

1375
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:59,358
and grow healthy start shooting out

1376
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,838
and up and root growth

1377
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:05,519
so kelp like we're talking is one of

1378
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:08,639
those super ones you would put up there

1379
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:11,679
i would look at insect frass and not

1380
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,598
over guano because the protozoa

1381
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,358
so you're getting the bacteria the fungi

1382
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,880
the protozoa you're getting chitinas

1383
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,960
you're getting stuff to kind of help the

1384
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,160
plants defend themselves

1385
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,199
building

1386
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:25,838
the soil diversity as well because

1387
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,759
it is about soil diversity the soil and

1388
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,960
the plant are one they communicate they

1389
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,880
talk

1390
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,800
the plant actually eats up the biology

1391
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,318
and spits it out that's a whole other

1392
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,400
talk

1393
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,719
and if you talk to dr james white he

1394
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,880
could go into that but

1395
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:44,000
so that would be two of them would be

1396
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,000
insect frass and the kelp meal you don't

1397
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,760
really need nitrogen some of these

1398
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,920
products have nitrogen so when people

1399
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,599
are like oh i need nitrogen you know i'm

1400
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,440
not so worried about nitrogen these

1401
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,680
products have it i don't need high

1402
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,159
amounts of nitrogen like i've been told

1403
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,480
for years by all these big ag companies

1404
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:03,279
so you need nitrogen nitrogen no no i

1405
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,838
don't i don't need as much i need it but

1406
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,160
i don't need high amounts of it alfalfa

1407
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,000
mill would be a good one

1408
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,358
neem seed mill would probably be another

1409
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,400
good one

1410
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,598
if i was looking to add a couple

1411
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
but

1412
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,160
i would find something that's

1413
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,920
not an all-in-one i don't believe in the

1414
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,279
all-in-ones

1415
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,039
because a lot of people

1416
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,119
like down earth has

1417
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,279
biolife which is like five products in

1418
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,440
one

1419
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,079
i don't quite believe in that i believe

1420
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,159
doing it yourself so you're getting more

1421
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,400
instead of us like

1422
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,838
i can discuss that later but

1423
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,358
humic acid

1424
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,199
that's another one

1425
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,440
that would be up there in my super ones

1426
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,118
because your plants are trying to create

1427
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,599
humus when they're breaking down this

1428
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:53,039
product and the humus is retaining all

1429
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,599
the nutrients all of your ion bonds

1430
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,679
cations for the plant to take up that's

1431
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,760
where it stores the energy that's where

1432
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,679
it stores everything is in the humus

1433
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,440
humic acid

1434
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,159
so i would look at that because it's

1435
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,000
very beneficial for soil biology as well

1436
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,838
lots of good information there

1437
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,760
so wrapping things up how can the

1438
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,159
listeners find you and what do you have

1439
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,280
upcoming in the future well uh you can

1440
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,318
find me on youtube and instagram both uh

1441
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,400
youtube

1442
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,279
just over 20 plus thousand followers so

1443
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,280
it's been growing uh we're trying to do

1444
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,359
some changes with the channel it's gonna

1445
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,559
take a few months um

1446
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,838
but i want to make it more about a brand

1447
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,839
and not about

1448
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:36,078
me as the person

1449
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,440
i want to get more content on there from

1450
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
other

1451
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,838
people in the industry kind of like what

1452
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,680
you've been doing

1453
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,639
um with some of your channels but i want

1454
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,719
to get

1455
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,598
more

1456
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:49,598
scientists

1457
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,720
people that are botanists

1458
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,599
people soil biologists people that

1459
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,279
are really in the science of everything

1460
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,838
because a lot of people that follow me

1461
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,599
we really try to turn you on to the

1462
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,838
science of things

1463
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,760
and give you just enough that you want

1464
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,000
to do the research yourself

1465
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,000
oh i heard him talk about this

1466
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,760
oh i heard so-and-so talk about oh well

1467
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,119
maybe we need to look it up and see what

1468
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,319
this is really about

1469
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,400
you know like

1470
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,800
that's my job is to try to turn people

1471
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,960
on to that information so

1472
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,640
i want to try to do more with it

1473
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,800
i want to try to do more with my youtube

1474
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,719
channel try to get more information out

1475
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,240
and not just through me

1476
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,719
i'll definitely be looking forward to

1477
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:33,919
that i've learned so much from you in

1478
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:37,598
regards to organic gardening and

1479
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,480
just the science behind the plant and uh

1480
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,559
i think it would be awesome to see you

1481
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,318
like interview or like have discussions

1482
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,519
with people who are on that level

1483
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,318
because i think you'd bring a ton of

1484
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,920
value you do such a good job of taking

1485
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,920
that information and

1486
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,240
putting it into a form that's digestible

1487
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,798
to somebody who's pretty new you know

1488
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,039
without and i tried to do that keeping

1489
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,480
it simple so it's easy to understand

1490
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,480
because there's a lot of big complex

1491
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,559
words and i'm like oh my god like how do

1492
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,679
you even say that

1493
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,559
you know and

1494
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,679
i know that even me being an educated

1495
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,240
man

1496
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,639
it's still easier for people to get it

1497
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,719
at the simplest form and move into

1498
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,639
something a little harder than trying to

1499
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,558
start off with harder information that

1500
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,078
they don't even understand

1501
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,400
yeah it can be confusing a lot of things

1502
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,359
can go over people's head for sure so

1503
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,798

you so much for coming on the podcast

1519
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,798
once again second time around uh i am

1520
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,079
happy might need a third one potentially

1521
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,960
right

1522
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,480
if i create controversy over like dr

1523
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,199
bruce bugsby

1524
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,400
uh comments i made we might be able to

1525
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:10,000
get the third one on here for sure

1526
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,240
yeah we could definitely go down that

1527
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,920
because i know you had uh quite a few

1528
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,558
things to say about that particular

1529
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,960
podcast that i did with him and uh yeah

1530
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,559
maybe that would be a good episode for

1531
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,639
the next time around it's kind of going

1532
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,720
over some of the things that you had

1533
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,879
thought that you didn't agree upon with

1534
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,558
him because there is uh i know you

1535
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,798
mentioned we won't get too deep into it

1536
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,720
we're closing things up here but uh

1537
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:35,280
you had pointed to some studies in

1538
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,239
regards to that that conflicts with some

1539
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,519
of the things they had mentioned so

1540
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,598
maybe we can go over that in the next

1541
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,440
episode yeah that might be pretty

1542
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,280
interesting for some of your

1543
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,039
viewers to really hear

1544
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,319
some of the information from another

1545
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:47,759
point

1546
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,519
absolutely

1547
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,440
