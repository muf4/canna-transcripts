33
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,880
[Music]

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
all right here we are in my two foot by

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,118
four foot grow tent this one is by ac

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,519
infinity you can see i got the lettuce

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,519
there got a couple freaks in the middle

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,640
and then there on the left side of the

39
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,319
grow tent i have four pepper plants so

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
these pepper plants are actually a

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,839
variety called bullnose peppers looks

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,239
very close to bell peppers but they're a

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
smaller version of them let's actually

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,839
start off talking about the bowl nose

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
peppers these ones are coming right

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,290
along definitely got some fruit forming

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
so far

48
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,159
[Music]

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,719
you can see right here i'm shaking them

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
this is in order to allow pollen to drop

51
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,200
down and pollinate the flowers the

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
flowers will then turn into peppers once

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
pollinated so you can see right here i'm

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
peeling off the flowers around the

55
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,679
pepper that's forming there i think in

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
the future i'm going to use a swab to

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
actually grab pollen from the flowers to

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,519
pollinate them i've had a couple flowers

59
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,000
that actually dropped off they weren't

60
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,318
pollinated doing the shake techniques so

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,719
hopefully that'll help pollinate more in

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,839
the future this plant has quite a few as

63
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,680
well

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
this one back here a little bit bigger

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
of peppers

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
i've got one two

67
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,598
and then there's a third one here as

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,598
well

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,719
fourth plant back here i've got quite a

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,599
few peppers on here these ones are

71
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,080
bigger as well than the front two ones

72
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,479
this is the biggest one of them all

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,719
this one i would say is pretty close to

74
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,039
harvest i'd love to know when you guys

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,560
determine when to harvest peppers let me

76
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,639
know down in the comments section below

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
i mentioned on my last video that pretty

78
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,759
new to peppers this is my first round

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,680
growing peppers definitely going to

80
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,679
continue to grow them out in the future

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
i love hearing feedback i love to hear

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
what you do in your garden that helps

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
you and makes you successful growing

84
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,000
them so maybe i could take some of those

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
best practices and implement in my

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,919
garden so yeah let me know what tips and

87
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,679
techniques you use on when do harvest

88
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,598
these plants are grown in one gallon

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
containers so a little smaller of a

90
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,598
container than some of you may like i

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
know in my last video there were several

92
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,799
folks that said that i should

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,479
potentially grow in larger containers

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
whether they be three gallon containers

95
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,639
or five gallon containers but a little

96
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,000
bit bigger of containers some have said

97
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,839
that i would have gotten a little bit

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
better of a result however i see lots of

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
folks growing in these smaller

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,039
containers one gallon containers so i

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
know it is possible i do have a little

102
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,439
bit of space constraints so that's why i

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,120
chose to go with one gallon containers

104
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,959
this round but hey maybe next round i'll

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
go with a bit larger of containers i'm

106
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
gonna have a separate video with an

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,719
update on these two freaks this video is

108
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,639
just gonna be on the vegetables moving

109
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,799
on to the head of lettuce that i have

110
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,119
here this is actually the container that

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,360
i had the cut and come again i had half

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,039
of the container buttercrunch lettuce

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
and then the other half spinach the

114
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,000
spinach didn't do very well at all i

115
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,759
think it's because the hotter

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
temperatures that are on here they like

117
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,719
the cooler temperatures you know low 70s

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
even into the 60s or below that they can

119
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,400
survive in and some actually say the

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
lower the temps provide a better flavor

121
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
anyways talking about the lettuce here

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
buttercrunch it's actually about to bolt

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
so i am going to harvest this

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
turn this into a salad i think next time

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
around i'm going to grow probably two

126
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,159
maybe four

127
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,680
heads of lettuce in one seven gallon

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
container in the future i don't think

129
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,959
i'm gonna do the cut and come again

130
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,879
method again just because i don't eat

131
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,638
that much lettuce some of it went to

132
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,560
compost good amount of it actually went

133
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,478
to compost all of these plants were

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
grown with organic amendments i used

135
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,758
earth dust nutrients by the green

136
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,478
sunshine company this round and they're

137
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,319
all grown under the es 180 led grill

138
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,758
light also by the green sunshine company

139
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,199
i said in last video but i'll say it

140
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
again this light is a little bit of an

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,478
overkill for vegetables in my opinion

142
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,319
this light is more for medicinal

143
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,560
varieties i have this light actually dim

144
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,918
down i believe all the way to the lowest

145
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,918
setting because these vegetables they

146
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,918
don't need as much light as medicinal

147
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,198
varieties although the peppers actually

148
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,279
probably could take a good amount of

149
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,520
light but lettuce doesn't need that much

150
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,359
at all on the outro card here the video

151
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,879
on the left is the previous episode with

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
these vegetables that i spoke about and

153
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,159
the video on the right is automatically

154
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,319
generated by the youtube algorithm

155
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,320
thanks for watching until next time

156
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,319
peace
