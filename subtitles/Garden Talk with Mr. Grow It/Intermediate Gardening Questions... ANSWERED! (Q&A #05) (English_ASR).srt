1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,240
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
aka mr growit and i'm back with another

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,559
q a video

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,160
this time around i decided to do

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,919
intermediate questions

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
now some of you may see the questions

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,039
that are in this video and think to

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
yourself this is more of a beginner

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,240
question

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,518
trust me i do have beginner questions in

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,799
a separate category

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,639
these ones i felt like they're more

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
intermediate questions you might

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,960
disagree

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
that being said this will be the

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
intermediate questions q a

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,039
i'll have a beginner questions q a and

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,039
also an advanced

20
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,320
questions q a so if you have any

21
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,399
questions that you want me to

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
potentially answer in a future episode

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
please leave them down in the comment

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
section below i do get a ton of

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
questions in the comment section so

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
i certainly can't guarantee that i'm

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
gonna answer every question that's asked

28
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,279
before we get into the questions i just

29
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,360
want to give a quick shout out to our

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
sponsor for this episode

31
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,878
thanks to mars hydro for sponsoring this

32
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,558
episode they sent me over their

33
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:01,759
fc-4800 led grill light and this thing

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,518
looks pretty awesome

35
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:09,759
it has 2016 total diodes consisting of

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,478
samsung lm301b and osram 616 nanometer

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,159
diodes

38
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,679
and they're powered by an inventronix

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
driver it pulls

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,640
480 watts from the wall covers a 4 foot

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,118
by 4 foot grow space

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,239
and has an efficiency of 2.8 micromoles

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,159
per joule

44
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,759
it does have a dimmer on it so you can

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,719
adjust the power output

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,840
and it's daisy chainable up to 15 lights

47
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,920
i personally like the

48
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,920
bar style design which helps provide an

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
even light spread across the footprint

50
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,359
i will leave a link to mars hydro

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
website down in the description section

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,920

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
and you can also use coupon code mr

54

products

56
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
all right let's get into the video

57
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,719
getting close to harvest

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,239
should i do a 48 hour blackout before i

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,759
harvest for better results

60
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,599
or is it just a myth so i don't think

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,078
there's actually any scientific studies

62
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,718
on

63
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,078
the 48 hours of darkness before harvest

64
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,599
if there actually is a study out there

65
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,279
and somebody knows of it please leave it

66
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,879
down in the comments section below so i

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,478
can read into it but things that we do

68
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,319
know about this is

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,080
you know number one is that we know

70
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,560
secondary metabolites are

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
produced during lights-off periods so

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,039
secondary metabolites

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
that includes resin the trichomes that's

74
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,759
produced during

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
lights-off periods so that's the whole

76
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,439
thought process behind it is

77
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,640
give your plants 48 hours some people do

78
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,878
72 hours

79
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,079
of complete darkness that way the plant

80
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,598
can't produce those secondary

81
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
metabolites the extra

82
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,878
resin or trichome production and then

83
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,479
from there you would harvest

84
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,239
so as of right now i guess we can chalk

85
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,318
it up as bro science until

86
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
actual science comes out behind it now i

87
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,518
know there are some

88
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
youtubers out there that have done their

89
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
own individual studies

90
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
lost leaf i believe is one of them you

91
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,120
can search for his name

92
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,360
on youtube and he did a 48-hour darkness

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
study i believe he we actually took

94
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
tests

95
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,560
he did thc test results for a plant that

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,400
was

97
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
48 hours of darkness and one that was

98
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
not done with 48 hours of darkness and

99
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
he did see a slight difference there so

100
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,000
you may want to check that out to learn

101
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
more i'm sure that there's other

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
youtubers out there

103
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,479
other people who have done their own

104
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
individual studies

105
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,759
and reported their findings on whether

106
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
or not

107
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,878
48 hours of darkness worked for them or

108
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,799
not

109
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,000
my question is about organic amendment

110
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
fertilizers

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
i understand their instructions however

112
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
after using them

113
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
and doing a lot of research i found that

114
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,238
although the fertilizers sound great

115
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,158
it's hard to determine when the

116
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
nutrients will be plant ready

117
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,439
mineralized do you think going to a

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
single amendments

119
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,639
bone meal fish meal etc is better for my

120
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,518
conditions

121
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,318
than the premix versions bio live bloom

122
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
boost

123
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,759
and if so where's a good place i can

124
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,598
find recommendations you can certainly

125
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,959
do individual amendments instead of

126
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,479
doing the blends

127
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
the blends are just one way to go about

128
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,000
it the individual amendments are a

129
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,199
different way to go about it now if

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,438
you're going to go the individual

131
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,719
amendment route i highly recommend you

132
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,680
go buy

133
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,080
a soil mix or method that has been tried

134
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
and

135
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
works a great place where you can find

136
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
recommendations is build the soil

137
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
so buildthesoil.com they have a

138
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,798
resources

139
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,238
section in there i think they have three

140
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
different soil recipes

141
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,759
i know a ton of people that use those

142
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,878
recipes with success

143
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,199
if you really want to go buy the

144
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
individual amendments

145
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
maybe check out build a sole see if they

146
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,159
have certain ratios

147
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,000
that you need to go by because if your

148
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
ratios get out of whack

149
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
you may see deficiencies in the plants

150
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
some nutrients can lock out other

151
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
nutrients

152
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,000
so on and so forth something i seem to

153
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
always struggle with those calcium

154
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
deficiencies

155
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
in transition and flower can't seem to

156
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,319
ever get it 100

157
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
would enjoy if you touched on that

158
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,159
specifically so calcium deficiency is

159
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
one of the most common deficiencies

160
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,080
out there if you're growing in soil a

161
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120
lot of folks what they'll do is they'll

162
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,199
add in calmag

163
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,879
every time so they'll add it in along

164
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
with their base nutrients

165
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,159
when you're mixing with water calmed

166
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
first

167
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
then base nutrients and then on watering

168
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,918
days where you're supposed to feed water

169
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,159
only some people also do calmag on

170
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,680
those days as well so that might be what

171
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
you're missing is just not

172
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
feeding calmag in on watering days could

173
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
be causing a deficiency

174
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
if you're in coco coir most growers do

175
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,560
feed calmag

176
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,959
every single time as far as dosage 5

177
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
to 10 milliliters per gallon i believe

178
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,879
is what the back of most bottled say

179
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,638
you don't have to do a half dose at

180
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,399
least in my experience you don't really

181
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
have to do a half dose you can

182
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,000
do a full dose of calmag i know one of

183
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
the mistakes that a lot of beginners

184
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
make is they'll do

185
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,079
half the dose because they always hear

186
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
about half dose of nutrients

187
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,359
that's usually for base nutrients

188
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
additives such as calamag you can do a

189
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
full dose

190
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,319
one last thing if you're struggling with

191
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,679
calcium deficiency particularly also if

192
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,199
you're growing in soil

193
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,038
is staying above 6.2 ph

194
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,120
provides a little bit better of calcium

195
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,079
uptake can you reuse soil that has

196
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
bottled nutrients

197
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,399
if you really try to wash or flush it

198
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,519
out short answer is yes you can reuse

199
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,679
that soil

200
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,120
i've done it before where i've flushed

201
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,759
out the nutrients

202
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,840
in a previous soil that i had used

203
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
bottle nutrients on so i flushed it

204
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,599
reused that soil did come across some

205
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
deficiencies

206
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
i mean when you're doing that you're

207
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,199
risking your nutrient ratio kind of

208
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,560
being out of whack and some nutrients

209
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
getting locked out

210
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,839
because there's excess of other

211
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,758
nutrients now when i did actually reuse

212
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,079
soil that i had used bottled nutrients

213
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
in

214
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,478
on a previous grow i did actually take

215
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,439
that soil and send in a soil sample to

216
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,199
logan labs

217
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,800
and one thing i found on that soil

218
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,759
sample report was

219
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
it was high in sodium and i think that

220
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,479
was

221
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
probably one of the reasons why i was

222
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,758
seeing issues

223
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,439
so for me personally i really don't like

224
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,360
to reuse soil that i've used

225
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,800
synthetic nutrients in prior and i think

226
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
a lot of growers out there i feel like a

227
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
majority of the growers will actually

228
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,879
just

229
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,719
toss out that soil and start fresh just

230
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,879
because there is that risk

231
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
um you know it's definitely frustrating

232
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,360
when you're

233
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
trying to get through a grow and all of

234
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
a sudden you see deficiencies popped up

235
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,399
and all you have you're scrambling have

236
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
to flush the plant

237
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,560
and so on and so forth so it's just it

238
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
can be a little bit easier if you're

239
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,478
just using fresh soil each time

240
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
when using synthetic bottled nutrients

241
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
it's a waste but

242
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,000
it can be easier how can you tell if the

243
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,038
strain you're growing is legit strained

244
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,079
to be a mother plant

245
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,318
i think that really comes down to

246
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,758
personal preference you know if you're

247
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,439
growing out a plant and you get into the

248
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
flowering stage and you really like how

249
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,399
that plant

250
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
looks some of the characteristics that

251
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,279
you're looking for whether it be

252
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,439
you know frost production the colors

253
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,879
so on and so forth and you want to keep

254
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,800
that strain around you can actually

255
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,038
clone it in the flower stage

256
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,680
re-veg it that's called monster cropping

257
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,279
that can be done and that can be taken

258
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
and used as a mother plant a lot of

259
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,519
people instead of doing that they'll

260
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,879
actually cut clones while it's in the

261
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,240
vegetation stage still

262
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,680
and they'll keep those plants around

263
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,439
then when they get into flowering if

264
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,038
they like that plant they'll keep those

265
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,478
clones around

266
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,079
and continue to grow maybe they'll use

267
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,120
one of those as a mother plant or if

268
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,079
they don't like that plant that they're

269
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
flowering they'll just

270
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,120
dispose of those clones so some people

271
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
cut the clones

272
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,478
prior so they have them just in case

273
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
they want to keep them others will do

274
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,240
that monster cropping process

275
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,598
and bring it back but as far as how to

276
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
tell if your strain is

277
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,519
is good enough to be a mother plant any

278
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
photo period plant can be turned into a

279
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,598
mother plant

280
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,839
when you're talking about oil flower

281
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,399
plants those are on a limited life span

282
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,638
so

283
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,159
you definitely can't keep auto flower

284
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
plants as mother plants

285
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
how do you like earth dust products and

286
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
do you add anything else to it when

287
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,318
using it

288
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,720
so i actually struggled using earth dust

289
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160
at first however over the years

290
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
i've gotten the hang of it so i actually

291
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
do like using earthdust now

292
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,278
a couple tips i would start in larger

293
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,639
containers i was starting in like three

294
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,799
gallon containers

295
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,479
five gallon containers and sometimes

296
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,838
it's a struggle compared to if you're

297
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
using a larger container which

298
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,880
i'm using now i'm using a 7 gallon

299
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
container some people use

300
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,320
15 gallon containers or even larger than

301
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
that when they're

302
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
growing with organic nutrients or living

303
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
soil things i add with it

304
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,600
recharge is great mammoth p any microbes

305
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
are going to be good data in it

306
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
root magic by blue plant nutrients i

307
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,560
like to add into it

308
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,879
i also do teas teas more so in the

309
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,958
flowering stages when i'll add teas in

310
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,159
they're either just a nutrient tea or

311
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,799
with earth dust products you can

312
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,639
actually do

313
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
two tablespoons per plant which i think

314
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,120
is what dan from the green sunshine

315
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,039
company recommends

316
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,879
a worm castings you know high quality

317
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,240
worm castings those can be added

318
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,480
just about any point throughout the

319
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,000
grill or can be put into teas

320
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,000
and then i also like to use molasses as

321
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,200
well both as a soil drench

322
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,600
sometimes mostly in flowering stage

323
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,759
and also as a food source in my teeth is

324
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
it okay to use flavored epsom salts

325
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,879
than just plain epsom salt if you can't

326
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,040
find it epsom salt is magnesium sulfate

327
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,278
i highly recommend getting a epsom salt

328
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,120
that doesn't have any additives in it so

329
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,679
just look in the back of the directions

330
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
look for 100 magnesium sulfate i'm not

331
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,958
sure what additional additives are in

332
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
the epsom salt that you're looking at

333
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,518
but

334
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
it's probably not good in your garden

335
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,560
what do you think about growing at a low

336
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
20 to 30 rh during the flowering stage

337
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,799
will it make my buds more dense

338
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,559
so that's a really low humidity rh

339
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,240
stands for relative humidity for for

340
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,278
those that don't know that low humidity

341
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
goes against

342
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,519
vpd vapor pressure deficit some of you

343
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,399
may have heard of that not really know

344
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,879
what it is

345
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,559
with a low humidity like that vpd

346
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,240
actually increases

347
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,639
what's going to happen there is the

348
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,680
stomata on your plants leaves are going

349
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,559
to be smaller

350
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,639
as it gets smaller co2 uptake reduces

351
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,039
also as the vpd increases

352
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,559
transpiration increases as well as

353
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
transpiration increases

354
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,799
roots pull in more nutrients which could

355
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
actually lead to a toxicity issue so

356
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,479
for example if you have a lot of plant

357
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,078
available nitrogen in the medium

358
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
and your transpiration increases the

359
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,838
plants intaking more of that nitrogen

360
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,919
it could lead to a nitrogen toxicity

361
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
that's happened with me before it's

362
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,879
happened to a lot of

363
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,879
people that have posted on my forum

364
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,720
before it's somewhat common

365
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,919
for those that are running low humidity

366
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,759
like that so

367
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,838
overall running a lower humidity like

368
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,919
that the plant will still grow

369
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
it's just not ideal and it does cause

370
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,799
more stress on the plant to answer your

371
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,079
question on whether or not it makes the

372
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,679
buds more dense

373
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,679
in my experience it actually makes the

374
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,039
buds more airy that's just my experience

375
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,559
it might have just been the cultivars i

376
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,319
was growing but

377
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,078
yeah i usually have a better result as

378
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
far as bud structure when i'm in the

379
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,519
proper humidity range

380
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
after re-amending your used soil how

381
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
long does it need to cook before it's

382
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,399
ready to reuse

383
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,440
rule of thumb is two weeks some people

384
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,360
say three weeks

385
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,040
if you have a larger pile i was actually

386
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
talking to an outdoor grower quite

387
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,480
recently he says that for large piles

388
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
that he's growing outdoors

389
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,159
he actually weighed 16 to 90 days i

390
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
believe he said which is

391
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,838
very long but if you're a small indoor

392
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,079
grower two or three weeks

393
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,040
is general how many books do you have so

394
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,479
i'm not really sure if you're talking

395
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,240
about how many books i've written

396
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,079
or if you're talking about how many grow

397
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,278
books that i have i'll quickly show you

398
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,958
what books i have

399
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,838
so a lot of you have seen me mention

400
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,319
this one before this is jorge cevante's

401
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,920
growers bible i mean this was 2006 i

402
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,440
think is this edition so there are some

403
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,039
outdated things in here however there's

404
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
a whole bunch of good information

405
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,599
here so i do really enjoy this one true

406
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,319
living organics by the rev

407
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
this is my go-to for organic material

408
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
haven't gotten through this one entirely

409
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,078
skipped around it

410
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,760
quite a bit definitely need to sit

411
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,838
through and read this thing from cover

412
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,439
to cover still but uh yeah really good

413
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,839
stuff if you're going organically

414
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,160
ed rosenthal's handbook this is actually

415
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
used at oakster dam university

416
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,360
another one i've just kind of browsed

417
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,078
through i mean this is like a textbook

418
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,159
here

419
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,919
a ton of good information in this one ed

420
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,240

421
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,919

this 636 so six

425
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,000
almost 700 pages in this book this is by

426
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,919
greg green

427
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
and yes a whole wealth of information i

428
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,719
definitely haven't read this from cover

429
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
to cover yet but

430
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,879
uh maybe someday the emperor wears no

431
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,720
clothes by jack herrer

432
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,078
some people mispronounce his name jack

433
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,759
herrer it's

434
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,599
uh according to him it's jack hare

435
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,879
rhymes with terror this is the 14th

436
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,879
edition of this book i actually just got

437
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,360
this i haven't cracked into it yet

438
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,639
i've seen the previous edition and have

439
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
browsed through it a little bit

440
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
but yeah still need to read this one i

441
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,519
do have the beginner's guide

442
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,278
from danny danko this one is a pretty

443
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
good read a lot of general information

444
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,720
in here

445
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
i did read this from cover to cover

446
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,879
pretty enjoyable and then

447
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,360
my book right here a complete beginner's

448
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,439
guide for growing indoors

449
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,278
now just to talk a little bit more about

450
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
this this is really for the complete

451
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,000
beginners so i've had a couple people

452
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,320
buy this

453
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and they have you know two three years

454
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,480
of experience and like oh i knew

455
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
almost all this stuff so it's really

456
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
more geared towards if you're just

457
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
starting out your first or second grow

458
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
and you need kind of a walk through it's

459
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,278
a lot of general information

460
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,799
in order just to get you through that

461
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,879
grow there's a lot

462
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,039
more that can be said about the growing

463
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,879
process beyond this

464
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,639
but yeah complete beginners this is

465
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,039
available on amazon only i'll link it

466
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
down

467
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,159
in the description section below covers

468
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
both soil

469
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,600
and coco coir and if you do end up

470
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
buying it on amazon please

471
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,278
leave a review i would greatly

472
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,599
appreciate it trying to get up to 500

473
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,480
reviews i think i'm at like 220 reviews

474
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,159
so far

475
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,480
so i've got quite a ways to go almost

476
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,480
halfway there but uh if everybody out

477
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
there that had purchased the book

478
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
if you're able to leave a review on

479
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
amazon or rating i think a star rating

480
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
i would greatly appreciate it and i am

481
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,799
working on another book which i hope to

482
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
have

483
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,838
released by either late this year the

484
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
end of this year

485
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
or early next year it's probably more

486
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,799
early next year

487
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,799
but i've definitely been making a little

488
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,639
bit of progress on it so far and

489
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,958
books take a while especially the

490
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
research side of things and

491
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,518
you know having more hands-on

492
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
experiences some things i want to get

493
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,360
some hands-on experience

494
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,479
on and then write about so it's a

495
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
process but i'm

496
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
super excited about this one i think

497
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,078
it's gonna bring a lot of value i'm not

498
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,720
gonna reveal what it's about just yet

499
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,278
as time gets closer i i will giveaway

500
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
time

501
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,480
got another giveaway for you all and

502
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,399
