1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
i think the most important thing for

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,839
your root system to have to make your

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,800
plant grow vigorously is

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,200
you need oxygen and you need microbes

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,200
see

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,798
you want to form an even canopy if you

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,638
have a christmas tree you have

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,919
you know the lower bud sites that could

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,759
be getting the light they're not getting

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,839
the light they're being covered up so

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
they're gonna become airy like popcorn

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,839
buds as far as nutrients

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,358
i i do start off with the recharge you

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,960
know by real growers and

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,640
oh my god if anyone's been following the

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,039

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
exploded she's got a trunk almost like

19
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,640
my arm when you micromanage

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
you are gonna overwater because you feel

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,520
like you need to do something

22
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:46,799
and that's where people screw up

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600

was

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
um i thought it was gonna be like really

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
really tough you know what i'm saying

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,759
and um i remember before i actually got

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,959
into growing

94
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,719
i started to you know i started actually

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
started taking notes about like

96
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,199
everything like ever you know light

97
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,479

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
and um you know one thing led to another

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and

102
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,839
you know the thing about horticulture

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,598
that i learned is it's like you gotta

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
practice to get better like you can get

105
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,560
all the information you get but

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
like you can read every forum everything

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
out there but

108
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,878
if you don't you know i mean if you

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,158
don't practice if you don't practice

110
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,639
your craft you're never going to get

111
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,919
better

112
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,759
that's what i try to tell everybody you

113
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,598
know i mean yeah so many people that

114
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,560
just read books read forums and they

115
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,719
have knowledge

116
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
and you know they'll be on the forums

117
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,560
replying giving answers

118
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,318
yet they haven't grown the plant and

119
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,318
yeah right

120
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,158
it's sad that it's like that for some

121
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,199
things but yeah doing your research is

122
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,840
one thing

123
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,439
executing and getting the experience is

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
certainly another thing

125
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,400
absolutely so now you you're at the

126
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,878
point now where you have a youtube

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
channel

128
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,798
right um when did you launch the youtube

129
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,519
channel and what type of videos do you

130

131
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,439
youtube

171
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
like my tips from my grow vlogs

172
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,519
you know what i mean because youtube

173
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,879
doesn't like us very much so

174
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,879
you know they hate us they hate us

175
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,159
for those watching and not familiar with

176
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,839
420 scenes channel

177
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,680
i'll have that linked down in the

178
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,519
description section below

179
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,879
all right let's get into the topics

180
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,839
today so today we're going to talk about

181
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,120
autoflowers

182
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,239
and we'll also talk about compost teas

183
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
so let's start off by talking about

184
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,038
autoflowers what medium do you usually

185
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,280
grow

186
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,279
auto flowers in you know i was actually

187
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,839
experimenting with a lot of different

188
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,399
stuff

189
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,159
and um you know i'm a huge fox farm guy

190
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,198
everybody knows fox farm fox farm you

191
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
know what i mean

192
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,160
um what i like to do is because i do

193
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,680
transplant the autoflowers i know a lot

194
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
of people are weird about that

195
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,680
but uh um what i do is

196
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,279
i start them off in happy frog because

197
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
it's a it's pretty light soil it's kind

198
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,599
of like

199
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,080
fox farms light warrior you know and um

200
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
when i do transplant i like to have the

201
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,359
you know the bottom

202
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,719
like the bottom half portion of

203
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
strawberry fields

204
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
um you know with some perlite because

205
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,879
strawberry fields does not really

206
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
have the best drainage however it's i

207
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,639
mean

208
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,800
it's really good for flowering and um

209
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
that like the top layer of the soil i

210
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,879
have happy frog

211
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,038
and sometimes i'll mix in ocean forest

212
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,159
with happy frog you know because

213
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,918
ocean forest has you know like like bat

214
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,120
guano which is you know pretty important

215
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,159
for the veg stage

216
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,439
so like my logic behind that is okay you

217
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
know when i transplant they're gonna

218
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,399
have to go through the veg stage and and

219
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
all that but they're not going to be in

220
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,560
the vegetation for that long

221
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,478
because they are autoflowers so you know

222
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,079
by the time they start flowering

223
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,758
the roots will already hit the bottom

224
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,318
half which will be the strawberry fields

225
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
so

226
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
that's kind of my thinking behind it got

227
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,240
it and so do you start in like a solo

228
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,598
cup and then what container size do you

229
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,079
transplant into

230
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,279
i go from a solo cup to like a seven or

231
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,680
a ten gallon pot

232
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,038
okay and then are you using uh plastic

233
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
pots fabric pots

234
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,439
what do you want for what you know i

235
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,560
think they're they're great for aeration

236
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,399
you don't have to worry about

237
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,759
your plant getting root bound it's just

238
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,359
you know just kind of start kind of

239
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,800
spinning around you know

240
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
you cutting out a little bit did you say

241
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
smart pots yes smart pots

242
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,560
and then what do you use for nutrients

243
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,879
when you're feeding autoflowers

244
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,079
as far as nutrients i i do start off

245
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,680
with the recharge

246
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,439
you know by real growers and oh my god

247
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
if anyone's been following the you know

248
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,439
the skittles autoflower she like

249
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,520
exploded you know i mean like

250
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,439
she's got she's got a trunk almost like

251
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,000
my arm you know i mean it's

252
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,839
pretty crazy so i start off with a

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
recharge like during the veg stage

254
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,878
and um and then i give it some compost

255
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
tea

256
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
once in a while i'll throw in some some

257
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,759
of ilgm's flowering um

258
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
you know blood booster nutrients so um i

259
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,400
think it's got a 0

260
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,959
27 27 npk ratio so that's

261
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,519
excellent for flour you know got it so

262
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
do you use

263
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:15,439
fox farm trio as well or no no

264
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
i actually used to use the entire dirty

265
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,439
dozen and

266
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
and the trio no more

267
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,959
i found that it didn't really didn't

268
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,199
really help me out too much but i do

269
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,719
like the beastie blooms i think the npk

270
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,520
ratio is like

271
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,280
0 56 0 or something like that straight

272
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,598
up phosphorus you know what i mean

273
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,399
yeah yeah i used to use bc blooms i

274
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,440
think it was what

275
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,799
it's like three four and five a flower i

276
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
think and that just helps out

277
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,079
tremendously because

278
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,799
you know particularly using fox from

279
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,639
trio i used to get a lot of phosphorus

280
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,479
deficiency mid flowering

281
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,559
and using that pk booster the beastie

282
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,159
blooms helps out so much

283
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,799
so much so if anybody's using the fox

284
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,679
farm trio out there and are facing

285
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,359
phosphorus deficiency in flowering you

286
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,639
might want to try beastie blooms because

287
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,000
that solved my problems yeah absolutely

288
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,199
so do you use any sugars or microbial

289
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,039
inoculants i know you said you use

290
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
recharge which has microbes in it use

291
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,360
anything

292
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,278
else beyond that for microbial

293
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,879
inoculants i would say i use

294
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:20,159
the um you know the organic blackstrap

295
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,240
unsulfured molasses by i use plantation

296
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,759
plantation or grandma sort to do that

297
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
that i think are pretty good you know

298
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,720
i also use honey during during the veg

299
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
stage i know a lot of people have been

300
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
asking me on my channel

301
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,600
oh you know do you have any kind of pest

302
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
issues you know because you know honey

303
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,639
sweet you know

304
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
that could that draw like have issues

305
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,958
with bugs and sort of you know that sort

306
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
of thing and

307
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,399
no and the reason i like using honey is

308
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,519
because it is an

309
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,440
excellent root stimulant and you know um

310
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
you know the growth and development of

311
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,360
your roots are like super important

312
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,639
in the veg stage like i feel like the

313
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
roots is something that

314
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
people don't really like especially a

315
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
lot of newer growers out there

316
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,919
you know they just they think what's

317
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,278
important are the leaves and what they

318
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,199
see but like

319
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,480
how they feed you know that you know the

320
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
root system that's the most

321
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
important thing right there for sure so

322
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
when do you usually apply honey

323
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,239
or or molasses and what dosage do you

324
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,799
usually do the honey i do

325
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,639
one tablespoon per gallon and the

326
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,679
molasses i do

327
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,559
about two tablespoons per gallon and the

328
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,759
honey i use

329
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,679
like maybe a week three to

330
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,679
week five you know or until you know

331
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,039
whenever they start flouring it in

332
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:34,078
and then molasses um like i said

333
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,439
two tablespoons per gallon and most of

334
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,519
the flowering stage

335
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
up until maybe week six after that i

336
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,360
kind of just cut it off

337
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,480
and i apply those every like every like

338
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,159
two weeks or so

339
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
got it now when you say week six are you

340
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,240
talking about veg or flour

341
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,759
like when i cut it off yeah flour i'm

342
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
talking about the

343
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,278
molasses okay so molasses you're only

344
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
doing in flour yeah

345
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,000
got it okay that makes sense sometimes i

346
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,679
will i will give it um the first dose

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,278
of molasses like when i start seeing

348
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,639
like pre flowers you know

349
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,838
nice okay so in regards to feeding

350
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,639
autoflowers

351
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,959
and comparing them with photoperiods

352
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,559
some people do treat autoflowers

353
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,319
differently than photoperiods when it

354
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,319
comes to feeding do you

355
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
treat autoflowers differently when it

356
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
comes to feeding when it comes to

357
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,039
feeding

358
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,879
no i treat it pretty much the same

359
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,399
unless i want to veg longer then

360
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,039
the only difference is that you know i'm

361
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,720
just gonna um i'm just gonna keep giving

362
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,319
you know giving it like honey i mean

363
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
that's pretty much it

364
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,000
you know but i i pretty much keep it the

365
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,239
same as far as the feeding

366
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,759
and i know that you also do training on

367
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,639
auto flowers so for example that

368
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,720
skittles that you're growing right now

369
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,600
you uh have done some training to it

370
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,920
tons of tops throughout it uh so what do

371
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
you

372
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,759
so i assume you'd like to maximize yield

373
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,078
what do you typically do

374
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,360
for uh training autoflowers in order to

375
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,679
maximize yield

376
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
um topping i don't do that now the

377
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,439
reason i don't top is because

378
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
with autoflower you know you don't have

379
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
any control which means

380
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,078
they you know they could start flowering

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,278
week three they could start flat you

382
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,638
know they could start flowering week

383
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,039
five or six

384
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,919
and you know if you top too early you're

385
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,399
screwed

386
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,159
but if you top too late that's not good

387
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,919
either you know what i'm saying so

388
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,838
it's a little sketchy you know what i'm

389
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,519
saying so topping is out

390
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,040
lst is king as far as autoflowers lst is

391
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,879
absolutely king

392
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,838
and i i have 62 tops on that skittles

393
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,600
autoflower

394
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
dude it doesn't even fit in the closet

395
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
like it's it's it's coming out

396
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
you know what i'm saying it makes the

397
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,638
closet and the light look

398
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,919
you know it makes the closet look really

399
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,919
small but um

400
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,199
yeah that that one reminds me of

401
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,599
carmilicious i grew

402
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
it was similar to to what you what i saw

403
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
in your skittles

404
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,559
picture it's just bursting out

405
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,919
everywhere and i actually ended up

406
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,319
getting a half pound off of

407
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,679
an autoflower plant before i was pretty

408
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,440
proud of that i know some people might

409
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,919
be watching this in my life oh that's it

410
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
i've gotten more than that but i don't

411
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,120
know what's the highest yield you've

412
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,120
gotten off of an autoflower and do you

413
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,799
think that skittles is

414
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,519
going to be big enough to get over a

415
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:15,120
half pound or what

416
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,240
i got 10 o's on the master kush

417
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,839
and that was an autoflower 10 oh wow you

418
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,879
know

419
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,639
okay i found you know what i'm saying

420
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,039
i'm telling you it's all about training

421
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,959
and

422
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,039
i love low stress training you know

423
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,239
obviously you're not stressing your plan

424
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,599
out at all so

425
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
you know the growth is not stopped the

426
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
growth is constantly going you want to

427
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,199
keep moving you want to keep moving you

428
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,360
know

429
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,199
and um see you wanna form an even canopy

430
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,039
if you have a christmas tree you have

431
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,399
you know the lower bud sites that could

432
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,240
be getting the light they're not getting

433
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
the light they're being covered up so

434
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
they're gonna become airy like popcorn

435
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,198
buds you know what i mean so i love that

436
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,119
i love that

437
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,120
flat top canopy you know what i mean

438
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
except my skittles looks more like a

439
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
look like a wave you know what i mean

440
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,600
but

441
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,278
um that's what you want you want an even

442
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,879
distribution of light that's what low

443
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,639
stress training is to me

444
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,320
and even distribution of light that's

445
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,198
how you get all those colas you know i

446
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,639
mean

447
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,000
i always try to i was trying to

448
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
challenge myself you know what i mean

449
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,399
the most i had

450
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,320
was actually 82 tops on an auto which is

451
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,480
like

452
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,440
ridiculous you know what i mean

453
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,639
yeah that's crazy that's a lot for sure

454
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,880
but i i don't think

455
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,720
as many people really think about the

456
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,198
importance of the veg stage when it

457
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,440
comes to autoflower plants now

458
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,559
like we touched upon before it's on a

459
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,079
living and lifespan

460
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,159
right in my experience growing

461
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,198
autoflowers i've had plants with

462
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:40,958
no stunt growth for the first 30 40 days

463
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,639
and they just became huge versus

464
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,119
you know you're slightly over watering

465
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,039
over an autoflower and veg

466
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,959
you see a stunt growth or if you top it

467
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,078
or even sometimes transplanting that's a

468
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,919
controversial topic

469
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,599
i've tried doing that before and i've

470
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,879
still seen that stunt growth

471
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,879
you know low stress training is low

472
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,799
stress so you know

473
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,240
that's not really going to stunt the

474
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,599
growth uh

475
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,879
if any at all but i really feel like

476
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,920
there's a lot of people that aren't

477
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,759
aware of keeping the plant healthy

478
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,240
and trying to get as big as possible for

479
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,078
those first 30 40 days because after

480
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
that it's going into flowering right so

481
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,078
yeah you know the problem a lot of

482
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,679
people have is everybody tries to

483
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,759
micromanage their grow oh

484
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,879
you know every day oh you know what's

485
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,720
wrong with this leaf what's wrong with

486
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,799
this leaf it's like bro chill out man

487
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,879
you know like dude like when you

488
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,559
micromanage you are gonna over water

489
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,559
because you feel like you need to do

490
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,159
something you oh you know what i mean

491
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,198
and that's where people screw up let me

492
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,399
tell you something this skittles

493
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,799
autoflower

494
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,278
in veg i water twice the entire veg

495
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,639
why i go by the leaves the plant tells

496
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,039
you what it needs

497
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,879
you know like you don't know anything

498
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,480
your plant knows everything you know

499
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,078
you feed it accordingly you water

500
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,278
accordingly you know what i mean that's

501
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,120
pretty much what i do

502
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,198
so for that particular plant you started

503
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,799
in a solo cup what day do you remember

504
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,758
what day you transplanted

505
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,599
into that larger container is it a 7

506
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,440
gallon or 10 gallon

507
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,560
this one is a 7 gallon okay um

508
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,720
i don't remember maybe maybe 10 days

509
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,919
the rule of thumb that i go by once the

510
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
leaves start

511
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,360
sticking out of out of the perimeter of

512
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,399
the cup you have maybe like

513
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,278
an extra couple of days before you know

514
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,720
you might

515
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,320
you know you don't want to get root

516
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
bound so that's when you

517
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
you know that's when i transplant do you

518
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
sprinkle any mycorrhizal fungi on the

519
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
roots during transplant or

520
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
yes i used mycos i i've been using that

521
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
since the get-go

522
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,600
um actually i started using micros

523
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,599
because cali green

524
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
he's the guy that that i first started

525
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,278
watching you know all these grow videos

526
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
like he's my coast and ever since i was

527
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,159
like i'm just going i'm just gonna keep

528
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,919
using michaels all the time

529
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,519
you know so i spread that around the

530
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,000
root ball i think that's one of the

531
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,078
things that's

532
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,639
just so beneficial that some gardeners

533
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,198
don't use is mycorrhizae i mean

534
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
it definitely helps with the transplant

535
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,479
shock

536
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
reducing the chances of that because it

537
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
feels like every time i use that there's

538
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,038
like no

539
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,078
slow growth at all and i think that's

540
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,078
one thing that should be in

541
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,359
everybody's garden is using mycorrhizal

542
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,359
one guy yeah

543
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,639
i think a lot of people here's the thing

544
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,558
though like when you first start growing

545
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,240
and you look at different resources

546
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,000
everybody's shoving nutrients down your

547
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,519
throat you know what i mean oh fox

548
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,279
farm's the best all you know this

549
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,918
brand's the best this brand's the best

550
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,078
nobody really talks about like you know

551
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,079
the microbes and you know

552
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,918
i think the most important thing for

553
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,279
your root system to have to make your

554
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,120
plant grow vigorously

555
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,678
is you need oxygen and you need microbes

556
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,599
you know which equals an aerobic

557
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
environment and that's what you want

558
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,719
absolutely so let me recap real quick

559
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,160
before we move on to the next topic so

560
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,839
you know for autoflowers in particular

561
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,919
you start off in a solo cup

562
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,199
around day 10 or so you'll transplant

563
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,720
into a seven gallon

564
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,759
now that seven gallon is a mixture

565
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,279
usually of

566
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,119
fox farm happy frog and ocean forest

567
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,279
is that right and then from there you're

568
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,239
doing a top dressing with

569
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,879
ilgm bloom nutrients right those are

570
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,359
what dry

571
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
organic nutrients uh i only do that once

572
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,719
in a while no they're not they are

573
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,119
they're soluble okay so what points do

574
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
you

575
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,279
feed again do you do like a top dressing

576
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
at a certain point um i actually top

577
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,200
dress with

578
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,798
with down the earth fishbone meal okay

579
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
fishbone meal i put around

580
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,960
maybe a week three or four now what some

581
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,599
people don't know

582
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,558
is that fish bone meals week sorry week

583
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,000
three or four of

584
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:38,000
flour so you've gone 30 days and then

585
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
21 days later roughly it's around day

586
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,759
50ish

587
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
is when you're doing that day 50 like

588
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,879
are you talking about from sprout

589
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
oh yeah from yeah that's about right

590
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
that's about right got it okay

591
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,160
i top dressed with fish bone meal from

592
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,038
down to earth and what a lot of people

593
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
don't understand

594
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,079
is it's good to start that a little

595
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
maybe a week earlier you know i mean

596
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,199
instead of like week five because it

597
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,279
takes a little while

598
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,360
for that fishbowl meal to break down you

599
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,558
know to become accessible so that that's

600
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,240
one thing i try to

601
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,160
i try to tell people about that but

602
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,400
fishbell meal is great man i mean

603
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
that's phosphorus right there you know i

604
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,519
think i think the npk

605
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,000
was like i think like 1 12 0 or

606
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,319
something

607
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,759
though got it so it's just that for top

608
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,720
dressing and then you do molasses

609
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,599
every week or so every week or two

610
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,519
throughout flour

611
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,798
and then well up to a week six of flour

612
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,359
and then recharge

613
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,400
every week throughout the whole life no

614
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,399
just veg

615
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,038
just veg okay just veggies and burnt

616
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,798
flour i put in my own compost thing

617
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,798
oh okay all right is that around the

618
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,480
same time the week three or

619
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:45,359
um yeah yeah that yeah no maybe week two

620
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,839
maybe week three um i think week two is

621
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,839
pretty good

622
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,359
week two of flour that's when i start

623
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,079
putting in the compost tea

624
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,639
and what i like to use with the compost

625
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,558
tea for

626
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,480
and anyone that's interested i like

627
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,599
using alfalfa meal

628
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,558
i like using kelp meal i love

629
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,599
seabird guano likes you know if you want

630
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,759
phosphorus

631
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,639
seabird guano is is what you need you

632
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,839
know and i use earthworm castings

633
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,880
as well from uh you know wiggly worm and

634
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,959
you know of course i also use um i use

635
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,960
the organic blackstrap molasses and i i

636
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
put that all together you know

637
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,880
and i i brew that for about 30 hours

638
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,199
after i declare water for 24 hours

639
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
so i add that into the flour as well got

640
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
it so that's your

641
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
flour recipe that was a good transition

642
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,798
by the way to to get into compost lake

643
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
tea which is our

644
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,400
our next avenue here oh yeah yeah yeah

645
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,038
so that's your flower recipe

646
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,240
for compost tea and then do you have a

647
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,519
separate recipe

648
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,159
for veg compost teas um no

649
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,279
actually veg i just use recharge because

650
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,200
it's been i mean

651
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:54,480
you know what i mean and then for

652
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,279
i'm sorry for your ratios what ratios do

653
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,279
you use

654
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,558
for um those nutrients in the compost

655
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,798
tea all the compost

656
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,319
trying to remember i i used two to four

657
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,279
tablespoons of

658
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,480
the blackstrap molasses alfalfa meal and

659
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,720
kelp meal

660
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,759
i do you know i do one tablespoon of

661
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
that i do

662
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:16,000
one cup of seabird guano

663
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,000
and one cup of worm castings i believe

664
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,119
is that for a five gallon bucket five

665
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,159
gallon bucket and i

666
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,519
fill it with uh three gallons so you

667
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
know because if i if i have a five

668
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,400
gallon and a five gallon

669
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,919
you know it's gonna be a lot of spillage

670
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,679
you know what i mean so

671
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
yeah pretty good with a three because

672
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
i'm using a seven gallon pot

673
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,678
three gallons pretty good got it and

674
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,719
then how long do you let it brew for

675
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,240
about 28 36 hours

676
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,440
okay and then do you ph adjust it at all

677
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,679
yes um after everything is done i ph

678
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,960
adjust it because my water is like

679
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,240
7.8 8.0 so i adjust it

680
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
i like it between 6.0 to 6.4

681
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,599
you know that that's where i'm getting

682
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,079
the real optimal results got it now do

683
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,240
you also

684
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,519
dilute some people will dilute the tea

685
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,038
so they take the tea

686
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,038
they'll add it in with additional water

687
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,599
do you do any type of diluting at all or

688
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,759
did you just

689
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,038
feed it straight to the plant no i don't

690
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,960
i just pour right in

691
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,200
okay all right and then what equipment

692
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,319
do you use to brew the teas

693
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,319
um i use the eunuch life ul 40 air pump

694
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,119
i think it was like 30 40 bucks

695
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,038
obviously the 5 gallon bucket and i you

696
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,599
know i attach a hose from

697
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,240
from the uniclife to the you know to air

698
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,959
stones

699
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
and that's how i get bubbling up i also

700
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
think it's important

701
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,279
a lot of people don't really talk about

702
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,319
this i don't know if it really makes a

703
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,960
difference but

704
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,599
i think it might i do like to oxygenate

705
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,720
the water

706
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,240
like um you know when i'm not when i'm

707
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,798
not having the tea

708
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
like while it's declining for 24 hours i

709
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,200
just

710
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,880
throw the air stones in there and i i

711
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,600
bubble it for that 24 hours you know

712
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,720
because

713
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,158
i feel like um you know you know there's

714
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,519
different water out there you know

715
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
there's different different water

716
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,158
different cities

717
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,839
you know the quality of water is

718
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
different sand and some of the waters

719
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,839
don't have enough oxygen

720
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,798
even though you know water is h2o with a

721
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,720
molecule of

722
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,038
oxygen you know i i think it's important

723
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,038
to oxygenate the water i think it's just

724
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,440
going to help

725
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,038
help to help maintain that aerobic

726
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,759
environment for your plants

727
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,558
so how often do you feed in that tea i

728
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,359
feed about

729
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,319
every 10 to 14 days i think every two

730
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,798
weeks is pretty good

731
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,359
so do you check like the ph or ppm of

732
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,480
like the

733
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,798
soil runoff at all or or i do that

734
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,880
i i actually do not i don't check the

735
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,200
runoff i've never had any issues you

736
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
know

737
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,798
i think on on the t side of things when

738
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,919
you're using organic

739
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,519
inputs like you are arguably you don't

740
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,159
you won't really need to

741
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,119
check the ph of the runoff uh in that

742
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,440
particular case

743
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,879
so now do you just use the tees as a

744
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
sill drench or do you also

745
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
foliar feed using the tees i do i use

746
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,519
the foliar spray when i have you know

747
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,159
when i'm

748
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,200
um mixing in the recharge i put i'll put

749
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
some in a mist

750
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,440
like a mist spray bottle you know um but

751
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,278
mostly i do a soil drench

752
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,558
all right we talked about quite a bit in

753
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,079
this one actually we hammered through

754
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,158
this pretty quickly here

755
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,000
how can the listeners find you and what

756
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
do you have upcoming in the future

757
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,919

with me talking let me interview you and

791
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
pick your brains a little bit about

792
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
how you do your autoflowers which you've

793
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,519
been very successful on i mean just just

794
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,000
look at his instagram you can see the

795
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,480
size

796
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,599
of his autoflowers that he's growing and

797
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,759
knowing kind of the

798
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,119
the nitty-gritty details on how you do

799
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,640
things when it comes to autoflowers i

800
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,879
think they're going to be beneficial for

801

for those listening so and also the

802
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,200
compost teas which we talked about

803
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,480
and i think you just did a nutrient tea

804
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
i haven't watched it yet or

805
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,400
