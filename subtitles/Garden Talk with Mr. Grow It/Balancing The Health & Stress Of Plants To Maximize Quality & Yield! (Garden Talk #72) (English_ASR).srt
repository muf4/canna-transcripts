1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,359
coming up on Garden talk once I tried

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,480
cocoa I just I never looked back you

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,940
know the ability to control EC and water

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,780
content and all the variables of cocoa

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:17,939
are just so easy if you stress them a

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,460
little bit and make them think in flour

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,920
like you know this might be the end

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,939
they're going to go into a hyper growth

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,060
mode they're going to put out more

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,800
calyxes and so really you want to make

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,320
sure that from the time that cutting

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,079
roots or that seed Pops that you have

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,340
momentum through the entire process I

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,200
found that that's one of the biggest

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,780
things that will lead to a decreased

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,660
yield and so all of those things are

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,160
basically telling the plant like hey you

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,419
need to get on it so I do think that

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,479
there's a lot of those techniques that

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,200
can lead to the much larger harvests

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,199
foreign

22
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,718

have to talk to us about today but first

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,780
can you tell us a little bit about

71
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,340
yourself and how you got into gardening

72
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,780
yeah sure

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,280
um so I'm co-owner and CEO of uh grow

74
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,019
strong Industries

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,780
um and grow strong Industries is the

76
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,360
parent brand for Gorilla Grow Tent kind

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,580
LED grow lights Lotus nutrients and

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,220
supraponics

79
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,980
um and so I guess uh my plant medicine

80
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:11,699
Journey kind of started uh growing up in

81
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:14,598
Portland Oregon uh in the mid 90s uh and

82
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:18,959
I was lucky enough to be surrounded

83
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:21,419
by a very talented cultivators and some

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,939
of the best plant medicine on the planet

85
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,158
really at that time

86
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,500
um and so that's kind of really where my

87
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:33,179
interest in plant medicine uh all

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,719
started and then in 97 I moved out to

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,939
Colorado to be a ski bomb and a couple

90
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,639
of my friends at the time were doing

91
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,318
indoor gardens uh in the mountains of

92
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,359
Colorado and that's really where my

93
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,119
interest in indoor gardening started or

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,879
my fascination with it really you know

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,340
the fact that these guys were growing uh

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,500
you know huge rooms uh you know above

97
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,780
you know ten thousand feet in elevation

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,519
uh you know in the middle of winter when

99
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,560
it was snowing with five feet of snow on

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,620
the ground it was really just kind of

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,360
mind blowing going to me and that's

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,000
really where my interest kind of got

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,519
going I was lucky enough to start

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,860
helping them you know which is General

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
Garden maintenance you know start kind

106
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,660
of getting tips and tricks and starting

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,180
to learn you know the lay of the land uh

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,460
and then in 2001 I moved out to

109
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,019
California

110
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:26,698
at that time California was just kind of

111
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,620
blossoming from you know some medical

112
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,860
laws that had just been passed about

113
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,519
five years earlier and that's when I

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,560
started running my own indoor gardens

115
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,198
um and uh you know I've been doing it

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,379
ever since you know I've been involved

117
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,699
in small gardens large Gardens outdoor

118
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:50,418
indoor I've kind of really ran the gamut

119
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:53,819
with my um you know cultivation

120
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:56,758
experience and exposure uh and kind of

121
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,040
through those trial and errors which

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,500
every grower goes through you know

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,379
that's kind of what led me to be able to

124
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,180
design mean products for gross wrong

125
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,978
Industries and all those brands that

126
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,759
really kind of solve the pain points

127
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,500
that a lot of growers face

128
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,080
and so you know that's kind of a decade

129
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,839
on from now uh you know designing all

130
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,219
those products uh and and kind of you

131
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,619
know doing what our core mission is

132
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,620
which is you know giving everybody the

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,620
chance to have availability to plant

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,500
medicine that they grew that they saw

135
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,939
through the process is you know I mean

136
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,240
that's kind of what keeps us going here

137
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,459
awesome and I just do want to say thank

138
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,379

139
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,180
Industries is actually a sponsor so I

140
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,279
know a lot of the viewers have seen

141
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,439
probably the promotions I've done for

142
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239

143

145
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,779
of these episodes wouldn't even be out

146
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,679
there without sponsorship support and uh

147
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,879
you know being able to release content

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
normalize is eventually going to help

149
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,139
legalize in the future so thank you you

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,120
for supporting the community absolutely

151
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,680
man absolutely I mean we're on the same

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,259
mission right I mean we're trying to

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,819
teach people uh you know how to have

154
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,800
access to their own plant medicine how

155
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,020
to grow it um you know that goes for

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,939
indoors that goes for outdoors

157
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,978
um you know I mean we believe really

158
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,379
that that kind of is a human right you

159
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,939
know is to be able to grow your own

160
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,680
vegetables and plant medicine and

161
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,079
everything else so we're uh we're

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,360
aligned in that way I completely agree

163
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,180
so there are so many different ways to

164
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,740
grow plants right different styles I

165
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,620
guess you can call it some people grow

166
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,860
indoors Outdoors some people are in soil

167
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,019
or cocoa or even a hydroponic system

168
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,939
organic synthetic what's your gross

169
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,918
style yeah

170
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,199
um I mean growing Outdoors is beautiful

171
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,538
right I mean utilizing mother nature for

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,720
most everything you need uh is is

173
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,180
beautiful uh and I love it but really

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,340
you know in terms of plant medicine

175
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,259
indoors has always been my realm

176
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,939
um and largely that's you know what our

177
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,879
company does uh you know is make

178
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,439
products for indoor cultivation you know

179
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,019
there's something about indoor that just

180
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,478
allows you to kind of control uh you

181
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,560
know what is going on control the inputs

182
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,779
to

183
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,180
um you know to the plant and you know

184
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,818
honestly as we all know you know the

185
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,240
quality of uh what comes out of an

186
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,560
indoor facility is is Bar None

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,180
um you know so I've always been an

188
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,720
indoor guy

189
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,180
um you know for many years I was soil uh

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,500
and I love soil it's great

191
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,840
um you know but once I tried cocoa I

192
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,598
just I never looked back

193
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,939
um you know the ability to control EC

194
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,360
and water content and all the variables

195
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,339
of cocoa are just so easy

196
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,979
um and then you know when you look at

197
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,418
the root base that you can make in Cocoa

198
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:57,719
I mean you're talking about a medium

199
00:07:54,418 --> 00:08:00,418
that can have 90 water saturation and

200
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,639
still have plenty of air to create a

201
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:04,500
massive root base I mean when and I saw

202
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
the root bases that I was able to

203
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,839
achieve in Cocoa I was like There's No

204
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,539
Going Back you know and so Coco has been

205
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,138
my style for you know probably the last

206
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:18,300
10 years and I love it you know I use

207
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,038
the two per mix from Royal gold those

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,598
guys are awesome they're super good at

209
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,399
what they do

210
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:27,060
um and so you know it's always been

211
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:29,579
cocoa for me and then in terms of uh you

212
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,860
know fertilizer you know I tend to move

213
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:35,059
away from the synthetic terminology but

214
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,918
I do use fertilizer salt formulations

215
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,918
you know I use my nutrient which is

216
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,439
lotus nutrients it's a super simplistic

217
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,899
it's a you know kind of all-in-one blend

218
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
I've really never seen anything easier

219
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,220
to use I mean back in the day when I was

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,959
doing soil I'd have a 12 part nutrient

221
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,399
recipe that was honestly a pain in the

222
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,458
butt to keep up with it's super

223
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,278
expensive so moving to something like

224
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,599
Lotus was was great you know which is

225
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,019
you know kind of what drove the

226
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,440
innovation of that that product

227
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:10,500
and you know I in in terms of my end

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
goal uh in indoor cultivation is always

229
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,839
for the highest amount of biomass I can

230
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,019
possibly get out of the inputs that I'm

231
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,660
putting in uh and that ultimate bag

232
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,700
appeal right I mean I want the plant

233
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,159
medicine that's in a jar across the room

234
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,019
and you say what the hell is that you

235
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,719
know and I've always found that you know

236
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,639
fertilizing salts over Organics is the

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,899
way to achieve the combo of both of

238
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,939
those

239
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,100
um believe me I'm an advocate for

240
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,140
organic you know I mean organic out in

241
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,200
the vegetable garden always

242
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,399
and uh you know the flavor profiles uh

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,680
of the smoke that you can get from

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,419
organic is second to none

245
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,000
um you know but for a lot of our clients

246
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,919
uh commercial and home hobbyists they're

247
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,019
really looking to maximize weight and

248
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,360
quality uh which is why we've always

249
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,980
tended towards fertilizer salts gotcha

250
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,740
yeah I think there's a I think there's a

251
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,180
balance between biomass and quality

252
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,919
right you could just go for biomass

253
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,199
biomass biomass then all of a sudden you

254
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,838
have like Fox tailing buds for example

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,940
it's just that it diminishes that bag

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
appeal so like there are things that you

257
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,399
can do in order to get a high biomass

258
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,559
but also sustain that quality and that's

259
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,620
really what this topic is going to be

260
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,958
today so let's start with uh let's start

261
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,360
with lighting can you tell us like what

262
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:30,179
grow light do you currently use

263
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,500
obviously kinda LED is the is the brand

264
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,539
that I use

265
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,159
um you know currently I'm growing with

266
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,199
our x squared which is our commercial

267
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,000
fixture

268
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,920
um you know and it's a beast of the

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,720
light it puts out you know a ton of

270
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,399
usable photons

271
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,100
um you know and I think it's a this is a

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,740
good uh starting point uh you know to

273
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,959
talk about this you know health of the

274
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,539
plant being the base versus the stress

275
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,338
that we're giving you know the plant

276
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,500
um you know because really and you know

277
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,959
there's a lot of uh really high powered

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,940
LEDs out on the market today that

279
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,819
honestly I think a lot of people have no

280
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,839
clue what to even do with them at full

281
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,060
power

282
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,240
right if you don't have all of the other

283
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,278
inputs in your room 100 dialed you are

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,899
not going to be able to utilize all of

285
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,559
the photons coming out of that light

286
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:23,100
right and those variables are easy it's

287
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,679
water content it's CO2 levels it's VPD

288
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,259
levels like all of those things need to

289
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,899
be dead on in order for you to even be

290
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,519
able to utilize a thousand ppfd at plant

291
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,839
pnfu level

292
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,639
um you know I've actually seen some of

293
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,320
your past guests that talk about like oh

294
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,360
man I just need to use that light at 50

295
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,720
right

296
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,980
um and uh and so it's like you know it's

297
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,480
probably the fact that they're getting

298
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,278
better growth because some of their

299
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,379
other variables are off and not to knock

300
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,778
their growing style you know but that's

301
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,240
typically if you turn your light up and

302
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,679
you see light stress happening that's

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
that's what you're seeing you're seeing

304
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,819
that the other variables aren't up to

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,759
Snuff and that engine is running too

306
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,440
fast for the other pieces to keep up

307
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,480
with right

308
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,820
um and so uh you know I think it's

309
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,259
really important to have all of the

310
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,600
balance between these things that we're

311
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:17,100
about to talk about in order to utilize

312
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,560
that high ppfd lighting you know and so

313
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,200
uh and so for me the X2 is the best it's

314
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,000
got a variable Spectrum I can uh you

315
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,540
know tune it to a veg Spectrum I can

316
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,980
tune it to a flower spectrum

317
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:32,278
and with what we call the targeted

318
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,740
Spectrum which is basically you know us

319
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,539
not relying so much on you know white

320
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,278
light LED that's got really high peaks

321
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,719
and the yellows and the greens that you

322
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,919
know five to six hundred nanometer

323
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
wavelength

324
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,039
um you know but it kind of has a more

325
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,379
targeted Spectrum which is a more usable

326
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,000
Spectrum to the plant we you know find

327
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,159
that we can really crank all those

328
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,278
variables up we can get really high EC

329
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,159
we can utilize CO2 to the Max and we can

330
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,838
get some pretty outstanding uh uh you

331
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,299
know weights from our harvests as a

332
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,339
result of it and so you know in terms of

333
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,599
stress for light level typically those

334
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,300
aren't going to be good for the plant

335
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,540
right when we talk about you know the

336
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,278
benefits stressors to the quality of

337
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,639
flour when it comes to light we're more

338
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,220
talking about uh UV light uh you know

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,019
and exciting the uvr8 protein to kind of

340
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,399
crank up that secondary metabolite

341
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,659
production

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,458
um you know we have people that

343
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:25,620
drastically change their Spectrum the

344
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,479
last like week of flower right they

345
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,399
crank all their Reds down all their

346
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,959
whites down and go with the heavy blue

347
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,480
and that's same thing it's stressing the

348
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,239
plant out and and kind of kicking up

349
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,920
that secondary metabolite production and

350
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,180
so there are little tips and tricks that

351
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,799
you can do with lighting to kind of

352
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,899
bring out that stress

353
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,059
but if you're talking about low light

354
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,278
levels or highlight levels those are the

355
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,278
typically the stressors that don't

356
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:53,519
benefit you uh and more kind of lock out

357
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,439
your plant if anything gotcha for the

358
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,179
record I'm one of the ones that dim my

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,760
grow lights in order to to get through

360
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,159
my grill because I don't supplement CO2

361
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,278
like I'm not running a 1400 PPM and so

362
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,078
CO2 is my limiting factor right so like

363
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,879
if I don't dim my lights I'm going to

364
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,099
fry my plants because my CO2 levels

365
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,320
aren't up there now I started using some

366
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,759
CO2 and we'll get into CO2 later on in

367
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,980
this episode because that is something

368
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,039
that can be used to increase biomass

369
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,899
which is on the topic here but uh but

370
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,599
yeah for the most part I do like to dim

371
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,519
my lights and make sure that uh I'm not

372
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,560
running into foxtail issues which

373
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,019
happens to me a lot the heat raises up

374
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,698
Fox telling occurs and like we mentioned

375
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,698
earlier the the bag appeal just kind of

376
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:37,799
diminishes on that Avenue so yeah Dives

377
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:40,078
yeah yeah I mean look I've given you

378
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,939
know that X2 to friends or the x squared

379
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,638
to friends of mine mine who have been

380
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,860
growing longer than me you know and and

381
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,680
do it on a commercial scale and it takes

382
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,300
them uh you know a minute to get used to

383
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,799
how much light is actually coming out of

384
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,299
that fixture and I'm always like man you

385
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,539
got to go harder you got to go harder

386
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,278
CO2 EC and you know old school grower

387
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,919
mentality it's like ah I can't really

388
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,240
like press this threshold and then they

389
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,679
finally learned that like you have to

390
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,659
Crest that threshold and when they do

391
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,399
they're like oh my God it was like

392
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,799
amazing the results that I started

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,419
getting right so I mean the whole

394
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,559
growing in general has been flipped on

395
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,659
its head

396
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,638
um in the past you know five years or so

397
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,159
I mean some of the things that we never

398
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,659
thought to do or never thought were safe

399
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,219
zones and we'll get into that with the

400
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,379
BPD thing

401
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,759
um is now like oh that is where I want

402
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,338
to be and look at the you know look at

403
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,740
the the effect of that so

404
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,959
so you touched upon how you use your

405
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,120
grow light to maximize the yield and

406
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,338
quality you talked about light levels

407
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,019
and Spectrum but kind of getting a

408
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,139
little bit more detailed onto light

409
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:46,139
levels par now there are some people who

410
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,419
go for specific par levels throughout

411
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,180
the different stages of growth or some

412
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,338
people look at DLI is there any specific

413
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,719
par levels that you're targeting for the

414
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,300
different stages of growth in order to

415
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,579
maximize yield or quality when you look

416
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,679
at certain plant medicines

417
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:04,099
um you know DLI is anywhere in the kind

418
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,599
of like 40 to 45 range

419
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,759
the problem with sometimes reaching

420
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,740
those DLI levels is that when you're

421
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,139
reaching maximum DLI levels which would

422
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,480
be maximum ppfd levels of plant canopy

423
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,000
to achieve that uh you know divided by

424
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,620
the hours number uh number of hours your

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,799
light is on

426
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,019
um you know it really rolls back to all

427
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,419
those other variables you know I mean I

428
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,778
would say in a typical home growth

429
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,179
scenario getting over seven or eight

430
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:35,399
hundred ppfd at plant canopy level is

431
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,979
probably going to give you more problems

432
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,100
than it is benefit

433
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,860
um and so if we could speak in terms of

434
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,839
like 100 dialed environment

435
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,459
um you know commercial environment yeah

436
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,240
I mean I would say you know clothing

437
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:52,859
stage you're looking at 150-ish uh ppfd

438
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,659
is plenty

439
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,480
um you know to to carry out the cloning

440
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:01,198
process uh you know young veg you know

441
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,180
anywhere from four to four fifty ppfd is

442
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,119
usually what we target

443
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,918
um and then in flower you know I do have

444
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,719
people that slowly ramp up through

445
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,640
flowering it's never really been my

446
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,078
style I kind of go all or nothing from

447
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,880
the beginning

448
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,459
um and so you know I'm usually in that

449
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,559
800 to a thousand

450
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,600
um a thousand is tough though right I

451
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,519
mean a thousand like you better have all

452
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,798
of your other variables dead on in order

453
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,720
for that to turn out well

454
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,759
um but if you do the results are amazing

455
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,860
right and so you know I would probably

456
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,740
say I tend more towards that 800-ish

457
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:37,798
range um because you know I I can be

458
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,779
lazy sometimes about uh you know making

459
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,480
sure that you know my temp and humidity

460
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,700
are perfectly dialed uh you know and so

461
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,200
and so sometimes you know when you don't

462
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,480
have those controls when everything's

463
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,798
not completely automated you know

464
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,599
tending towards the lower end of that

465
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,099
spectrum is better uh and it's

466
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,678
counterintuitive to the way most people

467
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:58,379
think right wait I give my plant less

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,360
light and it does better you know but

469
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,900
but really it just has to do with that

470
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,359
the harmony amongst all of those things

471
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,940
um so yeah you know probably about that

472
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,918
800-ish range in full flower the the

473
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,320
margin of error is much less at those

474
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,120
lower ppfd levels right I mean you can

475
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,038
have a EC swing you can have a water

476
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,839
content swing you know and it doesn't

477
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,179
affect the plant as much when you're

478
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,279
redlining it like it better all be on

479
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,100
you know so so you already mentioned

480
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,160
you're using Lotus nutrients do you aim

481
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,619
for different EC or PPM during the

482
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,640
different stages of growth yeah yeah I

483
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,099
do

484
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,660
um you know and again it really has to

485
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,939
do with the amount of light that you're

486
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,500
giving your your plants you know all

487
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,080
your other variables again all these

488
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,599
variables kind of count on each other to

489
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,879
you know give you the level of which you

490
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,740
know what you take lighting to or ec2

491
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,720
and everything else so you know when

492
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,038
using High ppfd lighting like the x

493
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,480
squared

494
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,419
um you know I mean I come right out of

495
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,919
the gates at about a thousand PPM which

496
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,559
I've told people that and they're like

497
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,419
whoa like really you know

498
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,819
um and you know I've noticed that if you

499
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,740
don't you can get a little clone to lock

500
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,178
out pretty quick because with that

501
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,940
amount of light and with CO2

502
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:17,038
augmentation it just wants to go uh you

503
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,480
know so 1000 PPM that's what 200 2.0 EC

504
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,619
um you know I'm typically drifting

505
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,620
towards probably 1300 uh you know

506
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,178
towards the latter stages of you know

507
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,459
the vegetative stage

508
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,519
um in into flowering which is about 2.6

509
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,380
EC and then uh you know through the

510
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,599
first you know about every two weeks in

511
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,900
flower I'm stepping it up about 100 PPM

512
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:43,678
until I get to about 1800

513
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,360
um which is you know 3.2 EC uh and

514
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,220
sometimes I feel like that's not even

515
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,399
enough I mean the plants are just

516
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,600
soaking it up and just taking it

517
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,240
um and I have a lot of commercial

518
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,619
clients that are growing way higher than

519
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,940
that I mean I've got a lot of people

520
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:01,739
that are in that 3.6 to 3.8 EC range you

521
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,779
know when you talk about uh you know

522
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,319
crop steering techniques I mean

523
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:09,839
sometimes they're touching the like 5.0

524
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:11,819
range which is insane to me uh you know

525
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,099
and obviously you know if you if you

526
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,779
don't have an automated system uh you

527
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,399
know similar to like an aurora you're

528
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,700
playing a fire there you know and you're

529
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,000
playing with fire above 3.0 EC uh if

530
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,100
everything else isn't 100 dial

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,659
um but so yeah so I kind of slowly ramp

532
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,158
up through flour and you know I usually

533
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,919
end at 3.2

534
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,419
okay and then how about pH a lot of

535
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
people monitor the pH I know you said

536
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:38,759
you're in Cocoa there's different pH

537
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:41,339
ranges for soil versus cocoa what do you

538
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,319
do for pH yeah I mean I'll have to admit

539
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,918
pH is something that I don't check all

540
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:51,000
the time and here's why uh it's because

541
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,640
I know the pH of my input water I know

542
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,740
my nutrients really well I know where

543
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,538
when I mix to a certain nutrient

544
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,579
strength it's going to be it about this

545
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:02,579
pH and I know how much up and down to

546
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,558
choose right and so for me it's like I

547
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,500
don't check it every time but I am

548
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,779
trying to go into that 6.0 to 6.2 range

549
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,099
in Cocoa

550
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,359
um you know soil obviously you're

551
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,298
drifting a little bit higher sometimes

552
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,099
all the way up to like 6.5 6.6 and in

553
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,500
Hydro you're obviously going lower you

554
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,019
know all the way down to like 5.5 Coco

555
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm trying to stay in that 6.0 to 6.2

556
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,259
range

557
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,000
um and uh you know it's like that's one

558
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,558
of those things where sometimes after

559
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,880
you've grown for a while after you kind

560
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,740
of get used to the new nutrient program

561
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,320
that you're using it becomes kind of

562
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,120
intuitive right and that goes for

563
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,939
feeding too I mean sometimes I'll be in

564
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,558
there and I'll be on a you know 1500 PPM

565
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,179
level and I'm like yeah they look like

566
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,500
they want a little bit more and I'll you

567
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,720
know I'll give them a little bit more

568
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,798
and sometimes same thing I'll be like ah

569
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,298
you know it looks like a little bit of

570
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,759
Tipper and I'll pull back a little bit

571
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,179
and so you know it's I think it's

572
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,500
important to kind of be intuitive in

573
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,940
gardening too and not just always

574
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,220
following the instruments not just

575
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,440
always following the recipe because that

576
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,480
can get you into trouble you know and

577
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,279
that's largely the you know issue I have

578
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,620
with these full automations that we're

579
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,960
seeing these days is like it's a plant

580
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,879
you know like it wants to be loved it

581
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,319
wants to be paid attention to and you

582
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,120
know every once in a while you need to

583
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,798
kind of adjust your game plan based on

584
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,819
your intuition of what you're seeing in

585
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,240
the plant

586
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,939
I've had really good luck doing 5.8 pH

587
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,640
going in to Cocoa I feel like that's a

588
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,400
little bit more simple than soil at

589
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,320
times controlling BH because I feel like

590
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,360
soil has so many things in the actual

591
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,759
medium that's adjusting the pH right

592
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,918
plants releasing acids there's microbes

593
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,019
in there so on and so forth but yeah for

594
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,480
a p for cocoa in particular since you're

595
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,298
a cocoa girl I forgot to mention it 5.8

596
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,700
pH is is what I do so and I actually do

597
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:49,139
start a little bit under 6.0 I usually

598
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,058
start at like five nine which is a weird

599
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,980
number uh and then slowly kind of raise

600
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:54,480
it up over the over the course which

601
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,558
kind of just naturally happens as I

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,558
build strength uh in my nutrient program

603
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,599
um and uh you know so it and I mean

604
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,819
runoff is an important one right I mean

605
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,439
I in fact I think it's almost for me

606
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,298
more important to check my runoff every

607
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,179
once in a while than it is to check my

608
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,259
in you know inbound nutrient solution uh

609
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,120
just to make sure that there's nothing

610
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,400
funky going on in the medium so I would

611
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,339
100 recommend that to anybody that's

612
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,159
growing Coke or soil you know and then

613
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,599
in terms of like stressing with nutrient

614
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,980
strength

615
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,298
I don't really think there's anything

616
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,220
there

617
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,918
um you know in terms of quality I mean I

618
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,079
think if you under feed uh I don't think

619
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,419
that will ever really go too well for

620
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,918
you unless your inputs are off and then

621
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,860
it could be as what the thing that saves

622
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,080
your garden right is by interfeeding

623
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,459
um you know over feeding yeah if you

624
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,519
have all your inputs on you can really

625
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,400
kind of get to that you know level of

626
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,980
pushing the plant ultimately making a

627
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,019
healthy base for it but if you talk

628
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,960
about the irrigation side of things and

629
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,579
the water content in the medium now

630
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,400
you're talking about a stress that can

631
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,678
have a beneficial effect on the plant

632
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,080
um you know I don't I I'm kind of a

633
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,640
wildflower nut and they always say the

634
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,099
best year to go out and see wildflowers

635
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,320
is after a drought year which has kind

636
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,778
of counter-intuitive but that's the

637
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,058
plant saying oh my God we don't have

638
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:20,339
enough water to survive and so they end

639
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:21,899
up making more seed stock and drop it on

640
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,139
the ground because for an annual that's

641
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,820
the point is to continue on with life

642
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,400
um and so it's the same thing with plant

643
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,500
medicines you know if you stress them a

644
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,019
little bit and make them think in flour

645
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,419
like it you know this might be the end

646
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,440
they're going to go into a hyper growth

647
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,740
mode they're going to put out more

648
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,720
calyxes that are for hopefully in nature

649
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,940
they would want that to become a seed we

650
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,278
don't want that in indoor growing

651
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,140
um and you know but that's kind of the

652
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,880
the mode they go into they go into

653
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,480
survival mode and they say I need to

654
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,039
regenerate as much as possible uh to you

655
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,200
know to counteract the conditions that

656
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,519
I'm being put in

657
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,259
um and you know you want the exact

658
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,558
opposite when you're in vegetative stage

659
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,538
you want that stress to be non-existent

660
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,639
you want the fastest most healthy robust

661
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,798
growth you can get so that's why we want

662
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,080
more water content and soil during that

663
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,639
period but then once you get into flour

664
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,038
letting them kind of dry a little bit

665
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
you know it's called a dry back and in

666
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,839
crop steering techniques uh is actually

667
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,058
a kind of a good stressor for the plant

668
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,500
okay so drought stress I was even

669
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,839
thinking about that that yeah so so

670
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,480
you're saying later on in flowering

671
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,178
around what weeks would you say would

672
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,519
you typically do drought stress yeah

673
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,320
typically I mean you know in in crop

674
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,298
steering techniques they say after week

675
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,918
three right I mean weeks one through

676
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:42,720
three that's where it's still really

677
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,580
kind of in a vegetative stage it's in

678
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,960
that stretch stage once it gets into

679
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,579
week three you've got good flower

680
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,860
development and that's when you kind of

681
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:52,558
want to start introducing that stress

682
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:55,439
um you know which is basically you know

683
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,139
when you irrigate right um You irrigate

684
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,480
you cut off your irrigation

685
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,038
more towards the middle of the day so if

686
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,659
in Cocoa if you're doing high frequency

687
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,000
fertigation and you're doing multiple

688
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,520
shots or irrigation times through the

689
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,319
day you want to cut that off you know

690
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,019
three or four hours before your lights

691
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,819
turn off and let that dry period kind of

692
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:16,619
go for a little bit longer than you

693
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,119
normally would rather than irrigating

694
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,558
all the way up until the lights turn off

695
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,319
or even when the lights are off which

696
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,240
some people do which is basically

697
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,099
keeping that Medium wet enough that that

698
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,099
plant's like I have everything I need

699
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:31,439
I'm healthy I'm good and it doesn't get

700
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,000
that kind of kick in the butt to say oh

701
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,038
man I need to start going I need to

702
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,480
start really producing you know what's

703
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:37,679
what's ultimately going to be my

704
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,360
survival

705
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,860
gotcha I have to play around with

706
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,240
drought stress a little bit more the

707
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,178
tough thing is is like when you're

708
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,339
growing with Organics for example it's

709
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,200
often advised to keep the media moist at

710
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,538
all times because the amendments there

711
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,400
need to be broken down by microbes right

712
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,919
then microbes need to be active if it's

713
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,960
dry they're not there breaking down that

714
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
organic matter and turning them into

715
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,460
usable nutrients for the plants but on

716
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,720
the mineral nutrient side yeah I mean I

717
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,940
used to actually do that all the time

718
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,220
now that I think about it is when I

719
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,860
water right so anytime I water you do

720
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,259
the old uh stick your thumb down in the

721
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,359
medium and if the top inches bone dry

722
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,879
then you know the water right so maybe

723
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,319
that's a form of drought stress that is

724
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,419
uh actually helping with some of those

725
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,500
secondary metabolites for example so

726
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,620
I'll have to play around with a little

727
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,000
bit more yeah yeah and I mean we're not

728
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,099
talking about dragging the medium out to

729
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,159
where leaves are uh you know folding

730
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:34,740
down right I mean it's uh drought stress

731
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,778
can be you know just letting the cut the

732
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,519
the medium dry out a little bit more

733
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,798
than you usually do and you know not to

734
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,418
where it's affecting microbial life

735
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,220
um you know but but to where it's you

736
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,720
know telling the plant hey you know you

737
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,399
might not be getting water again for a

738
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,880
while like you better go kind of a thing

739
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:52,259
and you know that's a good point is um

740
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,059
you know one of the things that I want

741
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:56,759
to stress the most

742
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:58,980
about just the overall cultivation

743
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,579
experiences that most plant medicines

744
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,940
rely hugely on momentum right momentum

745
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:08,038
is so big for having those perfect

746
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,100
harvests with the most weight and the

747
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,200
best quality and that momentum can be

748
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,240
thrown off in a lot of ways you know

749
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,860
either you rooted your clones and you

750
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,899
were a week late to getting them into

751
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:21,599
you know whatever medium you are using

752
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:24,658
or you were late to transplant into a

753
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,099
bigger pot or they dry it out too much

754
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,159
to the point where they were wilting

755
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:31,079
right all of those things will stop that

756
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,960
momentum of a plant and just one event

757
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,658
like that will have a huge impact on

758
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,038
your final Harvest and so really you

759
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,380
want to make sure that from the time

760
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,359
that cutting roots or that seed Pops

761
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,360
that you have momentum through the

762
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,038
entire process I found that that's one

763
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,798
of the biggest things that will lead to

764
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,259
a decreased yield is some kind of stress

765
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:53,879
event somewhere along or a large stress

766
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,679
event I should say

767
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,659
um you know that that ends up taking the

768
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,580
momentum out of the plan

769
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:02,340
that makes sense let's flip it up let's

770
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:04,139
talk about environment so let's start

771
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:06,178
with temperature what temperature do you

772
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,580
typically aim for yeah

773
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,798
um indoors I mean you know the setting

774
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,538
uh has a lot to do with it you know

775
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,740
where you live and everything else um

776
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:15,778
you know I think for home Growers

777
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,980
temperature and humidity are obviously

778
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:18,778
two of the things that are the hardest

779
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,519
to control

780
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:23,398
um you know in small settings but you

781
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,679
know I'm usually aiming for about 82 is

782
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:27,479
kind of my comfort zone

783
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
um you know all the way up to you know

784
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,000
maybe 85. um you know I know people that

785
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,898
run their rooms even hotter than that

786
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,519
um which you know it's just

787
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,319
uncomfortable to work in I don't think

788
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,759
it's really that great uh you know for

789
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,599
the plants

790
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,759
um and uh anything lower than that

791
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,819
um you know old school HBS days we you

792
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,460
know 76 to 78 um but that was before we

793
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:52,500
had BPD and all that kind of jazz uh

794
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,460
happening so you know 82 is my sweet

795
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,380
spot

796
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,019
um but again you know adjusting

797
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,760
temperature if you can't get humidity up

798
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:02,220
that high is a good thing to do I mean

799
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,419
really when you look at temperature you

800
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,360
really want to be looking at temperature

801
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,240
and humidity combined for that VPD

802
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,879
measurement uh and staying within a

803
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,099
healthy healthy dpd range if if at all

804
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,360
possible you know um you know some of

805
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,579
these humidity levels that we're

806
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,859
starting to talk about these days you

807
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,240
know tell that to an old school grower

808
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,240
20 years ago and they think you're

809
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,339
insane right I mean 82 degrees I think

810
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,620
proper BPD in that range is 72 74 ish

811
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:33,359
percent humidity and all you know oh

812
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,398
girl be like you're crazy that's like

813
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,959
powdery mildew right

814
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:38,939
um but it's not I mean that's where

815
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,278
stomata are breathing healthy that's

816
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,980
where the plant is healthy and powdery

817
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:47,240
mildew attack unhealthy plants it's not

818
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,278
humidity that causes it humidity can

819
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,558
exacerbate it uh you know I mean uh you

820
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,298
know sport production uh or reproduction

821
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,278
happens at high humidities but that's

822
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,798
not what the cause of powdery mildew is

823
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:00,659
uh it's actually an unhealthy plant in

824
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,099
an unhealthy plant is a plant that's not

825
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,140
breeding correctly so it's really about

826
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,538
keeping those stomata open and

827
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,179
functioning and breathing and so really

828
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:10,440
it boils down to VPD now my next

829
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,298
question for you is what relative

830
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,179
humidity do you aim for and you've

831
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:18,000
answered that uh so at 81 degrees

832
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:20,220
Fahrenheit temperature it's around 70

833
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,398
percent relative humidity is that what

834
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,700
you mentioned yeah I think I think at 82

835
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,859
I think it's 72 to 74 I think is this is

836
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,019
the safe range is that for the entire

837
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:33,359
grow or is that only for veg and then

838
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,519
you kind of lower for flour yeah so I

839
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,678
mean you know typically in veg is when

840
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,538
you will see the higher uh humidity

841
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,240
ranges and a lot of people do kind of

842
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,398
pull back um for flour and honestly even

843
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,778
in late flour I'll pull that back even

844
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,298
further

845
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:51,000
um you know when you have huge you know

846
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,740
swollen flowers uh you know I always

847
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,440
kind of get a little bit gun shy keeping

848
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,599
my humidity so you know is where I'd be

849
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,480
at 7274 during veg I'd probably pull

850
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,278
that down to like 65 68 during flower

851
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,640
and then I'd probably pull that down

852
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:08,159
even further to like 60 62 during those

853
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,538
like last couple weeks of flour just so

854
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,919
I can make sure that I don't have any

855
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,259
other problems

856
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,759
uh you know like Bud rot or anything

857
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,839
like that

858
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:19,379
um so

859
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,298
gotcha and uh CO2 I know you mentioned

860
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,240
that you supplement CO2 how do you

861
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:27,058
supplement CO2 and then what level PPM

862
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,220
do you typically aim for yeah so CO2

863
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:32,398
again it all has to do with the other

864
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,298
variables light levels uh you know EC I

865
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,639
mean all of these things are

866
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,619
interconnected as you're seeing that

867
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,259
that's kind of my theme

868
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:43,439
um and so with CO2 I mean the easiest

869
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,640
way to augment CO2 is probably a CO2

870
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,460
burner

871
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,059
um it's uh it's you know lugging tanks

872
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,220
in and out of your house uh isn't uh

873
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:55,139
very discreet for one

874
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,298
um and uh it's also a pain in the butt

875
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,038
like Lena lugging the tanks to the Hydra

876
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,740
store and the gas store to get them

877
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,898
filled and so a CO2 burner is probably

878
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,538
the easiest way uh I think appropriate

879
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,459
pain lasts pretty long but you do have

880
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:11,700
to deal with the excess heat coming off

881
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,259
of a CO2 burner and they might not be

882
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,538
proactive but coal for smaller

883
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,419
applications I mean you know CO2 burner

884
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:19,798
for a room room four to ten lights is

885
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,100
probably practical and so that's how

886
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:27,658
I've always done it I've always ran in

887
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:29,759
the like 1200 to 1500 PPM range and that

888
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:32,100
seems to work for me I've heard of

889
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,879
people going all the way up to like 2500

890
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:38,639
PPM which is pretty crazy it's a lot and

891
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,320
it's a lot of CO2 and I've heard you

892
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,659
know people having great results with as

893
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,480
little as like 800. I mean I think

894
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,659
ambient CO2 is somewhere in the 400 to

895
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,120
450 range you know so for someone like

896
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,799
you who's not augmenting CO2 you know

897
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,959
refreshing that room to get that ambient

898
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,259
CO2 back to levels is super important

899
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,480
but I've had great success even at 800.

900
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,000
so I've been playing around a little bit

901
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,159
with supplementing CO2 like I got those

902
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,898
TB Naturals canisters they sent me over

903
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,480
those I tried those out for a while can

904
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:11,719
be very expensive using those I am

905
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,119
currently trying out the mushroom bags

906
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:18,059
365 exhale bags and I have that hanging

907
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,338
above the plants and uh it I do have a

908
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:22,799
CO2 monitor in there so monitoring the

909
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,858
PPM that does raise it but it's not

910
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,200
constant and the way I have my exhaust

911
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,940
set up is it's AC Infinity so it's kind

912
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,799
of automated so once I have the set

913
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,659
point set so when it reaches 82 degrees

914
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,519
Fahrenheit I aim for the same

915
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,378
temperature you do it'll start

916
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,418
exhausting out some of that heat and it

917
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:41,639
will take some of that CO2 with it so

918
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,338
that's the unfortunate thing about it

919
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,599
but uh but I figured I'd you know try it

920
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:48,659
out and see what happens and it does

921
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,399
raise up the CO2 quite a bit so yeah I

922
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,378
mean I think whenever you don't have you

923
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,000
know tanks or a CO2 burner I mean any

924
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:56,159
kind of augmentation that you can get in

925
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,599
there is better uh you know and the

926
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,858
mushroom bags are awesome I mean

927
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,800
mushrooms I think are probably going to

928
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:04,019
save our world at some point uh so um I

929
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,240
I wholeheartedly support those and uh

930
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,039
yeah I mean you know anything you can do

931
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,259
to get those levels up the better now

932
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,420
how about air circulation and air

933
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,820
exchange both of those things are very

934
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,659
important what do you do for that and do

935
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:22,500
you use that for precision stress at all

936
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:25,199
yeah I mean you know air circulation is

937
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,719
probably one of the more underrated uh

938
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,639
and underutilized uh you know theories

939
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,078
in a grow room

940
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,480
um you know getting proper air

941
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,800
circulation in a grower room is a

942
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,880
challenge

943
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,980
um you know a lot of people have

944
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,160
circulation fans that kind of just blow

945
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,838
at their plants uh and you know move air

946
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,179
around a little bit around that you know

947
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,380
immediate vicinity but really what

948
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:48,179
you're trying to do is get as much

949
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,460
turbulation in that room as possible so

950
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,500
that you're getting air through the

951
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,480
canopy and not just blowing at the

952
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,219
canopy right you know a lot of those

953
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,260
crevices where all those leaves are kind

954
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:59,879
of in close proximity you know the

955
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,920
humidity levels within those little

956
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,240
pockets can be actually a lot higher

957
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,280
than what your sensor is actually

958
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,959
telling you so getting air movement

959
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,180
through that whole entire canopy is

960
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,460
super super important

961
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:14,399
um and uh you know it's in terms of

962
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,440
stress yeah I mean blowing wind on those

963
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,139
plants is just like blowing wind in

964
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,079
nature it's going to tell that plant a

965
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,338
you need to produce stockier stems you

966
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,720
know to support

967
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:27,358
um you know the wind that you're getting

968
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,799
so you can't have light stress on the

969
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,159
plant that actually makes it sturdier

970
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,079
through air circulation uh and then in

971
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,358
your case right turning over that air

972
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,519
and backing that air out of the room so

973
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:41,279
that you get ambient CO2 to be

974
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,920
replenished uh is super important right

975
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,720
stale air is never a good thing when

976
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,159
you're doing CO2 augmentations a little

977
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,078
bit different of an equation because

978
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,358
you're trying to actually keep that

979
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,820
atmosphere in the room keep those really

980
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,559
high levels of CO2 because you know

981
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,660
again it's either coming from a tank or

982
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,420
it's coming from a burner so it makes no

983
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:02,819
sense to pull that out of the room but I

984
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,099
would still do probably every 24 hours a

985
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,599
full room refresh just to kind of pull

986
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,059
the staliness out of the air get

987
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,680
everything cycled and then turn you know

988
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:14,460
the exhaust system off and kind of get

989
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:17,219
back to you know the ico2 environment so

990
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,539
yeah airflow is very underrated in Grow

991
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:21,358
rooms and I think you know a lot of

992
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:24,239
problems end up getting caused by lack

993
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,460
of airflow I completely agree with you

994
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,919
that the air circulation is underrated

995
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,199
and you know air exchange as well I'm

996
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,260
actually doing a grill right now where

997
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,299
I have one plant that is just covered in

998
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,339
trichomes and it's right next to the fan

999
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,019
and then the other one same cultivar

1000
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:42,659
different phenotypes so I can't it's not

1001
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:44,820
really a fair comparison but the one

1002
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:47,639
directly next to the fan is just covered

1003
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,660
in the trichomes and there's that theory

1004
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:53,639
of wind stress right is that wind stress

1005
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:55,559
actually causing it to produce more

1006
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:58,319
track homes hard to prove I don't think

1007
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,179
anybody's ever proven that yet but uh

1008
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,039
but that's something that that is often

1009
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:03,358
said that can help cause Precision

1010
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,820
stress you know and help help that

1011
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,739
secondary metabolites yeah

1012
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,059
I mean yeah exactly I mean that's what

1013
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,219
it all boils down to right it's a

1014
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:13,380
secondary metabolites anytime a plant is

1015
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:15,959
stressed it says you know I mean what

1016
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,920
secondary metabolites are you know there

1017
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,260
for the plant to attract insects uh you

1018
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,119
know make more uh seed stock I mean all

1019
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,099
of the things that you know are kind of

1020
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,500
like it's survival tactics anytime you

1021
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,900
introduce stress that's what it starts

1022
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,000
to kick into high gears all of those

1023
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,039
things that it needs to you know

1024
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,900
basically survive

1025
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,358
um and so wind stress probably can

1026
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,579
absolutely do that uh you know and then

1027
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,159
you know really if one plant has better

1028
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,720
air circulation around it throughout its

1029
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,000
growing cycle than some of the plants

1030
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,578
behind it it could just have a more

1031
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,400
healthy base and be a healthier plant in

1032
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:55,619
general allowing it to you know be

1033
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,720
better quality when it's done right I

1034
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,880
mean you need a healthy plant in order

1035
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,379
to take the stresses that we give them

1036
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,480
if you don't have a healthy plant you

1037
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,160
give it stress it's gonna it's it's

1038
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,559
gonna go south on you right it's going

1039
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,420
to lock out it's gonna you know be a

1040
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,159
weak Harvest if you have a healthy plant

1041
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,900
and then you bring those stresses in

1042
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,279
it's going to have you know a good

1043
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,780
effect which is that plant's going to be

1044
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,640
like well now I'm kicking all these

1045
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,800
processes into high gear secondary

1046
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,838
metabolites seed production all that

1047
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,519
stuff well calyx production that's a

1048
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,099
really really good point there so I

1049
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,358
don't think we could talk about biomass

1050
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,280
increasing yield and stuff without

1051
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,799
talking about plant training you know

1052
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,780
that's uh often done manipulating a

1053
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,280
plant different ways doing training

1054
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,480
whether it be a low stress training high

1055
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,579
stress training there are so many

1056
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,320
different things that you can do what do

1057
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,099
you typically do for plant training in

1058
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,079
order to maximize yield or quality

1059
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,000
yeah I mean I think you know when you

1060
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,579
when you talk about uh you know plant

1061
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,760
training I don't know I mean obviously

1062
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,039
yield is a huge one right uh you can

1063
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,839
train a plant these five different ways

1064
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,659
and get five different results in terms

1065
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,719
of yield so you know where that

1066
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,118
technique comes in I think is when you

1067
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,219
are limited in your plant numbers that

1068
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,720
you can grow right I mean here in

1069
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:12,239
California

1070
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,759
um we're allowed to grow six plants uh

1071
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,279
uh you know with erect laws and so when

1072
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,720
you can only grow six plants I mean some

1073
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
of these kind of super cropping

1074
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,500
techniques are you know pinching off and

1075
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,239
you know really starting to spread out

1076
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,699
that top canopy and get a lot of

1077
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,739
different flower sites can be massive I

1078
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:31,739
mean you can quadruple your yield that

1079
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:35,759
you can get off of just four plants

1080
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:38,818
um you know in my uh in my experience

1081
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,500
it really does boil down to the strain

1082
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:42,960
that you're growing

1083
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,480
um some strains just don't take to that

1084
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,460
kind of stress as well as others I've

1085
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,260
seen certain strains that don't want to

1086
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,019
be topped they don't want to be pinched

1087
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,780
they don't want anything they do much

1088
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:57,000
better by just letting them grow letting

1089
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,800
that Apex flower happen and some of that

1090
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,659
lateral branching and that's where you

1091
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,359
get the the highest yields I've seen

1092
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:05,098
other strains that perform poorly in

1093
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,900
that in that way and they want to be

1094
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,880
topped and they want they want to have

1095
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,099
you know multiple lateral Branch sides

1096
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,980
so I do think that that's uh you know

1097
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:15,780
can be strain specific

1098
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,659
um you know but for my style of growing

1099
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm usually you know want to be as low

1100
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,338
maintenance as possible so I don't get

1101
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,680
over crazy with my training techniques

1102
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,380
or anything like that

1103
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,239
um you know and so I usually top once if

1104
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,980
it's a strain that allows that and I

1105
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,479
kind of just let them go

1106
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,280
um I usually flip into flour at a pretty

1107
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,480
young age so I'm not doing a ton of you

1108
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,119
know stress training or anything like

1109
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,980
that you know in terms of um you know

1110
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,780
Leaf stripping

1111
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,240
um you know the the week before flower

1112
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,760
leaves dripping the three week Leaf

1113
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,818
stripping I mean again that's that's all

1114
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,160
those are all those little signs of the

1115
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:55,318
plant saying wow I just lost all this

1116
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:58,019
foliage I need to kick into overdrive

1117
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,460
right I need to kick into overdrive my

1118
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,838
you know you could make the argument

1119
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,338
that you're now getting light further

1120
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,619
down into the canopy because some of

1121
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,659
those leaves are you know not existing I

1122
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,640
don't know if I buy into that as much

1123
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,739
but when you're stripping the plant of

1124
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,539
everything it's like man I need to go I

1125
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,159
need to start you know reproducing all

1126
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,039
those leaves so I can get back to having

1127
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,899
my you know my my light pads and you

1128
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,838
know I need to start you know hyper you

1129
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,639
know going into flower overdrive and so

1130
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,460
all of those things are basically

1131
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,440
telling the plant like hey you need you

1132
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,400
need to get you need to get on it you

1133
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,659
know

1134
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,980
um and so I do think that there's a lot

1135
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:34,940
of those techniques that can lead to

1136
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,219
much larger harvests taking a step back

1137
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,800
and thinking about everything that has

1138
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:43,019
to do with growing what other advice do

1139
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,019
you have for those who are looking to

1140
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:48,139
maximize yield and or quality

1141
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,139
um

1142
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,180
don't overthink it you know I think I

1143
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,579
think largely people tend to overthink

1144
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:01,799
the growing and you know they they try

1145
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,000
to get almost a little bit too nitpicky

1146
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,760
on it

1147
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,159
um you know it's something that you know

1148
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,780
I think that you need to again use your

1149
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,000
intuition

1150
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,040
um and you need to kind of pay attention

1151
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,838
to what the plants are saying you know

1152
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:18,000
pay attention to the little signals that

1153
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,519
they're giving you uh you know and and

1154
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,519
adjust uh accordingly

1155
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,338
um you know again you do in order to use

1156
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,119
some of these stress techniques you do

1157
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:32,880
have to have a healthy base first right

1158
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,318
and that has that goes back to uh you

1159
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,619
know what we've been talking about which

1160
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:41,400
is you know the correct balance between

1161
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:44,460
lighting CO2 EC and water content and

1162
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,300
CO2 you know if you have all of those

1163
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:50,338
things in Harmony and working together

1164
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:53,579
then you can go in to do all of those

1165
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:55,858
little stress techniques with UV

1166
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:58,380
um you know with water suppression with

1167
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,059
you know stripping of leaves uh at week

1168
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,280
three of flower like all those little

1169
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:04,199
things with the the plant will react

1170
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,819
great because it's now in a healthy

1171
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,519
state where it's like I can handle that

1172
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:11,420
stress and here's the production that

1173
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm going to put out as a result of it

1174
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,358
if you don't have a healthy base to

1175
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,339
start with you're just going to ruin

1176
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,679
your Harvest you know you're gonna

1177
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:22,199
you're basically gonna you know you're

1178
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,699
gonna throw the plant over the edge and

1179
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:25,759
you're going to have decreased yields

1180
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,960
and you're going to have poor quality

1181
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,000
and so you know it's really

1182
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,639
concentrating on getting that healthy

1183
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,280
base first then starting to incorporate

1184
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,440
some of those stress techniques uh is is

1185
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,000
really probably what I would say

1186
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,338
I think that's some really good advice

1187
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,019
there so wrapping things up how can

1188
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:45,299
listeners find you and what do you have

1189
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:47,219
upcoming in the future yeah

1190
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,420
um so you know you can find me on

1191
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:50,818
basically

1192
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,159
um all of our YouTube channels uh grow

1193
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:55,739
strong Industries Gorilla Grow kind LED

1194
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,239
grow lights Lotus nutrients uh and super

1195
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:58,799
products

1196
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,059
um or super closet

1197
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,640
um all have their individual social

1198
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,139
channels um all have individual YouTube

1199
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,440
channels we're trying to consolidate

1200
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:09,059
everything onto grow strong Industries

1201
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,159
um you know and we've got some great

1202
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:12,960
products uh you know in the pipeline

1203
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,239
coming out probably none of which I'm at

1204
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,559
Liberty to talk about quite yet

1205
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,118
um you know but if you keep an eye on

1206
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,920
our websites

1207
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,200
um then you'll be seeing them come out

1208
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,880
here soon and uh we're just going to

1209
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,699
continue doing what we've always done

1210
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,740
you know which is try to you know make

1211
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:31,739
world-class products that answer to

1212
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:34,379
those pain points that Growers have

1213
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:37,199
and uh continue making it easier and

1214
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:40,039
easier for people to have access to

1215
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,899
plant medicine and to grow their own

1216
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,358
because you know it's not only fun but

1217
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,099
it's you know super rewarding

1218
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,318
um and at the end of the day everybody

1219
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,359
should be able to to do that you know

1220
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:53,400
everybody should be able to grow their

1221
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,900
own plant medicine and the vegetables

1222
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,720
that they put on their table for dinner

1223
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:00,000
I think it's super important I think as

1224
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,879
a Humanity we need to get back to our

1225
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
connection with nature and it's a great

1226
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,680
way to do it you know watching that

1227
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,180
plant go through all of its processes

1228
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,679
and you know it's a labor of love being

1229
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,899
able to see it go through those

1230
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,699
processes and harvest it and consume it

1231
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,400
it's uh there's nothing there's nothing

1232
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:20,098
like it and so you know helping people

1233
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,579
kind of get back to that uh is is our

1234
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:25,680
main goal nice nice yeah I saw her on

1235
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:28,140
social media recently you guys announced

1236
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,179
a like was it like a signature grow tent

1237
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:32,460
with like Tommy Chong or something like

1238
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:35,098
that that's that's pretty cool that just

1239
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,679
launched yeah yeah

1240
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,420
it did it just launched it's been a

1241
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,399
little while in the making

1242
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,200
um but uh Tommy's team reached out to us

1243
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,599
and wanted to partner on a grow tent I

1244
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,000
was like absolutely you know obviously

1245
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,700
you know Tommy Chong has been an

1246
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,559
integral part of this industry

1247
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:54,000
um you know he's been a Pioneer in a lot

1248
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,159
of ways

1249
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,719

1250
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,318
for that same thing you know accident

1251

people having uh you know free access to

1252
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,039
plant medicine and so you know we've

1253
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:07,139
always supported Tommy and his uh his

1254
