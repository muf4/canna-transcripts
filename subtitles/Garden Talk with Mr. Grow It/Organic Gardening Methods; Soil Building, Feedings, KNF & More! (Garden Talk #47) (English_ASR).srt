1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,278
coming up on garden talk it can

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,839
strengthen anything from trichomes to

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,839
stems to your leafs it strengthens

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
everything on your plant i'm not gonna

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,919
lie i always follow the directions on

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,719
the packaging it's a good baseline when

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,359
it's an already mixed inert soil i mean

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:22,640
it's really rare for something to be too

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,640
hot to handle a seedling or a clone or

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
really anything i just open up the lid

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,399
there'll be condensation there'll be

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,320
moisture and you put your hand in the

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,238
soil it's actually gonna be warm that's

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,238
still cooking you gotta wait another

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,000
week it's worth every dollar i highly

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,878
suggest if you guys are into organic

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,439
growing in any capacity indoor outdoor

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,479
grab one of those i would rather that it

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,159
got disturbed and replenished then

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,398
nothing happening at all it's always a

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,959
better option doing nothing is never the

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,960
right idea

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039

91
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,000
introduction so can you tell us a little

92
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,439
bit about yourself and kind of how you

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
got into gardening

94
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,000
yeah my name's uh green lantern or jacob

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,878
uh is my real name

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
and i got into gardening a long while

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,878
back just as uh something fun to do

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,720
really i really enjoyed the medicinal

99
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,798
properties of the medical plants and uh

100
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,799
at first it was just because it was fun

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,840
and then you know years later i had a

102
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,799
lot of back issues uh happen i had a car

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,799
accidents and i was overweight

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,719
back got all messed up and

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
formed an s in my spine and they call

106
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,438
that sublaxation scoliosis

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
and then i started using it medicinally

108
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,519
and then i got way more interested in it

109
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:01,119
started doing crazy amounts of research

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,400
with uh green goblin and you know

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,158
now we're here

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,438
that's awesome yeah green goblin is you

113
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,519
know he's been on the channel before and

114
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,359
people loved that episode we had had

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,039
with him because he was just spitting

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
off a ton of knowledge when it comes to

117
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,878
organics and you're right there by a

118
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,879
side you know growing in the same garden

119
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,959
so we're gonna hear a lot of good

120
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,199
techniques today and yeah let's start

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
with mixing soil because i know you have

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,759
a lot of good information about

123
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
mixing soil in particular so talk to us

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
what's in your mix

125
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,439
and how do you mix it

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
so uh our mix has kind of been building

127
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,160
over almost a decade now so it

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,199
originally it started off with maybe a

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,759
few pro mix bales from back in the day

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
uh and then we started adding you know

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
everything that one would need to add to

132
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,240
build a soil uh we got sphagnum peat

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,600
moss we started doing large pieces of

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
perlite and then we switched to uh

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
high porosity clay

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
pellets in

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
uh

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,639
rice holes and uh

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
you know just we just started messing

140
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,879
around with different blends and i mean

141
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,279
at at this point right now i'd say

142
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,800
everything in there is

143
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,559
sphagnum

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,439
the clay pellets

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
and

146
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,199
uh compost that's pretty that's pretty

147
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
much it

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,280
what's the ratios of each and you talk

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
about clay pellets it's something that

150
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,599
we don't really hear people using much

151
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,038
can you talk to us about why the clay

152
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,199
pellets and then also the kind of the

153
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,680
ratios of each of the things that you

154
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,439
have in there yeah we're doing like a 30

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,038
20 uh

156
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,519
30 20 20 mix i would say uh you know 30

157
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,478
sphagnum meat peat moss 20

158
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,560
uh manure uh compost manures

159
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,879
uh and 20

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,519
others which might be you know your rice

161
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,918
halls and your uh clay pellets things

162
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,478
like that we we started doing rice holes

163
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,519
a while back because they add a lot of

164
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,199
benefit to the soil uh in

165
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,359
the only problem we had with that is it

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
doesn't affect drainage as much as we

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,319
wanted

168
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,759
uh and they break down pretty quickly so

169
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,680
if you're looking for something to stay

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,680
in your mix a little bit longer the clay

171
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,959
pellets will give you that advantage as

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
well as add a little bit of silica to

173
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,318
your mix which

174
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,198
helps with so many things uh j just like

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
uh

176
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,520
dr bruce was talking about on the uh

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,478
last podcast

178
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
it can strengthen anything from

179
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,439
trichomes to

180
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,359
stems to

181
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,439
your leafs i mean pretty much it

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
strengthens everything on your plant

183
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,160
and then for the compost you mentioned

184
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
you said 20 compost is there any you

185
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
have any tips in regards to that because

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
that could be

187
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,560
different types of compost right yeah

188
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,359
and honestly i suggest using whatever is

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
the

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
most readily available in your area i

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,880
prefer mushroom compost but if you can't

192
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,439
find mushroom compost uh i'm seeing

193
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,719
booze blend compost and a lot of plate

194
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,199
and a lot of uh

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
hydro shops and and grow shops in

196
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
general i've even seen it in home depot

197
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,679
before

198
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,598
and booze blend is just this is a solid

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,280
compost that

200
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,000
you don't have to worry about

201
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,399
too many things with it uh sourcing of

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
where the materials came from or

203
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,879
uh

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
maybe possibly having too much

205
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,120
background all that was sourced

206
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,159
incorrectly uh

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,160
issues

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,479
there's no issues with it that i've i've

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
i've personally come across with it so

210
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,719
if i see booze blend i'll probably grab

211
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,439
that if i see mushroom compost somewhere

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
i would i would 100 much much rather get

213
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,199
the mushroom compost

214
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:45,198
okay so you have your 30 20 20

215
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
and then are you adding any additional

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,000
amendments in there like some people

217
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,800
will do blends right so build a soil is

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,800
infamous for their craft blend we've got

219
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,598
green sunshine company they have earth

220
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
dust nutrients and they have a mixture

221
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,199
that you initially blend in

222
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
with your initial mix do you do any

223
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
additional amendments on top of what you

224
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,519
had just mentioned

225
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,560
yes um what uh me and gr what me and

226
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,318
green goblin usually do there is

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
build a soil craft blend like you're

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,280
saying

229
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
if that's not around we'll use a dr

230
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,359
earth blend

231
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,918
pretty much same same idea same stuffs

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160
in it different name brand

233
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,439
you can find it at home depot and some

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,479
hydro shops around uh i prefer the craft

235
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,120
blend

236
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,838
it has a couple different ingredients in

237
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,759
it

238
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,200
and in different ratios

239
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,200
uh that are more preferable for

240
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,959
organic growing in my opinion

241
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
but if you're in a pinch and that's the

242
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,599
stuff that's around it's going to do

243
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,639
great

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,440
uh but i i prefer to use the craft blend

245
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,879
and we use uh

246
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,399
i gotta change the measurements in my

247
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,958
head now because we switched the way we

248
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
mix our soil it's like seven gallons

249
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,239
that fits in the

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,919
mixer rather

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,560
so it's like two and a half cups of that

252
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,479
mix and then we'll add some frass

253
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:11,039
sometimes or uh silica uh if we if we

254
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,000
notice that the last round had issues

255
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,799
with

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
uh

257
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,958
nitrogen we'll add more compost we'll

258
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
add

259
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,039
it depends on what's going on with the

260
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,159
last cycle

261
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,000
okay so as far as like ratios specific

262
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,919
ratios i know we have a lot of uh folks

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,958
that are tuning in that you know more on

264
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,639
the beginner side they will kind of want

265
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,119
to know the nitty gritty details about

266
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,600
the exact ratios i personally use about

267
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,240
one cup per plant for the build a soil

268
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
craft blend that's pretty accurate

269
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
i think that's what it says on their

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,000
instructions on their website i think

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
it's a third cup to one cup per plant

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,919
are you also like the doctor earth and

273
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
stuff like that are you following the

274
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,000
direct the directions that they say on

275
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
the packaging or are you doing something

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
completely different

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,720
i'm not gonna lie i always follow

278
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,519
directions on the packaging it's a good

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
baseline either it's gonna be maybe a

280
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,759
little bit too much or maybe a little

281
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
bit too less but if you start with that

282
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,679
baseline in the instructions that

283
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,759
they've given you it's going to be

284
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,519
generally right around where you want it

285
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,958
and then you can adjust from there based

286
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
off from your needs

287
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,759
uh maybe

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,959
maybe your particular cultivars of said

289
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,519
strain

290
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,278
really just need way more nitrogen than

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,759
other other strains that you've had or

292
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,399
they need way more potassium or or

293
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,120
whatever's going on then you can start

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,000
minutely changing a few different things

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,799
uh in amounts of ingredients that you

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
use

297
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,159
to mitigate those things for maybe the

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
next round or even top dressing on your

299
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,639
current point current round of medicinal

300
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
plants or any plants

301
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,958
to

302
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,200
get the desired result out of it got it

303
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,119
that makes sense yeah i've been using

304
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,278
you mentioned insect fast i've used that

305
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,759
in the past also alfalfa meal is another

306
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,919
thing i've used so often times i start

307
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,399
off with the bag soil you know fox from

308
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,639
ocean forest oil is is local to me as

309
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,639
far as i'm able to pick it up locally so

310
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,078
i go with that but i'll start with the

311
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,240
foxpro motion for soil and there's

312
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,639
actually been times where i mixed in

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,879
insect frass and alfalfa meal into the

314
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,480
ocean forest and i got a lot of people

315
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,720
raising their eyebrows there like ocean

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399
forest it's already too hot you should

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,600
never be adding anything more than that

318
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,039
you're burning your seedlings you're

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,278
ruining your plants blah blah blah blah

320
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,439
blah but i actually got a really good

321
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,200
result you know i started in one gallon

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
containers fox from ocean forest oil

323
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
we'll put some insect frost in there an

324
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,879
alfalfa meal i got some really really

325
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,639
good results off of that first

326
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,399
vegetation stage in the beginning there

327
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,720
obviously the nutrients deplete over

328
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
time and had to top dress in add more

329
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,639
nutrients in which actually we're going

330
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,639
to get into that next here yeah and i

331
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,039
think people get a little confused with

332
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,278
this terminology of a of a soil blend

333
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,480
maybe possibly being too hot

334
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,480
uh in reality if the blend has already

335
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,120
been mixed and it's in a bag like fox

336
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,039
farm that's an inert mix it's it's been

337
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,360
mixed already um

338
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,519
the hotness that we're referring to

339
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
in a hot mix is is literally a

340
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,200
temperature it's

341
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,480
you can feel it you'll reach your hand

342
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,879
into the uh uh your soil mix and it's

343
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,039
20 30 40 degrees warmer

344
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,078
uh and if you do this in a tent out in

345
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,480
the backyard or a tarp rather out in the

346
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,479
backyard in the winter you'll see actual

347
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,079
steam coming off from this it's it's

348
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,600
that's what we're talking about when we

349
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,519
say uh we gotta cook this soil mix

350
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,200
it's literally cooking and if you were

351
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,839
to use that soil during that process

352
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
that mix is literally too hot it's

353
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
physically too hot and nutriently too

354
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,240
hot

355
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,240
and everything is just bioactively

356
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
readily available so as soon as you

357
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
plant a

358
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
seed into something like that or a clone

359
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
into something like that you're

360
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
definitely gonna have problems

361
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,679
but when you when it's an already mixed

362
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,078
inert soil

363
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,159
that i mean it's really rare for

364
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,519
something to be too hot

365
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:10,240
to handle a seedling or a

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,039
clone or really anything got it so when

367
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,519
you when you do that initial mixing that

368
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,078
you mentioned you're letting it cook for

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,120
a little while right so what time period

370
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,759
are you letting how long are you letting

371
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,240
this cook for so if you're doing it in

372
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,838
batches of about 30 gallons which i

373
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,639
would recommend if you're going to mix a

374
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,320
soil do at least 30 gallons because

375
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,240
you're gonna use it you're gonna love it

376
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
and you're gonna have to make more for

377
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,879
about 30 gallons a cook time with a good

378
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,120
cook time would be about two weeks uh

379
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,480
and a good way to check this is you know

380
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,198
a week in

381
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,560
open up uh if it's in a i use trash cans

382
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,759
i use 35 gallon trash cans uh

383
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,759
heavy duty

384
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,559
if i just open up the lid there will be

385
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,399
condensation there'll be moisture and

386
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,719
you put your hand in the soil it's

387
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
actually going to be warm that's still

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,480
cooking you got to wait another week

389
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,959
typically two weeks is perfect

390
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,680
if it is going past two weeks you

391
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,879
probably did mix it a little too hot in

392
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,799
which case i would take that one and mix

393
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,639
it with another one

394
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,919
another trash can that i'd already

395
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,839
pre-mixed that's a little less hot

396
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,838
and then you got like a diluted version

397
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,600
of that original mix

398
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,279
that's still going to be plenty potent

399
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,199
enough to do whatever you want in

400
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,799
vegetative or

401
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,240
flowering stage

402
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,759
so you're holding off until the

403
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,799
temperature kind of goes down do you

404
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,360
know what temperature would be too hot

405
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,198
by chance like are people taking like a

406
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,039
temperature gun and like putting it on

407
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,198
their pile and then saying oh okay this

408
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,278
is low enough i would recommend that

409
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,879
actually because during the exothermic

410
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,838
reaction you could get anywhere up to

411
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,600
like 130 degrees fahrenheit which is

412
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
very warm like

413
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,800
that's why i like to use heavy duty

414
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,399
trash cans because

415
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,240
it can get a little out of control

416
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,919
sometimes with the amount of heat that

417
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,759
these things can produce

418
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,240
and also if you have the if you're doing

419
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,198
this in your area where you have your

420
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,799
grow

421
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,240
keep that in mind as well because it may

422
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,599
actually increase the temperature of

423
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,839
that room

424
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,440
which you may may or may not want at

425
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,199
that time

426
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
uh but i would i would definitely do a

427
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,319
temperature or i i don't i don't use

428
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,838
temperature guns because

429
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,800
it's so much faster for me to reach my

430
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
hand in uh if it's fiz if the dirt is

431
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,319
our soil is physically warmer than the

432
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,000
air

433
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
that's kind of that's kind of a good

434
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,919
sign that it's still working on some

435
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
stuff and you should wait a little bit

436
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,599
longer

437
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,679
also if you start if you start to see

438
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,959
like white mycelium forming on the top

439
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,439
of your soil

440
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,719
things are finishing out it's it's fully

441
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,839
cooked you

442
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,360
feel very safe and using that and uh you

443
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,519
can feel like you did a really well

444
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,959
really really good job because when

445
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
that's showing up you know you've got

446
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,518
the microbes and the mycorrhizal life

447
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,278
that you wanted to create in the in your

448
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
mix in the first place

449
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,439
sounds like some good general guidelines

450
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,439
there now for the

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,720
two week period that you're letting the

452
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,000
soil cook

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,000
are you going in there i know you said

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
you had a top on the container are you

455
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,919
going in there and doing like any type

456
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,639
of aeration like taking the top off once

457
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,240
a day like fanning it are you turning

458
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,480
the pile at all are you doing any of

459
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,278
that or just letting it sit uh i just

460
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,639
let it sit i do have a couple holes

461
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,439
poked in the lids of the trash cans

462
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,399
so that it can have air gas exchange

463
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
uh

464
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,198
which is it is kind of they're not super

465
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,679
air tight so you don't need to poke the

466
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,159
hole but it does help

467
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,919
okay and then before we actually started

468
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,439
recording you brought up a interesting

469
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,360
thing is a lot of people what they'll do

470
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,839
is they'll lay a tarp out and they'll

471
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
put their mixture in together right and

472
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
then they'll physically use their hands

473
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,240
to mix in things yeah you had mentioned

474
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,078
some downsides to that and then you had

475
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
mentioned something that you do instead

476
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,278
which is use a mixer can you talk to us

477
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,519
about that

478
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,198
yeah most certainly like you were saying

479
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,439
the i was doing the tarp method for

480
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,399
years and i would uh i would get a whole

481
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,558
bunch of uh expended

482
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,720
pots onto the tarp and i'd break them

483
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,399
all up and i'd put all the amendments on

484
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
there and i'd put more

485
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,679
compost on there and i just start

486
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
folding this tarp

487
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
and it's hundreds of pounds at that

488
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,798
point you got to add water and then it's

489
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,879
getting heavier

490
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,838
eventually it was just too back-breaking

491
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
uh

492
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,440
we started looking into like

493
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,639
alternatives and we found uh cement

494
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,080
mixers were amazing at mixing

495
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,759
soil

496
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,558
because they can handle

497
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,038
super heavy loads they can handle

498
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,160
wet temp wet high temperature low

499
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,160
temperature

500
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
uh everything we're like shoot we're

501
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
gonna give that a try we grabbed one

502
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
that's not very big i would maybe

503
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,000
recommend getting one just a little bit

504
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,399
bigger than i have it fits about seven

505
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,798
gallons but

506
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,960
all the work is taken out of

507
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,480
out of my hands and i'm getting a way

508
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,120
more thorough mix

509
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,798
because there's just no no possible way

510
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,399
that

511
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,000
you're going to have enough energy and

512
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,320
strength to

513
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,558
mix that much

514
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,960
as much as a concrete mixer can in that

515
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,639
amount of time so i i get to save a

516
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,519
whole bunch of time and a whole bunch of

517
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
labor

518
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,240
which is

519
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,319
a big reason why i got into organic

520
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,150
growing i'm a little lazy

521
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,240
and i like to

522
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,160
[Music]

523
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,079
take long periods where i don't have to

524
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
do a whole bunch of physical labor and

525
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,240
to take one more thing out of the line

526
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,880
of things especially

527
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,798
moving and mixing soil

528
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
shoot it's worth every dollar i highly

529
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,679
suggest if you guys are into organic

530
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,440
growing in any capacity indoor outdoor

531
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
you just want to make your own mix for

532
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
anything

533
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,639
grab one of those it'll say it'll save

534
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
your back i'm telling you how much do

535
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,080
they cost

536
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,079
ours i believe was like 300 uh it wasn't

537
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,960
super outrageous and i think that's what

538
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,639
also turned us on to it was you know

539
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,960
300 can be a lot at one point in time

540
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,759
but it's gonna save me

541
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,720
countless hours of work and maybe even a

542
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,319
few chiropractor visits

543
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
and then one of the dimensions on it i

544
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,918
don't know if you mentioned the actual

545
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,038
dimensions just so people at home if

546
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
they're wondering you know is this

547
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,160
something you can keep in your grow room

548
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
or you know is it more garage your

549
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,919
backyard type size

550
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,320
it's like a two point you can keep it in

551
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,280
your garage or in a basement very easily

552
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,200
uh the drum fits about seven gallons i

553
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,558
want to say they called it like a 3.7

554
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,319
liter because they're talking about

555
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,160
cement terms here

556
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,960
uh

557
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,120
and it's it's super easy to use it's got

558
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
elsa has is an on and off button one

559
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,959
plug

560
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
uh

561
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,798
the handle

562
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
is retracting so you just retract the

563
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,519
handle out and you dump it

564
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,599
with it on and it pushes all the dirt

565
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,639
into your container

566
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,159
and you're done and that's it it's super

567
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
duper simple

568
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,120
anybody could run one

569
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
and it just saves so much work

570
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,479
it's been a godsend yeah i'll definitely

571
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,480
have to check that out maybe i'll buy

572
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
one for the future yeah they're super

573
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,558
portable they come on on two wheels you

574
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
can you can roll them around put them in

575
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,399
the corner take it out only when you

576
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,159
need to get your job done

577
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,600
it's it's it's become a must-have in the

578
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
grow room for me

579
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,719
for sure all right so moving along so

580
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,280
they have their soil mixed up they ready

581
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,038
to plant they plant what size containers

582
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,720
do you generally recommend like i think

583
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,879
you mentioned seven gallon containers

584
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,798
are you in larger containers and then

585
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
when does that first feeding actually

586
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,240
happen

587
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,240
so i would recommend

588
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
maybe starting in a seven and moving to

589
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,279
a 15 if you're gonna want to do like a

590
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,038
midway transfer a mid mid transplant or

591
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,798
just going straight to the 15 if you

592
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,158
don't want to deal with that and add the

593
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,839
extra stressor

594
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,120
uh

595
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,199
it's

596
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,199
kind of crucial to have that surface

597
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
area in an organic

598
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,679
setting

599
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
so that you

600
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,798
so i i call them batteries they're soil

601
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,360
batteries if you got a 15 gallon soil

602
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,079
battery it's gonna have enough juice to

603
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,079
supply that plant for

604
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:17,519
all the way through the vegetative state

605
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:20,480
and maybe a few weeks into flower at

606
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,480
that point you're gonna want a top dress

607
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,839
uh

608
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
you're gonna want to start using some

609
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,199
compost teas

610
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,479
i like to use them

611
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
once a week

612
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
during like the first three to four

613
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,759
weeks of flower

614
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,599
because there's a huge

615
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,440
a huge uptake in nutrients and they're

616
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,359
shooting up sometimes

617
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,159
double their size to three times their

618
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,918
size in the flower room after the flip

619
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,039
and that takes a lot of energy it takes

620
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,679
a lot of nutrients and it's safe to say

621
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,759
that a good 60 to 70 percent of the

622
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,919
stuff that you thought was there

623
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,440
is been eaten has been eaten up by that

624
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
point in time

625
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,519
um

626
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,120
if you are doing seven gallon pots

627
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,400
uh and you just don't have the room to

628
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,599
do 15 or 10 gallon pots

629
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
it just means you got to do a couple

630
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,839
more top dressings i would top dress

631
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,918
halfway through vegetative stage

632
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,879
uh if your veg if your veg period is

633
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,880
usually

634
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,679
six weeks let's say or four weeks and

635
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
i'll do do a top dress at two weeks in

636
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,798
and then top dress right before it goes

637
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,519
in the flower

638
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,359
um and you should be pretty solid

639
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,240
okay so if you're trying to make it very

640
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,158
as easy as possible 15 gallon containers

641
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,839
literally plant in there

642
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,480
you don't have to do your first feeding

643
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,759
or top dressing until the flowering

644
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,599
stage is what you mentioned several

645
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,200
weeks into the flowering stage which is

646
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,399
awesome i've just been using these seven

647
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
gallon containers right now and i've

648
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
been doing exactly kind of what you just

649
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,839
mentioned is there are feedings within

650
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
the vegetation stage i'm doing a top

651
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,199
dressing within the vegetation stage

652
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,798
it's usually what i'll do is i'll do

653
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
about 30 days

654
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,879
then 20 to 30 days then i'll do a top

655
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
dressing and then shortly after that i'm

656
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,480
usually flipping the flower and then

657
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,200
from there i will do another top

658
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,798
dressing roughly 20 30 days into flower

659
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
and that usually gets me through the

660
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,079
grow and that's in seven gallon

661
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,360
containers but

662
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,439
you know you make me want to actually

663
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,000
switch to a larger container because

664
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,919
then i have to do less feedings right

665
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
it's worth it's worth it in the long run

666
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,759
uh and

667
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,519
it usually ends up equaling out i'm

668
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,200
always worried you know maybe if i do

669
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,158
that i i'm not going to be able to run

670
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,159
as many uh plants and and my harvest

671
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,480
isn't gonna be what it needs to be uh

672
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,320
but typically when you're running bigger

673
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,079
pots you're gonna get a bigger plant and

674
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,399
you'll get that heart that same harvest

675
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,519
that you were thinking of just with less

676
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
plants

677
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,319
and

678
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,759
it's gotten me so convinced that i'm

679
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,240
starting to think maybe i should move up

680
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,319
to 30 gallons and and do half the amount

681
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
of plants but i gotta really convince

682
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,079
goblin about that that would be a hard

683
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,559
one

684
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,038
so when you're doing the let's say let's

685
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,278
say you need to feed in veg right what

686
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,679
are you feeding in veg

687
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,240
um in in veg i really would just do a

688
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,759
light top dressing of the craft blend or

689
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
the dr earth blend that we were talking

690
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,200
about earlier

691
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,759
uh and just kind of let it do its work

692
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,919
uh water it in a little bit

693
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,558
let it let it take off if if i'm

694
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,200
noticing that that's not enough

695
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:18,000
for a certain plant then i'll probably

696
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,278
add some worm castings and a little bit

697
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,880
of compost if i've got some extra from

698
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,759
mixing soil

699
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,919
and that just kind of re it's like

700
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,079
recharge it reactivates the microbial

701
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
life and kind of gives it a kick in the

702
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,918
butt and say hey wake up and start

703
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,918
delivering nutrients to this plant and

704
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,559
then when you get into flowering are you

705
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,400
doing any different type of feeding or

706
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,240
is it the same exact thing that you just

707
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,720
mentioned that you do for veg

708
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,159
yeah same exact thing we might add a

709
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,079
little bit of what if we're doing a

710
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,080
compost tea you might add a little bit

711
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,720
of sugar i don't like to go too hard on

712
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,519
the sugar because most everything

713
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,278
uh

714
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,200
about the mix in in what you're doing

715
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,278
in organic growing is to get that

716
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,798
microbial life to

717
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:07,278
to be alive and to multiply and

718
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,599
it it can get a little too hardcore if

719
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,720
you start going crazy with molasses or

720
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,678
sugar so use i use that sparingly and

721
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,839
that's probably that's pretty much the

722
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,240
only other thing i add i'll you know

723
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,158
when i'm doing compost teas we'll do

724
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,359
the same stuff that's in the in the soil

725
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,200
mix the

726
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,119
booze compost the

727
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
little bit of little handful of craft

728
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,319
blend uh when i say handful i literally

729
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,319
mean i'll grab a handful and

730
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:36,879
that's it and i use a 30 gallon uh 35

731
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,359
gallon trash cans for everything i do it

732
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,240
keeps all the metrics the same so

733
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,519
my

734
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,839
water reservoirs 35 gallons the

735
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,918
soil batteries that i just made 35

736
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,519
gallons everything

737
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,600
adds up and i don't have to do a whole

738
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,240
bunch of math i'm thinking

739
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,798
maybe i didn't make this here t strong

740
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,960
enough there's no i don't have it i've

741
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,839
i've been doing it for so long that i've

742
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
taken a lot of the measurements out

743
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,639
and just started using

744
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
what what works for the containers that

745
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
i have because nothing

746
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,839
if the container doesn't change you know

747
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,000
exactly what you're dealing with they

748
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,278
mentioned worm castings and compost i

749
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
know microbes are going to come along

750
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,558
with that there's so many microbial

751
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,000
inoculants on the market today you also

752
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,319
mentioned recharge do you use any of the

753
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,720
micro products to inoculate the medium

754
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,599
at any point in the grow whether it be

755
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,600
you know recharge or mammoth p or any of

756
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,639
the micro products out there

757
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,240
not always uh if i have some around i

758
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,679
will i'll do it because it's a big

759
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,519
benefit it it is going to help i mean

760
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,360
there's no there's no reason not to use

761
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,359
it if you have it around if you don't

762
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,599
have it around i also wouldn't feel too

763
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,839
bad about it you can mitigate that

764
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,399
process like we were saying with

765
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,119
with your compost and your uh with your

766
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,519
manures and with your worm castings and

767
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,959
pretty much any other type of castings

768
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,639
uh

769
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,798
so i don't worry about it too much but

770
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,320
if i do have it around it's a blessing

771
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,720
i'll use it and

772
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,960
it speeds things up

773
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,558
uh you'll notice i've at least i've

774
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,558
noticed an increase in growth uh

775
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,599
in the increase in in the speed of

776
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,319
growth

777
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,398
when i use products like that

778
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,439
i wouldn't rely on them solely

779
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,199
because

780
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,558
i'm trying to get away from relying on

781
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,558
products

782
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,158
but also

783
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,558
it's great to have something to run to

784
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,120
like that it's the convenience of it is

785
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,158
amazing you also briefly talked about

786
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,239
compost teas so you do aerated compost

787
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,919
teas throughout the grow can we get

788
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,919
deeper into that a little bit i'm

789
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
wondering when you apply the compost

790
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,840
teas i know it's going to add in a lot

791
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,679
of beneficial bacteria microbes that are

792
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,759
needed to help break down those

793
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,278
amendments you know help with nutrient

794
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,440
uptake speed up growth so on and so

795
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,000
forth how often are you doing these

796
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,240
compost teas and what's your process for

797
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,200
brewing

798
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,798
so i like to do compost teas when i'm

799
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,200
noticing that the uh plant battery is

800
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,558
running out of juice and you'll you'll

801
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,679
you'll notice this with the way your

802
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,678
plants behaving it might be uh praying

803
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,278
one day then the next day you got a

804
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,120
couple yellow leaves and everything's

805
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,159
hanging down and it just the plant looks

806
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,000
sad doesn't look happening happy anymore

807
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
that's a good sign that it's time to

808
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,200
recharge up some of those microbes and

809
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,759
to do that the easiest way for a lot of

810
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,240
people including myself is a compost tea

811
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,879
i like to take a five gallon bucket with

812
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,480
two very large air stones

813
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,480
uh and i have a micron filter bag meant

814
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,880
for compost teas

815
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,720
i'll throw my ingredients in there

816
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,840
typically like a cup of booze blend a

817
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,759
handful craft mix uh

818
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,839
maybe a little bit of sugar

819
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,000
and we'll throw that we'll throw one air

820
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,879
stone in the bag and one air stone in

821
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,200
the bucket with the

822
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,600
mostly full of water you know it's 90

823
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,038
full of water and we'll leave that there

824
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,879
for 16

825
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:09,119
to 20 hours

826
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,840
i find if i go past 24 or into the 48

827
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,239
it's starting to get a little

828
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,599
too anaerobic in a sense uh for lack of

829
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,919
a better word

830
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,678
and i'd rather use it when it when it

831
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,600
has all that fresh new life that

832
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,080
just came out and it's ready to work

833
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,000
gotcha now i was going to ask you about

834
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,599
nutrient teas as well but it looks like

835
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,119
that's your you know that compost tea

836
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,480
that you mentioned you're adding in

837
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,239
nutrients right you said you're adding

838
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
in some craft blends and stuff like that

839
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,200
yeah so some of those i assume are going

840
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,519
to be water-soluble others aren't going

841
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,519
to be water soluble so do you take that

842
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,679
bag and then put it you know top dress

843
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,839
your soil with it or what do you do um i

844
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,600
use yeah honestly i'll take what's left

845
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,038
of that bag and i'll put it back into my

846
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,439
soil mix

847
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,599
and just kind of mix it back in and

848
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,480
whatever whatever's left is

849
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,719
only going to benefit that soil mix now

850
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,679
all right how about seed sprouted teas

851
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,000
do you use utilize those at all or no

852
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,480
me and goblin have not really used them

853
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,960
that much uh we have

854
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,278
tried it out you know just as a just as

855
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,840
a kind of science experiment but

856
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,640
i'm i'm pretty interested in it

857
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,158
it's kind of it's kind of more new to me

858
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,080
so

859
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,000
i'd like to try it out in a more

860
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,000
controlled setting maybe pick a tent and

861
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,240
those ones are going to get that and

862
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
everything else won't kind of thing and

863
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,480
just just see what happens

864
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,079
but no it was a it's a it's a

865
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,558
fascinating idea and i started looking

866
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,398
more into it once uh once you've brought

867
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,240
it up and

868
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,918
it's kind of it's kind of fascinating to

869
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,599
germinate a bunch of these seeds and

870
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,640
juice them up and then feed them back to

871
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,079
your

872
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,480
plants it's

873
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,839
it's a crazy idea that just might work

874
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,240
absolutely let's move on to mulch layers

875
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,278
so definitely key to use you know

876
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,038
especially when you're growing

877
00:30:57,278 --> 00:30:59,759
organically you need to make sure that

878
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,679
the

879
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,000
that top layer is moist right the soil

880
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,919
needs to be moist in order to have those

881
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
micro ups active and a mulch layer is

882
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,120
one of those things that helps retain

883
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,759
the moisture in the medium right what do

884
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,479
you use for mulch layers typically right

885
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,879
now i use straw uh

886
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,159
it's pretty easy to deal with you know

887
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,080
and it does an excellent job of trapping

888
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,159
moisture on that top layer so that

889
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,439
things don't dry out

890
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,600
but

891
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,558
it's kind of a pain in the butt in a way

892
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,398
as well

893
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:34,558
and i'm i'm

894
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,558
exploring different ideas maybe uh

895
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,440
maybe even like a

896
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,599
non-organic idea maybe something like uh

897
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,919
that those sheets that they put on

898
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,759
gardens outdoors something that's just a

899
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
little less messy because when you go

900
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,679
back to

901
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,278
[Music]

902
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,679
i need to take the

903
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,278
this soil and mix it again you've got a

904
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,278
whole bunch of straw that you've got to

905
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,278
deal with and some of it is in big

906
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,919
pieces which is awesome you can grab

907
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:03,519
that pretty easy and some of it is kind

908
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,000
of shredded or or not decaying and

909
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,079
it it becomes a problem for me because

910
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,398
i'm super ocd when it comes to mixing

911
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,519
the soil and i only want the things that

912
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,639
i put in the soil in the soil

913
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,038
but

914
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,640
it works it works excellent and besides

915
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,798
you know getting a little

916
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,759
ocd about cleanliness

917
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:26,158
it's it's probably one of the best uh

918
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,519
options for a mulch layer

919
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,159
in my opinion

920
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,159
i've been using barley straw as a mulch

921
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,159
layer as well and yeah it's pretty easy

922
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,000
to use for sure you know when i am doing

923
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,080
that top dressing i am lifting it up and

924
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,359
putting those amendments underneath the

925
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,798
layer and kind of mixing in the soil

926
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,240
underneath that layer sometimes i'm

927
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:43,918
actually removing them entirely and then

928
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,000
putting the amendments up top and mixing

929
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,759
them in and then reapplying now some

930
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,519
people would probably probably say i'm

931
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,000
disturbing the microbe life a little bit

932
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,159
by removing that layer then re-adding it

933
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,398
but they might they might i mean it

934
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,919
might be but i'm not gonna lie

935
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,518
we do the same thing

936
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,440
i like you gotta lift that up and you

937
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,399
gotta sometimes you gotta move some soil

938
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,440
around and really mix it in there uh i

939
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,599
would rather that it got disturbed

940
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,640
and replenished

941
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,639
then

942
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,120
nothing happening at all

943
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,000
ah that's always a better option

944
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,599
doing nothing is never the right idea

945
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,038
let's move on to cover crops can you

946
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,199
talk to us about cover crops a little

947
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,759
bit what you do for them

948
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,200
yeah right now we're not using any cover

949
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,200
crops uh

950
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,679
but they can be very beneficial

951
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,399
especially in determining signs of

952
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,519
deficiencies uh before the plant is

953
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,918
actually

954
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,519
being harmed uh because those cover

955
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,240
crops are going to be the first ones to

956
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,440
see see the signs of a of any type of

957
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,399
deficiency

958
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,159
uh i think it's very smart to use a wide

959
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,639
variety of cover crops i see a lot of

960
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,200
people picking one and sticking with it

961
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,240
uh and that'll just be the cover crop on

962
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,480
every plant in in every pot

963
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,640
which is convenient it's easier i'll

964
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,240
give you that much but i think if you

965
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,159
had a mixture then you could see

966
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,278
different traits of different

967
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,800
deficiencies in different ways

968
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,358
on different cover crops giving you a

969
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,679
little wider spectrum of information

970
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,838
uh

971
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,000
and more benefits because once a lot of

972
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,480
these different cover crops degrade

973
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,320
differently when they die off which

974
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,760
giving you different types of nutrients

975
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,679
and maybe

976
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
you thought that this cover crop was

977
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,280
going to give you

978
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,039
more potassium but it actually gave you

979
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,440
way too much phosphorus and now you've

980
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,279
got a really really hot phosphorus in

981
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,398
your in your mix and

982
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
you're not really sure what to do at

983
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,559
that point that that's the only worry i

984
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,719
have with cover crops

985
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,878
is just if you are going to use them

986
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,239
keep them diverse

987
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,559
that way

988
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,319
your soil is eating a whole diverse

989
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,918
palette like a buffet of different

990
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
things and that's that's all everybody

991
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,279
wants really

992
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
gotcha definitely some good advice there

993
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
for sure

994
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,440
okay so

995
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
they've mixed their soil they've grown

996
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
their plant or they're using mulch

997
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
layers and cover crops or they're not

998
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,559
they're using compost teas

999
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,639
top dressing when needed they've gone

1000
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,559
through their growth successfully

1001
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,239
what do you do with that 15 gallon

1002
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,639
container are you

1003
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,479
removing it from that container and then

1004
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,199
re-amending and then putting it back in

1005
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,199
your concrete mixer or are you

1006
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,879
keeping that container and just doing

1007
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,559
kind of like a no-till style to where

1008
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,720
you're just replanting directly into

1009
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,320
that container re-amending and so on and

1010
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,000
so forth

1011
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,760
um a good 99 of the time i'm pulling

1012
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,358
them and i'm gonna mix them with the

1013
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,000
concrete mixer

1014
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,159
if i had a rare case where i noticed

1015
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,079
that the mix was hot all the way through

1016
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,039
i didn't have to top dress in the flower

1017
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,440
stage

1018
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,320
and i wasn't doing very many compost

1019
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,480
teas

1020
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
and everything still went fine then i'm

1021
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,320
gonna take those specific uh pots and

1022
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,240
i'll replant directly in them i'll pull

1023
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,519
the stock right out and i'll replant in

1024
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,199
them for the veg and then that round uh

1025
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,000
you'll have to keep an eye on a little

1026
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,519
bit

1027
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
a little bit more and

1028
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,639
you might have to do more top dressings

1029
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,119
and more feedings

1030
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,480
on on that specific ground but it'll

1031
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,880
save you a bunch of work if you're

1032
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
dealing with with large numbers

1033
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
uh

1034
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,440
sometimes it's nice to be able to take

1035
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
10 or 12

1036
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,960
that are already

1037
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,640
hot enough to handle a veg period and

1038
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,480
just replanting them

1039
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,838
gotcha i was just curious on that one

1040
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
what you did because i know there's a

1041
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,000
couple different ways to go about it for

1042
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,680
sure let's go into k f so i think

1043
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
there's probably quite a few people here

1044
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,598
that are interested in knowing about knf

1045
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,199
that's not something that we've talked

1046
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,039
about yet on the podcast i haven't

1047
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,598
really had any guests that really talked

1048
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,920
about k f so let's just get a little bit

1049
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,000
into it today maybe in the future i can

1050
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,400
have somebody on here to talk a full

1051
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,239
blown episode with k f i know you just

1052
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,160
do a little bit of k f can you talk to

1053
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,000
us about you know what is k f and then

1054
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,440
what are some of the k f methods that

1055
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,079
you practice

1056
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,800
so k f just stands for korean natural

1057
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,079
farming uh it's a it's a way of

1058
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,920
organically growing uh in making your

1059
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
own amendments

1060
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,358
uh a lot of people are dependent

1061
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,279
most of us are dependent on going to a

1062
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,639
store and buying our own amendments

1063
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,040
whether that's

1064
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:22,078
uh a nutrient line or or even organic

1065
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,639
amendments that are dried out and

1066
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
to to get away from that you can

1067
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,279
start

1068
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,838
exploring the land of knf and

1069
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,079
uh master chao is the guy that

1070
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,679
kind of invented it or coined it or or

1071
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,880
whatever you wanna whatever you wanna

1072
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,919
say

1073
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,920
and

1074
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,000
he

1075
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,838
shows you a plethora of different ways

1076
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
to make things like fermented plant

1077
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,599
juice and uh

1078
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,280
labs and

1079
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,680
you can

1080
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,200
essentially replace everything you're

1081
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,799
doing with

1082
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,679
natural products that you can make at

1083
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,599
home okay and then what do you typically

1084
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,078
do for k f

1085
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,838
i can't the only k f that i've

1086
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,039
personally messed with

1087
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,440
is like fermented plant juice uh i have

1088
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,519
tried to make a few imo boxes

1089
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,800
i'm still looking for the right area for

1090
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,280
it uh

1091
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,839
an imo is where you take

1092
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,599
a sticky form of

1093
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:21,920
rice uh you you cook up some rice you

1094
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,640
get a sticky rice and you put it in a

1095
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
box literally and you cover it up with a

1096
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,838
paper towel

1097
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,079
put it out in the forest where you where

1098
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,400
you see there's a high microbial life

1099
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,280
and you hope that

1100
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,358
that rice gets inoculated by the

1101
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,680
naturally occurring

1102
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,440
funguses that are in that forest and

1103
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,679
then you do some more there's like eight

1104
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
18 more processes and i'm just a

1105
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,598
beginner in k f

1106
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,839
so i don't know exactly what happens

1107
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,240
after that but you know that's the stuff

1108
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,719
that i've been practicing so far

1109
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,319
and it's it's a really fascinating world

1110
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,559
to dive into because it starts getting

1111
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,640
into the specifics of

1112
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,719
exactly what's scientifically happening

1113
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,480
when you feed your soil and when the

1114
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,639
plant is

1115
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,880
uptaking nutrients from the things that

1116
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,039
you've given it with organics you kind

1117
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,559
of take a step back and you're you're

1118
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,920
just kind of

1119
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,880
mixing things together and letting

1120
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,960
nature take its course and then with knf

1121
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,119
in my opinion it starts diving back into

1122
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,159
the territory where you're in full

1123
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,240
control

1124
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,519
and you know exactly what each products

1125
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,959
for and

1126
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,719
what's happening when you give that

1127
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,039
product and

1128
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,719
and why that's so cool yeah a whole

1129
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,800
different rabbit hole to go down you

1130
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,159
know i mentioned this in far too many of

1131
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,480
my videos but there are so many

1132
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,960
different ways to grow this plant you

1133
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,800
know and knf is another method to grow

1134
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
it yeah

1135
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,440
i was just watching some of chris

1136
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,759
trump's videos uh if you guys are

1137
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,200
interested in learning more k f i i

1138
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,599
highly suggest checking out some of

1139
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,598
those videos they're very informative

1140
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,359
and they'll kind of go step by step in

1141
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,960
explaining

1142
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,159
what's going on with k f and why it's

1143
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,159
really important

1144
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,719
i've heard his name quite a few times i

1145
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,039
heard he's an excellent resource for k f

1146
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,838
super smart super smart individual

1147
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,358
let's uh let's talk about one more thing

1148
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,039
ipm you know i sometimes i feel like we

1149
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,358
should talk about this first you know

1150
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,519
pest prevention right what do we do to

1151
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:18,960
what do we do to prevent pests i know

1152
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:22,079
you grow organically you know all

1153
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,199
natural what is your ipm routine so

1154
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,039
first things first uh the best ipm

1155
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,279
routine that you can keep in an organic

1156
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,599
garden is make sure your your soil

1157
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,000
batteries are moist always

1158
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,559
that's going to be your first step

1159
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,318
the second step is i love to use jadam

1160
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,599
it's a wedding agent

1161
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,599
uh

1162
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,680
and it kind of follows along the same

1163
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,280
lines as knf just a different category

1164
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,318
of learning in

1165
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
in

1166
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,519
practice

1167
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,799
and

1168
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:58,159
it works so well as a disrefacton it has

1169
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,400
a super widespread covering of the

1170
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,118
leaves uh

1171
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,559
it's super easy to coat both sides of

1172
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,720
the leaves and

1173
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,519
it doesn't have any downsides that i've

1174
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,559
seen

1175
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,199
it's a

1176
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,239
it's a natural disrefacton it degrades

1177
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,838
off the plant naturally uh within a few

1178
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,519
days so

1179
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,440
i've i've used it all the way through

1180
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,800
flour even

1181
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,559
and not notice the difference in

1182
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
my product the way it tastes the way it

1183
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,159
smells

1184
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,639
and it's just gener generally a great

1185
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,719
idea to have around if that if that's

1186
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,679
not enough then i'll start adding

1187
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,519
neem seed oil and lavender

1188
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,519
to the to the judom

1189
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,159
so that not only is it getting that

1190
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,599
awesome widespread coverage

1191
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,399
but it has

1192
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,519
more

1193
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,119
insect uh repellent and management

1194
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,358
ingredients in it that are going to be

1195
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,519
more effective because of that spray how

1196
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,519
often do you spray and at what point in

1197
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,159
the day do you spray

1198
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,358
so if i'm having pest issues i'll spray

1199
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,960
every day

1200
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:05,279
if i'm not having pest issues i'll spray

1201
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,318
twice to three times a week

1202
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,280
uh

1203
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,960
and and more often in the veg if i'm not

1204
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,720
spraying with your dom i'll just spray

1205
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,519
with just plain water uh in the veg and

1206
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,838
just the act of of getting the leaves

1207
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,400
moist and then them drying out is enough

1208
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,279
to kill certain insects in and their

1209
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
eggs

1210
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,079
so that practice alone can

1211
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,800
just save you a whole bunch of time and

1212
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,119
i usually use it like before lights on

1213
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,079
or uh yeah throughout the day okay yeah

1214
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,000
especially in flower i spray i spray

1215
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,079
before the lights are on probably 20

1216
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,960
minutes before i'll go in there in the

1217
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,960
dark

1218
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,119
and just kind of feel the plant while

1219
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,440
i'm spraying it which is another good

1220
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,800
way to ensure

1221
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,559
you're spraying the bottoms of the

1222
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,800
leaves so if you grab a stock and you

1223
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,719
just kind of spray in your hand while

1224
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,519
you're moving up the stock

1225
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,480
you know you're getting every leaf all

1226
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,318
the way up that stock even in the dark

1227
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,000
uh that's just kind of a trick i picked

1228
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:10,559
up after years of spraying plants

1229
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,719
but it it's very effective and it's

1230
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,679
gonna just physically disturb if there

1231
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,279
are eggs or actual pests on the bottoms

1232
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,358
of those leaves it will physically

1233
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,760
disturb them and

1234
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,759
remove them essentially i think a lot of

1235
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,359
people will spray during veg you know

1236
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,880
sometimes it's once a week i know you

1237
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,400
said every day you're spraying and then

1238
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,559
you mentioned flowering as well and a

1239
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,000
lot of people will stop spraying and

1240
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,719
flowering because they don't want any of

1241
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,119
this on their buds or flowers at all are

1242
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:40,078
you do you spray and flower as well uh i

1243
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,000
will only the jedom only the jadom

1244
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,079
uh that's the only thing i'll spray in

1245
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,760
flower and that's only because it

1246
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,640
naturally degrades within two to three

1247
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,319
days

1248
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,400
uh

1249
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:52,159
at first i was highly skeptical of doing

1250
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,240
that in flower

1251
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,078
and i was just like everybody else you

1252
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,639
know i was super worried that it was

1253
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,640
gonna affect the product in in any way

1254
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:04,960
and that's not cool not cool with me

1255
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,838
uh we gave it a shot

1256
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,400
on the last couple

1257
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,519
and

1258
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,599
nothing nothing bad happened i i mean we

1259
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,358
even if you have a pest issued during

1260
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,480
flower and that's why we really wanted

1261
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,719
to try it

1262
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,639
if you have a pest issue during flower

1263
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,239
you don't have a lot of options you know

1264
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,960
you can you can get some green lace wigs

1265
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,559
you can get some predatory mites you can

1266
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,400
there's like only a few things you can

1267
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,279
do without

1268
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,920
severely degrading your product

1269
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,960
and i was hoping that that could be one

1270
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,519
more thing we could add to our list uh

1271
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,079
to maybe save some plants in the future

1272
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,119
that we're not as lucky so you only

1273
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,359
spraying in flour if you see an issue or

1274
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,838
are you okay only if you okay i wasn't

1275
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,279
sure if you were still doing it as a

1276
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,440
preventative everyday spraying through a

1277
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,760
flower or not no no that'd be just

1278
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,599
that'd be so much work in and it's not

1279
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,839
if you're having that much of a problem

1280
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,200
it's not a practical solution

1281
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,719
uh

1282
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,480
and then i just i would have i would

1283
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,279
ought to drop the jadom thing a while

1284
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,880
ago

1285
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,920
but it but it is a good solution and

1286
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,119
it's

1287
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,920
super duper cheap it's super effective

1288
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,559
uh we actually have a video on green

1289
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,680
goblin 510 showing you how to make it

1290
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,078
yourself

1291
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,399
uh and it is available on the green

1292
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,640
goblin 510 website as well if you just

1293
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,680
want to give it a shot to see if it'd be

1294
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,318
worth it uh in your garden uh or worth

1295
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:34,960
it for you to make it and that's gonna

1296
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,358
help repel or battle off tons of pests

1297
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,599
right i mean we talking spider mites

1298
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,880
aphids things like that or oh yeah we're

1299
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,280
talking spider mites aphids thrips uh

1300
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,240
you name it it's it's it's a powerful

1301
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,839
disrefacton and it dry it's a it's a

1302
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,559
soap in reality so it dries out the

1303
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:53,440
exoskeletons

1304
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:54,960
of

1305
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,200
said bugs

1306
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,720
uh if the bug doesn't have an outer

1307
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,239
exoskeleton

1308
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:04,959
it's even it's gonna work even better

1309
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,279
so it really doesn't have a downside and

1310
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,519
if you use it as intended and you and

1311
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,000
you mix it as intended you'll dilute it

1312
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,639
in a in your in your ipm regimen you

1313
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,920
know there's no reason not to use it man

1314
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,400
it's saved me so many headaches in in

1315
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,079
pest management that i can't speak

1316
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,519
highly of it enough

1317
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,119
that's awesome

1318
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,400
now we have a lot of good information

1319
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,800
this video you know we talked about

1320
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,318
mixing soil we talked about feeding

1321
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,920
