00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:03,158
people and be on the same level as far

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,359
as things that you could talk about and

86
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,919

talk to someone who also makes YouTube

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
and yeah it's like you're talking a

97
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,119
different language and you're talking to

98
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,518

description section below thank you

118
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,199
buddy so tell us a little bit about

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,199
yourself and how you got into gardening

120
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,399
oh man I've been into uh these plants

121
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,199
that we like so much for a long time

122
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,959
since I was young actually I used to

123
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,120
read about all kinds of cool growing

124
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,600
techniques and gardening

125
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,040
magazines but I never really got into

126
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,360
growing much back then just cuz the laws

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,280
weren't very favorable in my area

128
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,360
but in like 2017 is when I moved to

129
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,239
Colorado and not long after living in

130
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,120
Colorado I got a job in a big commercial

131
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,439
grow I did that for a few years working

132
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,360
in the Harvest side of things I did a

133
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,319
few big Harvest Crews we would go around

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,280
to a lot of different grow facilities so

135
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,360
that job was really cool cuz I got to

136
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,638
experience a lot of different growth

137
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,400
facilities just from one job and I

138
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,199
eventually moved to the cultivation side

139
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,279
of

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,080
the commercial grow space and eventually

141
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,359
when I moved out of my tiny apartment I

142
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,758
was like hey I'm living in Denver now

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,879
I'm going to start growing at home and

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
so that really all started in 2017

145
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,240
talking about your grow style are you

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,400
indoors Outdoors soil cocoa Hydro

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,600
organic synthetic what's your style uh

148
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:29,519
indoor I've only done indoor so

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,639
far and I've only really done synthetic

150
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,839
like salt-based nutrients so far most of

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,519
the grows I've done have been in cocoa

152
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:41,079
or like a cocoa mix but recently I moved

153
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,918
to like a flood and drain style growing

154
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,478
with uh hydren pellets the little

155
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,240
expanded clay pellets which is been

156
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,279
pretty fun I've been enjoying that how

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,960
much of the commercial side of things

158
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,799
like the processes that they do

159
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,839
commercially how much of that do you

160
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,038
take and Implement in your home grow

161
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,560
there's some of it that is

162
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:07,120
very you that was useful for me to see

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,800
just like um having a a sop and having a

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,879
way you do things and knowing like how

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,038
important it is maybe to only try to

166
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,719
implement one new change at a time

167
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,598
because if I'm implementing three new

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
changes at a time and one of them works

169
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:21,719
it's going to be really hard for me to

170
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,719
tell which one

171
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,680
worked um things like trellising

172
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,560
learning the importance of just learning

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,400
the importance of things that every grow

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,759
facility I've ever been in does across

175
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,560
the board and you're like there has to

176
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,080
be a reason why we're all doing this

177
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,439
like nice

178
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,439
defoliations trellising and supporting

179
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,279
your plants getting nice light

180
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,279
penetration and uh CO2 I don't know if I

181
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,159
would have been so determined that like

182
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,359
I have to run CO2 if I wouldn't have

183
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,680
seen like every single commercial

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,038
facility is all running CO2 and we're

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
going to get to CO2 here in a little bit

186
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,800
I know for homeg growing there's it's

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,598
kind of split between the people who do

188
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,918
supplement CO2 and people who don't

189
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,839
supplement CO2 so eager to hear your

190
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,240
thoughts on that here in a little bit so

191
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,478
in the commercial facilities that you

192
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,519
spoke about that you worked in did they

193
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,038
have an EB andf flow style like the

194
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,680
flood and drain style that you do now in

195
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,318
your home grow only at the very very

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,879
first grow facility I ever worked at

197
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,800
which I was on the cultivation side

198
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,039
there but it was such a large facility

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,000
and I was such a new employee there that

200
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:36,159
my main job was mostly just scrubbing

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,319
out reservoirs all day nothing uh really

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
glamorous and I didn't really get a

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
chance to learn a whole lot but they

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,520
were running basically the same exact

205
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,758
setup I'm running at home just on a much

206
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,918
larger scale but that's the only

207
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,000
commercial facility I've ever been in

208
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,560
that had that setup got it so you're

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,478
able to get a little bit of Knowledge

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,478
from there and bring it to your home

211
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,158
grow because of that at least it wasn't

212
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,639
like completely foreign I knew what the

213
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,279
base basic parts of the setup where I

214
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,840
knew how it functioned I knew how to

215
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,559
take one apart and put it back together

216
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,158
so that was a lot of weight off my

217
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
shoulders already cuz when you're

218
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,800
getting in like at least for me when I

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,038
was getting into this having all these

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,079
timers and water pumps and everything is

221
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,240
dependent on the

222
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,279
electricity it could all feel really

223
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
overwhelming really fast and so it was

224
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,959
nice to start with at least a system I

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,520
had had my hands on before yeah I can

226
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,758
imagine I know there's a lot of new

227
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,038
Growers out there that really get

228
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,000
intimidated by all the pieces of

229
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,598
equipment you know when it comes to the

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,360
hydroponic setup now we do have quite a

231
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,800
few beginners that tune into this

232
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,680
podcast we have beginners intermediate

233
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,159
and also Advanced folks looping in the

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,639
beginners there are some folks that

235
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,439
probably don't know what an ENT flow

236
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,759
system is could you explain what it is

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,000
and how it works yeah for sure um so

238
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,360
it's basically you have all of your

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,679
nutrients and your water in one main

240
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,680
reservoir you just have a couple of

241
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,838
pumps and timers and your timer is set

242
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,519
up to

243
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,200
where your water from your Reservoir

244
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,919
pumps to the buckets where your plants

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,000
are for a certain amount of time let's

246
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,639
them get some nutrient uptake and then

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,958
after whatever time you determine it

248
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,480
pumps the water out of the plant bucket

249
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,078
back into the main reservoir you can

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,839
just set that up to cycle throughout the

251
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:26,519
day so you can get different periods of

252
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,680
flooding and draining so you have

253
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,039
different periods where you have

254
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,278
nutrient uptake you have periods where

255
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,000
you also have a lot of availability for

256
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,559
the roots to get oxygen so you don't

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
have to worry about root rot and stuff

258
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,879
like that okay and then would that be on

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
a schedule can you talk about kind of

260
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,078
the watering flooding schedule for the

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,278
Ed and flow setup yeah the the system I

262
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,439
have right now is just some like the old

263
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,799
school analog timer where you push the

264
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,079
little pins out so every one of those

265
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,240
pins is 15 minutes and when I have a

266
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,799
Little Seedling that's just like in the

267
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,879
Little Pete Moss Cube I'll really only

268
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,159
try to

269
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,838
touch that Cube enough times throughout

270
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:10,519
the day so it doesn't dry out so maybe

271
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,880
one 15 minute flood every 2 or 3 hours

272
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,120
depending on how it seems to be reacting

273
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,240
and then as the plant is growing and

274
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,159
getting bigger then I'm bumping it up a

275
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,720
little maybe I'll go one 15 minute flood

276
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,439
every hour and then by the time I'm all

277
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,519
the way into flower and the plants are

278
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
bigger depending on how big the plants

279
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,440
are I might be flooding

280
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,239
multiple times per hour all the way

281
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,600
throughout the day 24 hours a day got it

282
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,200
and I assume that you've got nutrients

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,079
in there are you using some synthetic

284
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,000
line of nutrients and what's the EC or

285
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,599
PPM that you aim for for the different

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,039
stages of growth uh yeah I'm running uh

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,360
all salt-based nutrients right now

288
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,039
recently I've been running um Athena

289
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,519
I've been liking it a lot it's my first

290
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,360
run with Athena and I've also recently

291
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:05,560
been running autof flowers which I'm not

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,600
used to so usually I might be and a lot

293
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:11,278
of times I'm just testing this in like a

294
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,320
PPM reading so a lot of times in veg I

295
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:18,078
might be getting up to 700 or 800 ppms

296
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:22,040
in the peak of veg and then maybe even

297
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,879
over a th000 ppms in the peak of flow

298
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,679
but I found that these Auto flowers have

299
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,799
been running it's just a few but they

300
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,439
seem to like a lot or need a lot less

301
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,078
nutrients so I've been running about

302
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,320
half of that strength with the auto

303
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,039
flowers I've pretty much been taking the

304
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,480
feeding chart that Athena recommends and

305
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,879
just cutting it straight in half and

306
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,039
it's been working really well yeah

307
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,278
that's a common question that people ask

308
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,919
is about autof flowers and their feeding

309
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,240
it's often here that there it requires

310
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,000
less nutrition and there's some people

311
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,000
that say no it requires the same amount

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,039
so I think that's one of like the

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,240
debated topics amongst the community is

314
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,439
whether or not Autos should be treating

315
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,879
differently when it comes to feedings so

316
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,839
it's interesting to hear that your

317
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,078
experience that yeah you've had to cut

318
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
the dose in half there I heard the same

319
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,399
thing and so I tried I went with the

320
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,800
full

321
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,320
strength and I could just you could see

322
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,519
the normal signs it it just wasn't happy

323
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,800
you could see the leaf tip burn

324
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,759
starting and then I just backed off I

325
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,519
was like I let it go for maybe a whole

326
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,879
week before I was like I got to change

327
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,639
this Reservoir it's just too much

328
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,320
because it felt like too much because I

329
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,720
think what it was recommending even

330
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,839
early in veg was 1100 PPM and it said

331
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,199
that this

332
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,079
formulation is made to run at a higher

333
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,000
EC and I was like all right let's let's

334
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,479
try it never tried these nutrients

335
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,919
before I'll go with what they recommend

336
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,440
and I think it was just this particular

337
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,240
cultivar because the whole plant I mean

338
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,279
finished is only this big and so it

339
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,600
makes sense that it doesn't need that

340
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:59,240
much salt true yeah I know some aut

341
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,480
flowers can grow massive and then some

342
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,159
stay squat really comes down to genetics

343
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,560
obviously it comes down to other things

344
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,519
lighting environment nutrition all that

345
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,879
stuff but yeah some could be real small

346
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,799
so it makes sense for those smaller

347
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,919
plants to need lesser nutrition right

348
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,479
yeah it does to me now mixing up those

349
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,799
nutrients in water what is your water

350
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,480
source are you just using tap water or

351
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,719
are you filtering the water in some way

352
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,680
like reverse osmosis or what's your

353
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,480
water source I have a uh 75 gallon per

354
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,838
day AR filter in the house it's just

355
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,320
hooked up underneath my kitchen sink and

356
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,279
it's off 90% of the time but I know like

357
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
every time I'm about to have to say I

358
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,120
have to fill my reservoir tomorrow I'm

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,360
going to change it I'll go ahead and

360
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,720
turn on the filter tonight fill me up a

361
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,800
few five gallon buckets and get ready so

362
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,320
I always have uh the AR water at the

363
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,599
house I don't have to worry about going

364
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,680
and trying to get distilled water

365
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
worrying about what's in my water supply

366
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,319
because I know just a few years ago here

367
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,079
in Denver the city of Denver has sent

368
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,079
out brido water filters to everyone and

369
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,399
they're like hey we highly suggest that

370
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,439
before you drink the water from your

371
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,480
sink that you put it through this brida

372
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,800
filter so

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,759
since uh a lot of plants are so good at

374
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,559
holding on to things like heavy metals

375
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,199
and stuff that they have access through

376
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,399
through the roots I just figured that's

377
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,278
nothing I want to risk yeah better safe

378
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,519
than sorry man a similar boat to you I

379
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,600
live in Las Vegas and out the tap it's

380
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,480
485 PPM a lot of people who who tuned

381
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,959
into my content I've heard me say that a

382
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,360
ton of times but I fig I'd mention it

383
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:47,399
here and so yeah I also use reverse

384
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,720
osmosis and I like how the newer systems

385
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,120
are now kind of a one for one the past

386
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,320
system I had was a one for three for

387
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,879
every one gallon you get of reverse

388
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,240
osmosis water you're wasting three

389
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,320
gallons MH now the system that I bought

390
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,240
is a one for one which is so much better

391
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,199
and it's so much faster yes bigger

392
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,759
tubing you have the same one or uh no I

393
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,359
don't I'm still on the old one I don't

394
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:17,959
think it I don't know what the ratio is

395
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,919
but if you hold up the waist line and

396
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,758
the fill line you see the waistline

397
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,078
pouring and the fill line dripping and I

398
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,039
hate doing that I'm always trying to

399
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,599
figure out what what can we use this

400
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,399
water for what can we use this waste

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
water for and a lot of people what they

402
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,360
do is they put in their backyard they

403
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,559
water their plants out back with it

404
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,399
we've done that too for the house plants

405
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,758
some people use it and they they uh have

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,839
their drain line hooked up to a five

407
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,240
gallon bucket and they flush their

408
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,880
toilets with it oh that's smart that's

409
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,759
smart save you a couple of toilet

410
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,198
flushes there you go right so yeah you

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,159
can use that water and then a lot of

412
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,758
water sources they go right back into

413
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,439
the local water Min spell system and it

414
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,560
gets clean so is it really being fully

415
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,720
wasted

416
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,399
well it's going back into the system

417
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
yeah but there's energy that takes to

418
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
kind of recan and stuff like that so

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,120
yeah that's that's a bigger debate here

420
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,800
yeah okay and then after you mix in the

421
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,799
nutrients does it require a pH

422
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,958
adjustment at all uh yes well the way

423
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:21,479
Athena works is you put in the pH

424
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,198
adjustment first so it's sort of a

425
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,480
little it's actually the exact opposite

426
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,159
of what you would expect from a lot of

427
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,000
other lines where you would mix all of

428
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,078
your stuff and then adjust your pH at

429
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,159
the end you do it that way the first

430
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:39,039
time to judge how many milliliters per

431
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:44,159
gallon I needed then the next time you

432
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:48,439
can do that first but um with Hydro

433
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:52,120
especially I'm always super on top or I

434
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,800
try to be super on top of the pH because

435
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,360
not only have I experienced with Hydro

436
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,159
something I never dealt with before

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,519
which is a pH drift cuz I never really

438
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,838
had a reservoir of nutrients sitting

439
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,240
around for you know two weeks I would

440
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:07,359
mix up the nutrients and I would use

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
them that

442
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,318
day so you'll get a little drift your pH

443
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,759
will slightly rise over time and I think

444
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,678
that's because probably because I have a

445
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,720
AirStone in my reservoir but also with

446
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,720
Hydro there's

447
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,600
no uh buffer like if you had soil it

448
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,600
probably would be a much better buffer

449
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,599
cocoa would even be a good buffer if you

450
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,439
have some beneficial back IIA that's

451
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:38,480
going to help be a mediator between this

452
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,440
crazy pH water and your bare Roots but

453
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,480
in the hydro system it's just bare Roots

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,960
the nutrient mix goes right to them and

455
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,960
if you have a nutrient mix and the pH is

456
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,880
way way off that could really really

457
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,279
affect your plants with just like one or

458
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,840
two feedings so I try to go in every

459
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,519
single morning I check the pH every

460
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:01,399
morning adjust if needed and again in

461
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,480
the afternoon so I'm trying to check and

462
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,159
adjust my pH as needed twice a day got

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,079
it and what do you typically aim for for

464
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:13,360
a pH I'm going for uh 58 to

465
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,079
62 and when I first will reset the

466
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,759
reservoir like the first night I'm

467
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,678
always making sure that I'm shooting for

468
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:23,400
that low end so I'll shoot for the 5.8

469
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,880
cuz I know if in the 10 or 12 hours I'm

470
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,600
gone before I check it again if it does

471
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,720
rise a little bit hopefully I won't get

472
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,079
out of my sweet spot if that 58 to 62

473
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,079
okay that's typically what I'm aiming

474
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:38,279
for in deep water culture so similar

475
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:40,240
with Hydro setup right and I use blue

476
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,519
planet nutrients and the cool thing

477
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,919
about that set of nutrient lineup is

478
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,720
once I mix it in the nutrients it always

479
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,720
mixes up to 5.8 pH so it's like just

480
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,880
perfect exactly where I want it and so

481
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,240
when I change the reservoir I add that

482
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,440
in there and it's at the perfect set pH

483
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,359
now I do encounter a little bit of pH

484
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,679
Drift But I've noticed for the most part

485
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,240
it drift downwards I know some people

486
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,000
say the opposite they say it drifts

487
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,279
upwards for them but yeah I mean I go

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,720
5.8 pH the next St check it'll be at 5.5

489
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,798
I've even it's even gone down to like

490
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,759
5.1 and I have to pH Up it see I've

491
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,720
never heard of that either because even

492
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,679
before this I've only done Hydro a few

493
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,200
times and before this I was running um

494
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,200
the General Hydroponics uh Flora series

495
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,159
I think I was running like it was the

496
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,640
three-part Flora series plus a few

497
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,080
additives madebe a six part or something

498
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,440
like that and I was having the same

499
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,720
issue with the drift but it was still

500
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,080
going up and since I was really new to

501
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,839
this I just started asking around and

502
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:44,038
what I seem to hear from everyone is

503
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:47,038
that pH drift is common and it usually

504
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,400
always drifts up and I got a million

505
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,720
different reasons why that could happen

506
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,000
but I never really heard about it going

507
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,279
down yeah me neither until I actually

508
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,679
experienced it yeah but yeah I've been

509
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,119
able to adjust it and and get things

510
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,640
back on track there so but yeah five 8

511
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
6.2 same exact range I aim for nice I

512
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,400
want to take a step back and get more

513
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,200
into your gross space what size grow

514
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,880
space are you in and how many plants do

515
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,960
you typically run in that space what

516
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,000
I've been liking the most until I

517
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:22,120
recently had to downsize was a 5x5 tent

518
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was running two 5x5 tents I had like a

519
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,158
big basement that they could both go in

520
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,119
but I liked having the grow spaces

521
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,360
separated cuz I'd rather have two

522
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,639
harvests at two separate times rather

523
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,959
than harvesting a 10x10 plant and having

524
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,880
to deal with that whole drying and trim

525
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,120
gel of a

526
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,640
10x10 so I'll run the 5x5 and I like to

527
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,519
space out just four plants in there so

528
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,520
I'll be able to run those four plants a

529
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,158
little bit bigger but with uh some

530
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,079
trellising I'll still be able to fill

531
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,799
out the canopy all the way from corner

532
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,000
to corner really nice and I like that

533
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,359
mix cuz it's not too crowded and it's

534
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,519
not too many plants for me to work

535
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,240
on but with these new auto flowers I'm

536
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,918
running I'm looking at a 5x5 and

537
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,679
thinking that if I had these ones that

538
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,000
are staying this small and this wide you

539
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,440
know a foot tall and a foot wide that

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,759
there's no telling how many I could run

541
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,880
in a 5x5 especially if I'm doing like

542
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,640
three gallon pots maybe is that what

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
you're doing right now three gallon or I

544
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,400
have been doing five gallon pots but

545
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,079
that's because I'm usually running photo

546
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,000
period plants that let veg for a few

547
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,839
months and I usually run them pretty big

548
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,079
and so I want that big root mass for the

549
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,720
bigger plant but on this plant I'm

550
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,000
running now that's an

551
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,880
autoflow I don't think the plant is

552
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,278
barely is as wide as the pot is and the

553
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,360
rule of thumb I I've always heard as is

554
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:53,960
as above so below so roughly the size

555
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,240
and shape of your plant above the ground

556
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,798
will be roughly what your root mass size

557
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
will be so if I'm going off that I'm

558
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,558
looking at this pot and thinking it

559
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,960
might not even be needed to be that big

560
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,038
yeah I know a ton of people get away

561
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,558
with just one gallon containers in WoW

562
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,240
EB and flow system for example so they

563
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,639
can go a lot smaller and remind me I

564
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,480
know you said in the very beginning but

565
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,360
what's in the containers is it just

566
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,480
hydroton or did you say Coco I have a um

567
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,038
so inside of the buckets themselves

568
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,360
there're Square buckets and I have

569
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,798
square fabric pots the fabric pot is

570
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,079
filled with hydrogen clay play pets and

571
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:35,480
then right in the middle of that is like

572
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,000
a little net basket and that's what I'll

573
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,798
um have where I'm starting my seedling

574
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,960
and in the middle of the net basket will

575
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,839
be like a little Pete Moss based growing

576
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,278
Cube like a little rapid rotter Cube

577
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,879
okay got it and then since you're in a

578
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:53,359
flood drain system tray in that 5x5 are

579
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,039
you running a is it a 4ot by 4ot tray or

580
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,599
or what now the re the way this setup

581
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:02,480
works is it's all contained in buckets

582
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,439
so oh okay there's the reservoir and

583
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,960
then what you have called the brain

584
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,640
bucket and it has a few floats and

585
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,360
sensors in it and it just has lines at

586
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,559
the very bottom of the bucket so the

587
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,639
brain bucket which what it's called the

588
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,918
main bucket that feeds all your plant

589
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,559
buckets it will fill up to whatever

590
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,320
level you set it with the float and then

591
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,558
through the outlets in the very bottom

592
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,879
of that bucket it just leaks out through

593
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,798
the force of gravity and whatever level

594
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,240
this brain bucket is everything just

595
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,960
sort of settles out at that same level

596
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,120
and then when it's time to drain back to

597
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,960
the reservoir there's one pump in the

598
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,319
brain bucket that sort of sucks all the

599
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,759
water back from all of the plant buckets

600
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,119
and pumps it back to the reservoir got

601
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,519
it okay so it's a little bit different

602
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,678
than the traditional style ebb and flow

603
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,519
system where you have a a flood tray

604
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,679
yeah usually you might have like a table

605
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,038
like you're describing and you could

606
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,480
just flood the whole table let that sit

607
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,599
there for a while and then just let

608
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,360
gravity drain the whole table out

609
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,719
exactly but this way you have a little

610
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,319
more flexibility with your layout so I

611
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,079
could go maybe different different

612
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,720
shapes or wider than a tray might allow

613
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,918
me to go without having to buy a new

614
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,319
tray you know because with this I have a

615
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:20,320
30 gallon Reservoir that I only really

616
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,599
fill up to about 25 gallons full but

617
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,439
with this one brain bucket if I had like

618
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:29,079
a 60-gallon reservoir I could run you

619
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,159
know two dozen plant sites plant buckets

620
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,599
from that one brain bucket that's

621
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
awesome seems like you get some good

622
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,038
flexibility doing it that way yeah it

623
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,278
seems really cool I've never really

624
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,000
expanded it to more than four plants cuz

625
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:45,038
I've never really run this system in

626
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,960
anything bigger than a 5x5 but all if I

627
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,240
ever want to all I have to do is grab a

628
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,519
few more buckets and a few more beat of

629
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,480
rubber hose nice is this been on your

630
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,798
channel yet do you have videos of this

631
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,519
setup or maybe on your Instagram or no

632
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,839
no we've been running through it a

633
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:04,519
little bit on our live streams recently

634
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,798
but the

635
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:10,119
last grow series I did we were still in

636
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:14,759
Coco that was The Beginner's grow Guide

637
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:16,719
Series then I ran a 5x5 with the hydren

638
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,759
and the hydro setup like we've been

639
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,558
talking about in my kitchen and I did

640
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,599
end up filming the whole thing even

641
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,038
though it was sort of just to film it

642
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,639
cuz it was funny I'm growing a 5x5 tent

643
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:31,879
in my active kitchen that I also cook

644
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,559
dinner and eat in every day but I never

645
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,720
got around to uh eding it together I had

646
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,720
a bad habit of just filming the footage

647
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,960
and letting it sit in a folder thinking

648
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,640
you know I'll get to that one day and

649
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,480
now it's just gigabytes and gigabytes of

650
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,880
plant stuff and I need to find all these

651
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,720
notes and put it all together but I've

652
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,720
never put it out on the channel yet but

653
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,960
I'm gearing up right now setting up a

654
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,960
new grow space that I want to try a few

655
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,278
different kinds of I want to try like a

656
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,038
drip feed from the top too instead of a

657
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,440
flood and drain I want to try um I don't

658
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,038
know I want to try some new stuff so I'm

659
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,240
setting up some new growth spaces right

660
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:15,079
now so 2025 will hopefully have a lot of

661
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,240
hydroponics on the channel that's

662
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,079
awesome yeah I can totally relate when

663
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,519
you say that you you film all the

664
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,480
footage and then you never get around

665
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,319
editing it oh my gosh I have filmed

666
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,798
dozens of videos that never actually

667
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,038
made it to to YouTube Un unfortunately

668
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,679
because you know I don't think a lot of

669
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,240
viewers really understand how long it

670
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,600
takes to edit especially with a grow

671
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,159
video because

672
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:42,798
just the time involved you're looking at

673
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,080
at least four months of footage yep even

674
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:50,519
if you only go take a few Clips every

675
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:53,158
day that still so many shots yeah it's

676
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,319
it really is so getting into lighting

677
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,880
next what type of Lights do you use and

678
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,359
is there a certain amount of par that

679
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:06,320
you aim for freeer plants um I'm always

680
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:10,959
running uh LED lights it doesn't I

681
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:13,480
really don't have like a brand loyalty

682
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,440
to any specific LED

683
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,079
lights I know when I was first getting

684
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,440
into the legal industry I saw a lot of

685
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,158
places and I still do see a lot of

686
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,278
places running these big double-ended

687
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:34,278
12200 wat watt high pressure sodium

688
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:36,558
bulbs and they get so incredibly hot and

689
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,960
they use so much

690
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,798
energy it just doesn't make sense to me

691
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,919
why all of these facilities don't switch

692
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:46,038
over to LEDs especially with the LED

693
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,880
technology we have now like people are

694
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:51,640
growing amazing plants with LEDs so I

695
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,000
really like the LED I really like

696
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,759
any any light that I can take the

697
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,919
ballast off of the light and mount it

698
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,759
outside of the tent I really love those

699
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,679
cuz I like to uh shoot for lower Temps

700
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,200
at the end of flower especially if I

701
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,240
have something that has those really

702
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,558
pretty anthocyanins and I'm really

703
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:15,000
trying to bring that color change

704
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:17,839
out and uh as far as for like uh

705
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
par I really like anything I'm really

706
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:23,918
looking for that sweet spot of something

707
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,880
that can reach like a th micro moles per

708
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,840
meter squared per second I think is the

709
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
measurement yep ppfd

710
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,439
so I'm looking for that Center of that

711
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,639
heat map of the light and that's where

712
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,600
my eye always goes to First is it

713
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,080
hitting a TH or is it not because I know

714
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,480
especially like we were saying sometimes

715
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,759
if you're running

716
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,839
CO2 I feel like I can push the plant

717
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,398
harder with more lumens I can push it a

718
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,119
little harder with uh more heat I can

719
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:56,038
push it a little harder with nutrients

720
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,558
because it's just that CO2 is helping it

721
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:02,240
photosynthesize more efficiently

722
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:04,119
and uh I feel like if I want that really

723
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,480
bright light I would always rather have

724
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,759
more light than I need because you can

725
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,200
always turn it

726
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,720
down but if I get into the end of flower

727
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,159
and I feel like I don't have enough well

728
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,079
now I'm stuck with the light that I've

729
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,240
got yeah I completely agree being able

730
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,199
to dim it down it also increases the

731
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,880
lifespan of the fixture running it at a

732
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
lower percentage there yeah for sure

733
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,519
when you're not having to run it at a

734
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,399
100% all day every day yep so do you do

735
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,839
you know what brand and model like you

736
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:35,959
have in your 5x5 or the

737
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,398
5x5 was a spider farmer SE 7000 which is

738
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:44,159
a really nice light I really like it a

739
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:45,879
lot it's big and um it's bright but the

740
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,799
the ballast comes off so that was

741
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,679
helpful and it never gave me any

742
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:51,839
problems at all I actually just gifted

743
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,240
that light to a homie on the Discord so

744
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,240
I hope they're growing some good plants

745
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,480
with it now yeah that's nice of you yeah

746
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,960
spider farmer is a very popular brand

747
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,000
they've been around for so long now 10

748
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,880
plus years I know a lot of people run

749
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,720
their lights I had a handful of their

750
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,360
lights in the past and I used to do par

751
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,200
tests back in the day I think 2019 2020

752
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,879
and uh I had my hands on a bunch of

753
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,278
their fixtures and I used a couple of

754
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,399
their fixtures the

755
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:23,359
sp2000 I used SP 4000 see when they were

756
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,678
on the SP I don't even think I was

757
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,918
familiar with their products when they

758
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,559
were on the SP line I don't I don't even

759
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,640
know if I've heard of those

760
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,359
yeah I think I got it right but they

761
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,120
change up the line you know like the

762
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,678
acronyms for the line every few

763
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:39,759
years so I'm always getting confused but

764
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,159
I do see like even in the Discord

765
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,440
Community uh I see a lot of people in my

766
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,600
Discord running spider farmer lights and

767
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,038
all kinds of spider fer gear I'm sorry I

768
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:52,480
meant SF 2000 SF 4000 not SP yeah I

769
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,720
misspoke sorry it's been a long time

770
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,079
since I ran those

771
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,440
lights yeah but that's how they do they

772
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,359
will throw in a SP they'll throw in aill

773
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,759
SFS and they'll throw in SP and you'll

774
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,439
be like hold up what's the SP what is

775
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,519
sp yeah those are the board style that

776
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,320
they have I think they still sell it

777
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,120
today and then everybody's going after

778
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,839
the bar style which is the SE series

779
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,879
that that you had and I think that has a

780
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,839
lot better light spread provides that

781
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,159
light spread more even light spread

782
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,678
across across the coverage area having

783
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,919
that hot spot in the middle and then

784
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,038
having it drop off significantly towards

785
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,038
the outer edges that's kind of a thing

786
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:34,919
of the past now luckily uhhuh it's not

787
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:37,759
ideal at all and I also like the open

788
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,278
design of having these open bars rather

789
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:44,000
than a big hunk of like some kind of

790
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,880
plate because now all of that heat that

791
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,759
comes off your dodes it can just go

792
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,799
straight up between your bars instead of

793
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,240
having to make its way linger around

794
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,519
right at the top of your canopy until it

795
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,079
can eventually get blown by a fan and

796
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,839
make its way around that big board to

797
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,398
get up to your exhaust fan and make it

798
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,359
out true I know some of the heat does go

799
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,638
through the actual fixture it's kind of

800
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:08,558
like a heat sink so it does actually go

801
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:09,798
through it and and upwards and oh yeah

802
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,960
that's a good point too A lot of them

803
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,519
have like heat fins all over the top

804
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,519
yeah man there was some crazy designs

805
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,759
back in the day for for those things

806
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,880
yeah so heat is that an issue where you

807
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,679
are at um kind of let's get into

808
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,278
environment a little bit temperature

809
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,919
what do you typically aim for I'm

810
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:33,119
usually going for like a low around 75

811
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,919
maybe a high around like sometimes I'll

812
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,079
let I'll let some plants go like you

813
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,519
know high 80s uh like I'm not scared

814
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:47,599
when I have a a lot of CO2 in the tent

815
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm not scared to see 90° 89° 90° if the

816
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,519
plant looks healthy I have my little um

817
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,720
infr

818
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,759
red thermometer so I can put the uh

819
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,558
laser on a leaf and see what my leaf

820
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:05,558
surface temp is and as long as the leaf

821
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,558
surface temp isn't crazy high I'm don't

822
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,398
really mind running hot and then I tried

823
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,000
to not well and that that's is with

824
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,000
supplemented

825
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,398
CO2 and then for my nighttime temps I

826
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,359
try not to

827
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:22,398
swing I really never want to swing more

828
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,000
than 15° from day to night and I really

829
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,759
like to keep it more to like

830
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,638
10° and if I want to go colder at night

831
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,319
I like to start dropping down in the

832
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:35,359
daytime too I'm really always thinking

833
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:39,278
about like what is the plant evolved to

834
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,278
like over Millennia of growing

835
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,638
outdoors and in the end of the season

836
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,720
you're going to get colder tempts in the

837
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,479
day and the night so a lot of times I'll

838
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,399
try to mimic that same thing indoors and

839
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,639
that can have so many benefits I know Dr

840
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,518
Bruce bugby had mentioned oh jeez it was

841
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,038
years ago now where he had he had

842
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,519
revealed that a lot of people are

843
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,398
dropping the temps late and flower in

844
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,399
order to conserve the tpin that are

845
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,558
there you as I actually recently watched

846
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,879
one of your videos you were talking

847
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:07,638
about how the tpin can volatize

848
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,679
evaporate you lose them in the air right

849
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,480
the higher the temp I think it was a

850
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,079
curing video that that you were talking

851
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,599
about that uh in particular but that's

852
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,560
true when you're growing the plant as

853
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,240
well now a lot of people will open up

854
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,799
their grow tent or or open up their room

855
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,678
and they're like ah it smells beautiful

856
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,480
in here but they're running too high of

857
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,200
attempt so they're losing all that those

858
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,159
Turpin off the plan it's going into the

859
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,358
air yeah that all would have been in

860
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,559
your curing jar if your temp would have

861
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,598
been lower and I think some of these can

862
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,759
start to volatize and evaporate at as

863
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,599
low as like 70° like just regular

864
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,280
standard what you would consider a cool

865
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,480
comfortable room so if you're thinking

866
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,119
about these things trying to survive

867
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,320
right under this light and they're 6 in

868
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,200
away and they're

869
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,280
96° with no air flow they don't have a

870
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,358
chance they're doing everything can just

871
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,519
to survive cooking off those dry combs

872
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:05,679
at those High temps yeah yeah so like Dr

873
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:08,880
bugby had mentioned is people drop it

874
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,239
down to about 75° fenhe 78 degrees Fen

875
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,358
some people go lower than that and just

876
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:17,399
to translate to the folks who Us in

877
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:19,400
Celsius 75 degrees fhe is 23° C and then

878
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,280
you had mentioned you go sometimes up to

879
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,200
85° which is 29° C so just wanted to

880
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,000
convert that over for the folks that are

881
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,598
working in celsius instead of f night

882
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,159
thanks for that I would had no idea what

883
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,320
the conversion is okay so that's daytime

884
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,159
and nighttime temps and you mentioned

885
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,599
your running CO2 how about relative

886
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,679
humidity what do you typically aim for

887
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,720
there in the beginning of um veg I'm

888
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,159
trying like when I have a really small

889
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,199
seedling I'm trying to do whatever I can

890
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,838
I might even put a little Dome over it

891
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:55,559
I'm trying to get maybe

892
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:58,480
65% or more and as I'm going through veg

893
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:03,519
that's going to eventually taper off and

894
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,000
level out to maybe around 55 60 uh%

895
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,599
relative humidity I have a big chart on

896
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,440
the wall that shows you where your ideal

897
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:17,039
VPD range is uh at whatever specific

898
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,639
temp you are for whatever desired kilop

899
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:23,960
Pascal range and I'm always trying to

900
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:27,879
reference that chart nowadays um and get

901
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,000
the VPD dialed in and uh it always seems

902
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,880
to

903
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,920
feel if I was going for off my gut I

904
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,720
think I would always run the ENT a

905
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,480
little drier than what this VPD chart

906
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,959
tells me but I've just been going with

907
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,920
it um and the plants like it they like

908
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,039
it a little hot and sticky yeah I

909
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,159
typically aim for that VPD range as well

910
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,679
and to my surprise it's usually when I'm

911
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,480
looking at the temperature I'm running

912
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,838
and the humidity I I naturally used to

913
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,119
run before I even knew about VPD it fell

914
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,480
within that VPD range the ideal range on

915
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,119
those char there's different colors

916
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,519
right the dark green is the optimal

917
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,559
range and then there's a light green

918
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,159
which are really the tolerance range or

919
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,679
acceptable range to be in so it's a

920
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,118
little bit wider and then you have the

921
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,799
yellow range or even red some of them

922
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,838
have red ranges and that's like gives it

923
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,400
I'm sorry to cut you off but that's that

924
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,400
relates directly to how efficient this

925
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,639
plant is going to be at using nutrients

926
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,079
because if it's not able to transpire

927
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,118
properly at the rate it needs to well

928
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,519
then it's not going to draw up

929
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,400
water in the rate it needs to or at the

930
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,759
rate that it could 100% now I've seen a

931
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,838
lot of new folks that are beginners and

932
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,359
they get caught up with it they uh

933
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,239
struggle with running those higher

934
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,440
humidities CU often time it runs a

935
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,199
little bit higher of a humidity it calls

936
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,559
on the VPD chart for a little bit higher

937
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,719
of humidity than what some people are

938
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,039
traditionally used to here a lot of

939
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,598
people that say oh I run around 40%

940
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,279
relative humidity in flowering or some

941
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,800
people run 50% in Edge well depending on

942
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,480
the temperature that could potentially

943
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,200
be a little bit outside of that optimal

944
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,599
range now it's still within the

945
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,879
tolerance range so the planet is still

946
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,359
going to grow but some people do aim to

947
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,200
be in that dark green range at all times

948
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,639
and know these plants a lot of these

949
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,919
medicinal plants they will they'll put

950
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,719
up with a lot and they'll still grow and

951
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,079
they'll take you all the way to harvest

952
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:25,199
and if you never knew to try something

953
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,519
else you might not even see a sign that

954
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,439
they could do much better until you

955
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:33,199
tried that I agree I grow in the desert

956
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,480
here and there's been times where I

957
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:39,279
really didn't monitor VPD or humidity at

958
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,639
all this was before YouTube back in 2011

959
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,560
2012 before I started watching YouTube I

960
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:47,960
should say I was running 30% humidity

961
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,159
35% humidity the whole grow and the

962
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,639
plants still grow and I still got to

963
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,799
harvest yeah and and you'll never know

964
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,199
that oh man maybe my plants would have

965
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,640
been a lot cooler if I would have uh

966
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,639
paid PA attention to that because you

967
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,358
got done and you're like wow these look

968
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:06,719
amazing yeah exactly and it could have

969
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,679
been so much better yeah uh humidity is

970
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,279
one thing that is a little tricky for me

971
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:14,318
here in Denver just like it is for you

972
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,319
in Vegas I assume because it's just dry

973
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:21,199
here it's just super dry here so to get

974
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,920
this high humidity I'm always running a

975
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:27,399
humidifier and the the Hydroponics does

976
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,680
help a lot because say I'm in the 5x5

977
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,119
I'm running a little high temp and I

978
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,399
have five five gallon buckets in the

979
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,240
tent that fill up you know a majority of

980
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,160
the way full of water or I mean four of

981
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,759
them so for a lot of the portion of the

982
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:46,519
day there's 20 gallons of water just

983
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:51,119
like open to the air in the tent so that

984
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:54,679
helps a lot which was great until this

985
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,960
last 5x5 run it came up like it was

986
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:59,358
going to be just so happens the last few

987
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,800
weeks of flower I was going to be out of

988
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,559
town and I didn't really have anyone who

989
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,960
knew what they were doing to watch the

990
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,799
plants that could really you know play

991
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,480
it by ear and make adjustments I just

992
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,200
had to say when the water gets low add

993
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,960
some more water please um make sure the

994
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,719
house doesn't catch on fire I'll be back

995
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,358
as soon as I can but that humidity from

996
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:25,039
those buckets just from that even with

997
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,598
my exhaust fan set on 10 they said this

998
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,358
exhaust fan didn't go off the whole time

999
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,119
you were out of town

1000
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:32,679
but it just couldn't get it down enough

1001
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,960
which really surprised me in Colorado

1002
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:39,279
and I ended up getting Bud rot and like

1003
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,000
the majority of my bigger chunkier uh

1004
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,880
Bud sites I had Bud rot

1005
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,239
and it was it was really surprising but

1006
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,559
it was a big learning curve that I

1007
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,078
didn't really think about I'm

1008
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,679
introducing 20 gallons of water into

1009
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,400
this grow tent right under a hot lamp

1010
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,879
that's a lot of water that's a lot of

1011
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,079
humidity that I'm going to have to deal

1012
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
with and if I'm just exhausting it out

1013
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,680
into my lung room and sucking it right

1014
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,119
back up into the tent that humidity

1015
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,440
never had a chance to go anywhere so I

1016
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,440
end up having to use a uh I think I'm

1017
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,519
going to use a twoin one

1018
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,880
dehumidifier slac unit if I have to to

1019
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:20,280
fight that on my next round it's really

1020
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,119
shocking how much of an impact it has on

1021
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,359
the humidity I had the same thing my dwc

1022
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,358
system I don't even need to run a

1023
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,639
humidifier in this grot because the

1024
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:32,400
plant's just transpiring and it's

1025
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:34,639
raising up that humidity so quickly and

1026
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,559
then the exhaust kicks on a certain when

1027
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,279
it reaches a certain point and it

1028
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,358
exhausts the air out of there that that

1029
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,040
humid air in there and it brings in that

1030
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:46,719
dry air that I have naturally here in my

1031
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,920
house yeah now also it's true for auto

1032
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,679
watering systems so just going from

1033
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,760
handw watering soil for example going to

1034
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,799
an auto watering system whether it be a

1035
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,040
auto poot system or I running blue mats

1036
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,720
it's the same thing you you have that

1037
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,079
constant moisture level in there the

1038
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,879
plants able to take up water and

1039
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,760
transpire and it raises the whole

1040
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,079
humidity a lot of people run into the

1041
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,160
problem where U lights off they realize

1042
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,760
that lights off all of a sudden the

1043
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,960
plant is transpiring like crazy the

1044
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,560
humidity just spikes up and that's where

1045
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,838
a lot of people they'll end their light

1046
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:20,239
cycle and they open up their tent and

1047
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:24,078
they'll they'll start to see powdery

1048
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:27,239
mildew because of their unbeknownst to

1049
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,359
this humidity Spike during lights off so

1050
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,838
yeah it it's very surprising I was very

1051
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,159
shocked when I first encountered that

1052
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,838
it's helpful for me because I don't have

1053
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,239
to fill my humidifier as

1054
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,679
much yeah it's really nice it was a

1055
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,318
shock though cuz I thought like you know

1056
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,399
I thought this is going to be I thought

1057
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:45,358
about the humidity but I didn't like I

1058
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,800
really underestimated it I thought this

1059
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,639
is going to be nice you know I'm filling

1060
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,519
my humidifier less and my brother called

1061
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:54,078
me I'm in Texas at the time and my

1062
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:58,039
brother called me and he was like hey

1063
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,800
man this humidity is like above what you

1064
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,599
wrote down where it should be and the

1065
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,599
fan just won't go off I was like well

1066
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,720
you can open the door during lights on

1067
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,039
but at night like I don't know what you

1068
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:13,159
can do without me there like I would

1069
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:15,400
have to Workshop this in front of the

1070
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:18,318
tent and so I guess just to do what you

1071
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,280
can and I'll be home soon man that's

1072
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,358
rough yeah and that's one of the

1073
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,920
importance and and Lessons Learned I

1074
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:26,440
guess of if you can exhaust outside of

1075
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,000
the room entirely don't just dump it

1076
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,880
into your lung room now some people can

1077
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,838
get away with it but uh traditionally a

1078
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,240
lot of people have to resort to either

1079
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,400
drilling a hole in their wall to get it

1080
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,479
out to a whole different room or

1081
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,039
exhausting it out a window for example

1082
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,800
but yeah getting that air that's what

1083
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:45,759
I'm trying to set up for the new room I

1084
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,240
absolutely it's a must for me I'm going

1085
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,119
to have to exhaust every tent out of the

1086
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,679
house and I'm probably going to pull in

1087
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,119
uh or at least have the option to

1088
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,719
whenever I want flip on a and pull in

1089
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,960
room I mean air from outside of the

1090
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,759
house also so I can get the old air out

1091
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,838
the new Air in but it's a little

1092
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,400
different when you're running um CO2

1093
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,880
because I also don't just if I want if I

1094
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,559
can avoid it I don't want to just dump

1095
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,920
all my CO2 straight out of the window

1096
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,559
yes and that's I think where a lot of

1097
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,280
people steer themselves the wrong way is

1098
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,760
they'll supplement CO2 but then they'll

1099
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,920
have their inline fan kick on and

1100
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,559
exhaust it all out of the grow space

1101
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,800
yeah so let's get into Co a little bit

1102
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,040
deeper here how do you supplement CO2

1103
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,559
using the tanks or you using one of the

1104
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:38,159
other methods before um I've used I've

1105
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,519
never tried the little cans but I have

1106
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,000
tried the um uh what are they called I

1107
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,480
can't remember the name but the little

1108
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,519
uh mycelium

1109
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,199
bags I've had those I've ran them more

1110
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:53,759
than they recommend you to run them like

1111
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,239
more in my space than they say you

1112
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,760
need and it seemed like for me

1113
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:01,479
personally in my limited experience I

1114
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,920
could never really get the PPM of CO2 I

1115
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,760
was looking for I think the highest I

1116
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,760
ever got with three of those bags in a

1117
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:12,400
5x5 tent was like 860

1118
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,720
PPM so now I have got I just run a 20 lb

1119
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,519
tank I have a 20 lb tank right outside

1120
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,919
of my tent I have a automatic controller

1121
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,880
that goes in the tent there's a little

1122
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,760
fan in that controller that's always

1123
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,280
pulling air through the box and getting

1124
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,960
a CO2 rating on on it and I can set my

1125
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,920
high and low and so then if I set my low

1126
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:40,240
to say 800 and my high to

1127
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,559
1,400 as soon as the CO2 dips below 800

1128
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,519
the electronic valve will open and that

1129
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,480
tank will start leaking out CO2 it's

1130
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,880
just piped in through a little small air

1131
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,000
hose this run right to the very top of

1132
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,119
my tent because the CO2 is really heavy

1133
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,318
so I run it up top the goal is to have

1134
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,680
it fall down and as it's falling through

1135
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,440
the canopy

1136
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,399
all these fans towards the bottom of the

1137
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,079
tan are just going to keep it moving all

1138
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,000
around the leaf surfaces so they can

1139
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,800
just use it all the time because your

1140
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,760
Leaf can really only use the CO2 that is

1141
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,160
like right there touching the leaf

1142
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,480
surface on the top and the bottom so I

1143
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,558
always want to be moving it around but

1144
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,079
after you get it set up after I have

1145
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,760
this set up it was a little expensive

1146
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:26,039
the setup the controller is a little

1147
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
expensive the valve isn't very expensive

1148
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:30,159
but the electronic controller is and

1149
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,000
that first CO2

1150
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,799
tank I think was close to 200 bucks but

1151
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,440
the way it works is it's just an

1152
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,400
exchange program so now every time I

1153
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,559
want to go get more CO2 I just take my

1154
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,480
empty tank to the um grow shop drop it

1155
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,920
off and pick up a new one like they

1156
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,039
don't like refill it or anything they

1157
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,519
have full ones there waiting on you and

1158
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:57,960
that price to refill that is very very

1159
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,119
small like um I'm paying like a under I

1160
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,000
think it's like $15 I can't remember

1161
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,640
exactly it's so small that I don't even

1162
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,159
know the exact price because usually

1163
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,039
when I add it to whatever else I'm

1164
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,719
getting from the grow store like I can't

1165
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm not sure how much it costs you know

1166
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:18,480
it under 20 bucks is all I

1167
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:23,358
know but for the potential that you can

1168
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,800
get in your growth um and not just your

1169
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,920
growth because it's not always about

1170
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,160
biomass it's not always always about

1171
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,358
plant

1172
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:34,920
size to me I like the CO2 really because

1173
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:37,480
it makes my plant it just seems to make

1174
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,400
the plant more hearty in every way I can

1175
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,519
imagine it seems to make it more

1176
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,039
resilient to Drought stress more

1177
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:47,119
resilient to heat stress more resilient

1178
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:51,039
to Pest and

1179
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,599
pathogens and if I can get faster plant

1180
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,159
growth that's always great even if I'm

1181
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,519
not going for a bigger plant always like

1182
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,159
to get to harvest vest you know quicker

1183
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,280
if I can save a little time that's

1184
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:04,639
always great it gives me time to start a

1185
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,160
new round it's super beneficial I know

1186
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,759
there's a study out of Utah State

1187
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,639
University where they ran, 1400 PPM in

1188
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,200
the flowering stage and they got a 30%

1189
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,598
increase in yield I saw that I saw um

1190
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,239
that I think it was debacco University

1191
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,079
covered that on his YouTube channel and

1192
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,358
when you see those

1193
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,680
pictures of those plants you're like

1194
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,239
well that's clear that's clear as day

1195
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,879
that's the clearest thing I've ever seen

1196
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,919
like there's no way I'm going to it's

1197
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,880
when you realize it and for me it was

1198
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,039
really like what really made me look

1199
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,119
into it is when I realized how many of

1200
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,599
these big commercial

1201
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,800
facilities might cut Corners to save

1202
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:44,039
money here and there and there and there

1203
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,599
and they're cutting Corners to save

1204
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,679
money wherever they can but never ever

1205
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:53,720
ever on the CO2 the CO2 is running all

1206
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:56,159
day every day really high 1,400 1500

1207
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,598
ppms and it's because they've seen it

1208
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,598
it's because they've had a room that had

1209
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,200
a few hundred plants in it and then they

1210
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,519
had a room right beside it with a few

1211
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:07,199
hundred plants in it and they only had

1212
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:10,400
enough CO2 one round to run it in one

1213
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:13,118
room and they saw the difference in

1214
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,559
these two rooms and they were like okay

1215
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,000
that was huge that was a that was 30%

1216
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,000
more money came out of the same size

1217
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,239
room we can never make that mistake

1218
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,880
again yeah so super beneficial a lot of

1219
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,078
uh a lot of good can come out of it

1220
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,200
although it is a uh upfront cost you

1221
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,798
mentioned $200 for the tank to begin

1222
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:34,199
plus hundreds of dollars for the

1223
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:36,000
controller valve all that stuff but pays

1224
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,318
for itself pretty quickly there yeah I

1225
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,519
think so are you running it daytime only

1226
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,719
a lot of people will we just do CO2 in

1227
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,519
the daytime and they'll say ignore it

1228
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:50,558
during night time yeah um the controller

1229
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,838
I have is actually set up to run exactly

1230
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,160
that way so it has it's monitoring two

1231
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,798
things at the same time the first one is

1232
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,279
the fan that pulls the air through and

1233
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,599
reads the actual ppms of the CO2 the

1234
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
second thing is just a little light

1235
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,480
monitor right on the front of the

1236
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,480
controller box so and you put that

1237
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,519
inside of your tent and so anytime there

1238
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,199
isn't a very bright light source like if

1239
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,719
your grow light isn't turned on then

1240
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:20,318
that thing just defaults to stay off all

1241
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,480
night long so all during the night or

1242
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,000
all during lights off it's not putting

1243
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,199
out any CO2 at all and then as soon as

1244
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,838
the lights come on in the morning it

1245
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,399
just starts all over again pretty

1246
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,400
straightforward there one thing to

1247
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,039
mention about those tanks talking to uh

1248
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,000
what I call a buddy of mine Chris from

1249
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:38,239
Happy Hydro he was on the podcast

1250
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,119
actually twice now and one of the things

1251
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,078
he had mentioned is when he was running

1252
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,720
CO2 actually I think he I think the

1253
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,680
story had to do with this buddy running

1254
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,000
a CO2 and getting a tank from the gross

1255
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,719
store well he ended up getting a pest

1256
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,079
infestation from that tank now I don't

1257
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,519
know if this is just a a a one-off

1258
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,200
instance but having I think he got

1259
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,559
spider mites I don't know know how they

1260
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,239
were attached to the tank but he brought

1261
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,798
that in without cleaning the tank or

1262
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:05,679
whatever and then U and then his garden

1263
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:07,079
got infested so I don't know what the

1264
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,199
odds are what the chances of that

1265
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,440
happening but uh fig I'd mention that

1266
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,759
here in case anybody else uh is getting

1267
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,920
those tanks you might want to consider

1268
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,440
cleaning it off to to prevent pest from

1269
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,440
coming in and I've never um actually

1270
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,440
done that but I have had the thought

1271
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,119
before because I've been in the grow

1272
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,079
store hearing someone talk about having

1273
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,599
pest at home and I looked over at them

1274
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:33,359
like oh man we're in the same building

1275
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,440
right now the pest might have came from

1276
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,598
your cuz like if you're in the garden

1277
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,760
and they're on your clothes and then you

1278
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,680
come to the grow store with all these

1279
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,680
you know ornamental plants and all this

1280
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:46,000
soil to live in it's like a pest dream

1281
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:49,480
and they can just live in there and hit

1282
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,798
Chik home on your on your sleeve or on

1283
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,880
your CO2 tank that's scary happens more

1284
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,798
than we know it I'm sure so getting into

1285
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,240
pests a little bit more have you ever

1286
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:03,719
come across any major pest infestations

1287
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:07,118
luckily I've never come across any major

1288
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:11,000
pest infestations at home in my personal

1289
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,760
grow I've had pretty decent outbreaks of

1290
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,318
fungus knats a couple of times but those

1291
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,200
were pretty easily gotten under control

1292
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,759
with just some yellow sticky traps and

1293
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:26,199
some dious Earth on the top of my soil

1294
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,280
but working in the legal like commercial

1295
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,000
space

1296
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,200
face I have seen I've seen things that

1297
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,440
look like the movie Arachnophobia with

1298
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,078
spiderm I've seen thrips so thick that

1299
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,079
it makes you want to crawl out of your

1300
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:45,280
skin I've seen so many worst case

1301
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:47,200
scenarios I've seen rooms with you know

1302
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,960
pm and stuff that make it look like it's

1303
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:53,399
snowing when you shake the plants and so

1304
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:56,639
I've always been since day one when I

1305
00:52:53,400 --> 00:53:01,280
started my first Garden at home I've

1306
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:04,000
always been super duper scared of that

1307
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,160
cross-contamination from the commercial

1308
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,480
facility to my little home Garden cuz if

1309
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,598
I bring I look at the bugs and the past

1310
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,119
especially these

1311
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:18,280
spiderm in the commercial space as like

1312
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,000
super mites because you got to think

1313
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,720
they come from a colony of like 40

1314
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,960
million maybe 40 billion we have

1315
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:29,959
multiple multiple rooms each room has

1316
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:33,079
Maybe 100 a few hundred maybe a thousand

1317
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,599
plants and it's all like a big budget

1318
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,880
commercial grow they're running around

1319
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:39,960
spraying their IPM and trying their best

1320
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,240
to kill them so the ones that survived

1321
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,760
all of that are the strongest of the

1322
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:46,838
strong and they've lived in all these

1323
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,960
environments they were born and bred

1324
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:52,239
inside they they come from indoor

1325
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,119
gardens so I feel like if I get these

1326
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,919
little suckers in my

1327
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:59,559
house that I'll never get rid of of them

1328
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,639
cuz the infestations I see at work like

1329
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,319
usually when I see these infestations

1330
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,118
like the ones I'm talking about you just

1331
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:08,358
open the door and you immediately see

1332
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,079
webbing across a whole grow room there's

1333
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:14,039
nothing you can do for that and I've

1334
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,640
spent uh I've spent days pre Harvest is

1335
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,079
trying to do physical removal it's far

1336
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,838
too late into the grow cycle to use a

1337
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,200
chemical but I'll be going through with

1338
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:26,920
a wet paper towel or a rag or something

1339
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:29,519
trying to wipe the the nugs off before

1340
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,440
we go to harvest and it's just there's

1341
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,838
nothing you can do when it gets that far

1342
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:38,159
I think it's prevention is key so when I

1343
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:41,519
come home I always quarantine my clothes

1344
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,838
I will take my clothes off outside way

1345
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:46,440
as far away from my grow space as I can

1346
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,558
and I put those in a bag and I seal that

1347
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,639
bag up and they stay in that bag until

1348
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,559
they go to the laundry mat no chances

1349
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:56,400
it's a smart way to go about it I'm glad

1350
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:59,160
that you haven't had any major pest

1351
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,440
festations that you brought from the uh

1352
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,000
the commercial facility there that

1353
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,480
you've only come across fungus Nets and

1354
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,400
be able to get rid of them pretty easy

1355
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
that that's good to hear pest can be a

1356
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,838
challenge there are a lot of challenges

1357
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,920
that can occur really not just with pest

1358
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,599
but with different parts of growing EB

1359
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,358
and flow system can you talk to us about

1360
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,720
some of the common issues or challenges

1361
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,639
that new Growers May face when using an

1362
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:23,879
EB and flow system oh I think one of the

1363
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:26,318
most common issues cuz I'm still new to

1364
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,519
the EB and flow system so I think May

1365
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:31,119
maybe some of these beginner problems I

1366
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,519
haven't even faced yet so they're like

1367
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,480
um right around the corner probably for

1368
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:39,119
me find some new problems I haven't seen

1369
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,280
one really common one is it's really

1370
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,519
easy to forget that right behind you

1371
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,839
this Reservoir has 30 gallons of water

1372
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:51,119
in it and you forget how the properties

1373
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:53,239
of siphoning and gravity work and if the

1374
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,559
tip of this hose goes below the surface

1375
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:57,479
level of that water and I turn my back

1376
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,359
on it for two seconds I might have 20

1377
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,159
gallons of water in the

1378
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:06,078
floor then you have like things like pH

1379
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:08,318
drift and I'm really not that's one

1380
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,400
thing I'm looking forward to finding out

1381
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:11,838
what are the common problems I know some

1382
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,599
people run into issues with getting

1383
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,838
their system clogged or dirty or maybe

1384
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,680
running they're trying to run too many

1385
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:22,639
organic nutrients or just stuff that

1386
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:24,679
gets gunky in the lines but I really am

1387
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,358
not sure what my problems are going to

1388
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:29,639
be so far in my

1389
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:35,119
experience I found that as long as I

1390
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:37,318
keep my EC and my PPM dialed in in that

1391
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,119
Reservoir that's the main thing that I'm

1392
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:42,558
worrying about really this flood and

1393
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:45,720
drain system has been a dream it's been

1394
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,599
so easy for me and I don't want to curse

1395
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:49,598
myself but it's been very very

1396
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,200
hassle-free I haven't really had much of

1397
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:55,640
any problems to speak of and the plants

1398
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,798
just grow so fast and they grow so big

1399
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:00,318
they have

1400
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:02,519
like such constant almost constant

1401
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,679
availability to nutrients I'm happy that

1402
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,199
it's been so easy for you you know

1403
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:08,558
you're saying those words and I feel the

1404
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:10,798
same way about deep tic culture I grew

1405
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,798
in soil for 14 years and I just did my

1406
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,559
first run actually have it in flowering

1407
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,038
here in a 2x4 and it's been so easy sure

1408
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,880
there's a little stumbled at first

1409
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:23,000
trying to figure things out getting the

1410
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,640
pH kind of dialed in the EC water

1411
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,480
temperature is another thing that that I

1412
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:31,598
look at but once you figure those things

1413
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,639
out it's been so easy for me for most of

1414
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,880
the grow because of all that so yeah I

1415
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:37,639
feel the same way about my hydroponic

1416
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,519
system that you feel about yours are you

1417
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:43,639
running any uh beneficial bacteria in

1418
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:45,798
your uh flood and drain I mean in your I

1419
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:47,920
mean in your deep water culture no just

1420
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:50,838
the nutrients in there with an AirStone

1421
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,159
that's it same here awesome so as we get

1422
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:55,639
towards the end of the episode here one

1423
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,639
of the questions I like to ask folks is

1424
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,480
can you name off the top three strains

1425
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:01,879
that you've grown and what you liked

1426
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,838
about them let me see I haven't grown

1427
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,160
too many at home but let me try to think

1428
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,920
of something that we're at home one that

1429
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:10,920
I really liked was uh Kush mins from

1430
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,760
exotic genetics it was uh really dense

1431
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:18,480
really pretty really nice crazy uh dark

1432
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,760
purple Hues flavorful real nice it was

1433
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,039
very

1434
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,319
photogenic uh the Money Ball which is

1435
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:26,920
the one I did in the flood and drain

1436
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,599
down in the kitchen here

1437
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,838
that was from uh oh the first one I said

1438
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,318
Kush was from exotic that was actually

1439
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,239
from

1440
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:40,159
ethos the Money Ball was exotic genetics

1441
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:43,558
that was a Gary Payton Gary Poppins

1442
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:46,358
cross and that one was just super super

1443
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:49,640
Frosty it had some really big nugs that

1444
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:51,358
I lost to Bud rot but it was so Frosty

1445
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,558
and then another one that was amazing

1446
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,480
was one called orange herana that we

1447
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:59,000
used to grow in this uh commercial

1448
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,920
facility worked in probably one of the

1449
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,920
has to be one of the top three craziest

1450
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:06,240
smelling tarpine profiles I've ever

1451
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,400
smelled before it smells like just pure

1452
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:13,118
candy it does not smell like a plant at

1453
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:16,720
all it smells like a sugar purple

1454
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,519
candy very nice though and huge huge fat

1455
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,159
nugs on it I'll have to check those out

1456
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:22,719
I haven't grown any of those and yeah

1457
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:24,639
this is a question that I've just

1458
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,598
actually started asking about I don't

1459
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,440
know half a dozen episodes or so and

1460
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:30,400
seems like the audience really likes to

1461
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,679
hear about what their favorite genetics

1462
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,920
are and I've had some people in the

1463
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,719
comments are like yeah I just picked

1464
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,440
some up because I'm so stoked of what

1465
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,439
I've heard you know about it blah blah

1466
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,119
blah so thanks for sharing that oh of

1467
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,679
course so wrapping things up here can

1468
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:43,119
you tell the listeners how they can find

1469
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:46,919
you and what you have upcoming in the

1470
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,559
future I got a few different series

1471
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,559

1472
