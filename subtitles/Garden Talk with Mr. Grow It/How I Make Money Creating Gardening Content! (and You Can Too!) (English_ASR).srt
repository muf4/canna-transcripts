1
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,679
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,759
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,279
aka mr grudd and welcome back to my

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,480
channel one of the questions that i get

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,199
every once in a while

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,719
is how do i earn money from the content

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,358
that i create a lot of you that are

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,079
watching this

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
are familiar with my content on my other

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,479
channel my main youtube channel

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,198
i show plants that are non-advertiser

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,519
friendly

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
according to youtube and so no ads are

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,879
displayed on that channel

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
or i think now i think they changed it

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,359
so ads can still be displayed

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
but they pocket 100 of the money i don't

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,759
get anything

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
so how do i actually earn money from the

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,640
content that i create well there's a

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,079
couple ways to do it

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
one of the most common ones is

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
sponsorships so every once in a while

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,878
a company will reach out to me and

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
they'll mention that they want to get

26
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,320
their product or service

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,719
some exposure and if i feel like that

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,439
product or service is a good fit for

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
me my channel my audience then i'll work

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,159
so

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,000
to deal with them whether it be getting

32
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,959
that product in exchange for the

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,799
promotion

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,719
or a paid sponsorship but when you're

35
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
just starting out when your channel is

36
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,719
small for example when you don't really

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,039
have an

38
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,158
audience sponsorships really don't come

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
around that often

40
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,600
so an alternative to that and something

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
i want to talk about in today's video

42
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,719
is affiliate programs and there's one

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
particular affiliate program that i want

44
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,519
to talk about

45
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
which is the happy hydro affiliate

46
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,719
program so first off how do affiliate

47
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,478
programs work

48
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
quite simply what you would do is you

49
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,400
would sign up to their affiliate

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
program you would be able to create

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
custom links

52
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,599
to products that they have on the

53
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,279
website then when you create content

54
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,839
you would actually provide a link

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,359
whether it be in the youtube description

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
uh instagram bio facebook tweeting out

57
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,438
the link

58
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
et cetera et cetera and so a lot of

59
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,359
people create content on specific items

60
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
or they'll just show their plants and

61
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,920
then the products are kind of shown in

62
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
the background or they're using the

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
product

64
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
and then they'll link to that product so

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
that the viewers that people are

66
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,599
watching it

67
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
can actually click on that link and find

68
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,319
out more about that product and

69
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
potentially buy that product now if the

70
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,199
viewer clicks on the link and ends up

71
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
buying that product

72
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
the affiliate would get a percent

73
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,759
commission so say you sign up to the

74
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,159
affiliate program

75
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
you create a youtube video and you're

76
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,840
trimming your plants

77
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
then in the description of the video you

78
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
link to the trimmers that you used

79
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,439
the viewer then has the capability to

80
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,959
click on that link potentially buy that

81
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,520
product and then you get a commission

82
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,039
percent

83
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
so i know all of you are familiar with

84
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,959
amazon some of you may not know that

85
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,439
they actually have an affiliate program

86
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
as well

87
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
i'm a part of their affiliate program i

88
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
do have amazon links

89
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,399
in the description of my videos and it

90
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,679
works the same way as the happy hydro

91
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
one if somebody were to click on that

92
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
link

93
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,079
buy a product then i would get a percent

94
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,439
commission now with amazon

95
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
they used to have their commission set

96
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,840
to eight percent so

97
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
sell a hundred dollar item for example i

98
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
would get eight percent which is eight

99
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
dollars

100
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,439
this year they actually drastically

101
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,360
reduced what their commission amount is

102
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,039
for items in the gardening

103
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
category so instead of being eight

104
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,199
percent it's now three percent which is

105
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
significantly lower than the whale is

106
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,958
before

107
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
one of the main reasons why i like the

108
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
happy hydro affiliate program is because

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
it's higher than that three percent it's

110
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
actually they started

111
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,359
five percent uh commission for uh sales

112
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,360
through their affiliate program

113
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,440
so me linking to happy hydro instead of

114
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
amazon i'm earning more money and i

115
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,560
didn't just join the happy hydro

116
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,000
affiliate program to earn more money

117
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,519
i joined because happy hydro has

118
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
actually been a company that has been

119
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,959
supporting me

120
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
for three plus years now for those of

121
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
you been subscribed to my channel for a

122
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,158
while

123
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,439
you may remember back 2017 i think even

124
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:34,000
into 2016 i did have

125
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,959
sponsored videos with happy hydro in it

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,479
so they've been there since the

127
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,719
beginning for me

128
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,399
they also support other influencers a

129
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,359
ton of influencers here

130
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
on youtube instagram they send out free

131
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
products

132
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
it's a small business that is very

133
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,759
focused on

134
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
customer service they want to make sure

135
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,639
their customer is satisfied

136
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
and they also want to make sure that

137
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,598
customer gets the best price so me

138
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,079
personally

139
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,438
i would much rather support a small

140
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
business like that

141
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,000
over amazon i don't actually have any

142
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,158
ownership of happy hydro

143
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,039
the actually the owner's name is chris

144
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,039
also

145
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,318
and some people got confused in the past

146
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,438
to say oh i thought you're the owner of

147
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,359
happy hydro

148
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,280
no that's not the case i have no

149
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
ownership of happy hydro at all

150
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
i'm simply a part of their affiliate

151
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,879
program but having worked closely with

152
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,199

things like that

155
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,519
i can tell you that this is a company i

156
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280

158
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,758
that being said for anyone who's

159

they're going to gather a little bit of

173
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,879
personal information from you so

174
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
first name last name phone number field

175
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,680
looks like that's optional

176
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
and then country you're in the way that

177
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
they pay out their affiliates is through

178
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,439
paypal

179
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,719
so you're entering your paypal email

180

181
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,039
conditions there

182
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,720

184

user defined fields is what it's titled

188

they may reach out to you and

197
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,719
potentially work more closely with you

198
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,839
on either paid sponsorships or send out

199

free items

200
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,038
so on and so forth then you would enter

201
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,560

the sign up page down in the description

204
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,879
section below

205
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,478
if you have any questions on the

206
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,000
affiliate program whatsoever leave them

207
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,120
in the comment section below and if

208
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
there's any questions that i can't

209
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,439
answer

210
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
i'll have somebody from happy hydro come

211
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,959
on and start replying to comments

212
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
that's pretty much all i want to cover

213
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,959
in this video i know there are more and

214
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,360
more people starting to create content

215
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,159
in this community and not being able to

216
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,038
monetize

217
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,479
through youtube is certainly a barrier

218
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,599
so this affiliate program that i just

219
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,560
talked about

220
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
is an alternate way to try to earn money

221
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
for your work

222
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,120
i know this information isn't useful for

223
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,119
everybody who subscribed to my channel

224
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,199
but i do know that there are some out

225
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
there that this information will benefit

226
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
and of course feel free to share this

227
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
video if you know of anybody who this

228
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
information would help

229
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,399
click that thumbs up button if you

230
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,038
haven't already and i'll leave it at

231
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,120
that

232
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,680
thank you so much for watching and until

233
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
next time

234
