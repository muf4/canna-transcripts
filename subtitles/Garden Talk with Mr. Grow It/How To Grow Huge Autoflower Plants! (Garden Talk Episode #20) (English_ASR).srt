1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
before when i first got into autoflowers

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,519
i was all about hps lights i absolutely

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
love them i did try some leds back in

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
the day and i really didn't really like

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the quality of buds that i was getting

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,760
nowadays i've switched completely over

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,320
100 to leds and i probably never looking

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,560
back to hps it's a completely different

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,039
ball game when you do it outside times

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,919
to finish are definitely not the same

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,239
once you start going over 86 or up to

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,079
90s the autoflowers definitely take a

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,119
little bit of a hit and

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
they

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,839
will not grow as fast the autoflowers

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,558
are very sensitive to nutrients they can

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,440
get overfed very easily well actually

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,679
depends on the genetics too that is one

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,039
of the best ways to get like nice solid

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,840
hard dense

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,840
rock hard buds

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520

00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,399
and uh

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,439

90
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,878
you started 2015

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,959
back in the day in like

92
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,799
2010 2011 that was back in like poop in

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
the bucket days where people tell each

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,439
other oh yeah you can poop in a bucket

95
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,119
or

96
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,199
pee on your plants like there was some

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
crazy information out there but

98
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,399
yeah we definitely come a long way

99
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,679
so for those that don't know who you are

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
can you tell us a little bit about

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
yourself and kind of how you got into

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
gardening

103
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,798
uh yeah uh

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
my channel actually i had a channel

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
before and i just deleted it and started

106
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,560
a new one that was dr autoflower i

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
started that back in 2011.

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
uh

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
some would say i'm one of the originals

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,879
but uh i think the more the the real

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,359
original started like as soon as youtube

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:06,000
started back in like 2005 2006 and uh

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
yeah like i first started pretty much

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
back in the day

115
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,039
my ex-girlfriend her dad had a really

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
nice setup

117
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,000
and he said yeah you can just grow some

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
plants and see how it works for you and

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,279
gave me some seeds i had no idea what

120
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,159
those seeds were

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,039
and it actually was a

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
type of autoflower they i had no idea

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
what i was growing back then

124
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,240
and they just started flowering out of

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
nowhere and i was like what's going on

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
it doesn't make sense and i i thought

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,960
they were just

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,840
just regular plants just doing the thing

129
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,279
but i

130
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,119
noticed like hey these are actually

131
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,719
forming some decent buds what's going on

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
here i have it on

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
20 hours of light so i did some research

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
and

135
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,478
turns out they were autoflower i don't i

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
don't think they're actually full

137
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,159
autoflower but

138
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,758
they were autoflower for sure and that's

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,199
what kind of led me on the journey of

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
autoflowers

141
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,000
and i started doing tons of research

142
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,240
back then probably the best source of

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,439
information was on forums

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,199
and i was just like a complete sponge of

145
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,959
knowledge and i was just super addicted

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,960
to like just wanting to learn and

147
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,038
research as much as possible

148
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,758
so i was learning from everyone else

149
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,519
who's been growing them for the past

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
back then it was only like

151
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,719
a few years when they were actually good

152
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,879
quality

153
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
uh but yeah learned a lot from the

154
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,800
forums and then i

155
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,240
thought wouldn't that be a good idea to

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
kind of

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
give back to the universe or whatever

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
and just like put all that information i

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,240
learned but online on youtube

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,560
in an easier

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,160
form of you know information

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,759
and uh

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,800
in a different i guess medium or

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
whatever

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,319
but uh yeah i

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
i had no idea this could lead to a

167
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,439
career

168
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
uh back then and

169
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,719
yeah it's

170
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
pretty crazy how far we've come

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
so

172
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,679
yeah that's how i kind of got started

173
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,000
with autoflowers and

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
from there i just

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,478
wanted to learn more and uh

176
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,399
produce more content so

177
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,079
yeah here we are today

178
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,918
that's awesome yeah before we started

179
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,918
recording uh he had mentioned that he's

180
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
been gardening for 13 years

181
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,318
and you know you grow a variety of

182
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,479
different plants right so tomatoes herbs

183
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,759
you mentioned peas carrots

184
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,399
lettuce on top of the medicinal so um

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,879
lots of experience across multiple types

186
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,279
of plants which is pretty cool so yeah

187
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,478
yeah like i was telling uh mr growit

188
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,038
here uh

189
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,120
the soil i use now if i instead of just

190
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,000
throwing it out after

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,519
my use uh indoors i'll just move it to

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,038
my outdoors because that's where i use

193
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,038
all my uh regular plastic pots i i've

194
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,879
moved over to like air pots and smart

195
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:52,159
pots so all my olds my old plastic pots

196
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,680
that'll that's what i grow my uh outdoor

197
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
vegetables and that kind of stuff with

198
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,879
so yeah it keeps me keeps me busy and a

199
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
little fun thing to do because i do live

200
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,879
in an apartment so growing here is a

201
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
little bit different i can't just go you

202
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,879
know grow in the soil here

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,598
don't have that many options so yeah

204
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,519
that is what i like to do nice nice

205
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,360
so in this episode in particular i'd

206
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,598
like to talk all about

207
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,919
maximizing yield on all the flowers

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,839
right so how do you grow huge autoflower

209
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,359
plants and you have a track record of

210
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,879
growing big autoflower plants that may

211
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
not have seen your videos so you've been

212
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
doing it for years and years and years

213
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
so i figured you'd be a great person to

214
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
come on to the podcast today and and

215
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,439
talk about your style of doing it so

216
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,360
we've got a list of questions here uh

217
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,759
i've given those to you ahead of time

218
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
for those viewers that don't know uh the

219
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,360
guests are given a list of questions in

220
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,439
advance so they can kind of get an idea

221
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
for what's going to be asked

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
and so we'll go through each thing we'll

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,399
go through nutrition we'll go through

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
lighting we'll go through environment

225
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,439
all these different factors that impact

226
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,680
yield

227
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,160
let's start with medium

228
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
so what medium do you usually grow in

229
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,439
are you in soil cocoa are you doing

230
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,959
hydro

231
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,120
what do you do for that

232
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,878
i've pretty much done everything other

233
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,399
than hydro

234
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
um

235
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,439
so i've used like kind of you know not

236
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,799
the best just regular bag soil and stuff

237
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,199
i've used soil from our

238
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
over at my farm my family farms it's

239
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,038
like compost pretty much

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
so i've used that

241
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,360
um

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,519
but i've

243
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,598
i've pretty much gone

244
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,478
and like stayed with um

245
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,479
pro-mix hp that's the most

246
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,559
you know abundant

247
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,919
good soil i have around everything else

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,879
is you know kind of mediocre compared

249
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,718
i have gone higher cocoa

250
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,879
and uh

251
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
i've used low quality cocoa really

252
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,278
didn't like that had bad results

253
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,039
really got kind of turned off from it

254
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,399
uh but i had also awesome results by

255
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,439
mixing

256
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,759
two parts pro mix and one part cocoa

257
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
like good quality high quality cocoa

258
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,399
i really really enjoyed growing with

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
that

260
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,000
but

261
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,958
uh because hydro stores aren't really

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
you know

263
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,879
close to me uh it's just much easier to

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
stick with pro-mix i have awesome

265
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,720
results with it

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,680
why fix what's not broken so i just kind

267
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,160
of stay with them and uh have awesome

268
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,399
results are you know gotcha and so that

269
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,600
pro-mix hp

270
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,120
uh that's the one that comes with

271
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,519
mycorrhizae right are you adding

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
anything else in are you amending sort

273
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,080
of amending anything else and to begin

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,879
with

275
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,720
no like while when i was doing organic

276
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,559
um i've grown grown with guy green and i

277
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,120
forget the other one but

278
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,879
uh that's the only time i've ever added

279
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,919
stuff into the soil

280
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,559
um

281
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,679
pretty much now i use all advanced

282
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,159
nutrients

283
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,439
for my nutrients so i don't really need

284
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,360
to

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
to have

286
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,639
additives i find

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,720
so i i pretty much keep it like before i

288
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,399
was i don't know i'd get

289
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,399
really technical with all my growing i

290
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,720
uh like i would

291
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,360
add some stuff at the beginning i forget

292
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
what it did i i can't it's been so long

293
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
since i don't even remember what i was

294
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,559
adding back then

295
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,278
but i kind of keep it with the kiss

296
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,159
method keep it simple stupid

297
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,958
just the easier the better and if it

298
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,199
works don't fix it kind of thing yeah i

299
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,199
mean you can still maximize yield with

300
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
simple techniques right a lot of people

301
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,120
yeah

302
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,360
yeah a lot of people do try to um do

303
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,278
more than they need to do

304
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,079
yeah you know micromanaging in a sense

305
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,240
so

306
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,958
um okay cool

307
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,000
and then what drill pot size do you

308
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,958
usually start in and what type of pot do

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,759
you use plastic fabric air uh for a

310
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,719
while there i was using three gallon but

311
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,360
i have now switched over to five gallon

312
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
i really like it um that's probably the

313
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,759
max i like to go i've gone bigger like

314
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,159
10 gallon pots and it just seems like

315
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,399
you're doing too much work for

316
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,679
not that much big of a difference with

317
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,799
all the flowers

318
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,599
so

319
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,679
yeah i i always recommend five gallon

320
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
three three gallons good too

321
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,639
if you don't have all that room or you

322
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
don't want to use so much soil uh but

323
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,399
for me

324
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,159
i

325
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,480
like to stick with five gallon

326
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,039
okay and are those the

327
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,879
air pots or the plastic pots i'm sorry i

328
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,679
don't know those are

329
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,559
i kind of do a mix uh sometimes i do air

330
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,159
pods sometimes i do smart pots air pots

331
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,078
are a little annoying to work with

332
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,838
because water can just like run out the

333
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,000
sides super easy and stuff and then you

334
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,160
gotta suck up all the water that runs

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
off into your catcher

336
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,000
but i would say

337
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,040
yeah i really enjoy going with smart

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,879
pots now uh it just seems like you get

339
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,599
better growth all around especially

340
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,078
compared to like my old plastic bots so

341
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,759
yeah definitely recommend those yeah i

342
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,519
mean it helps you know you do need

343
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,039
oxygen down in that root zone and that

344
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,159
does help with growth you know that's

345
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,480
one of the reasons why a lot of people

346
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,879
go with cocoa because it adds a adds

347
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,039
that air into the the root zone so

348
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,360
pro pro-mix is a light

349
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,879
lighter medium when you compare to soil

350
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
too yeah you're going to get that air in

351
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,120
there and that along with the

352
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,239
either air pots or the fabric pots

353
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,759
that's going to help with aeration

354
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
that's going to help with with overall

355
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,000
growth so yeah if i did have access to

356
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,919
some good high quality cocoa if i didn't

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,919
have to order online pay for shipping

358
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,240
all that i definitely would use it

359
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,799
because you do get more air you do have

360
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
to water a little bit sooner

361
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,000
but

362
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,879
you get a bit better results than just

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,159
using uh pro mix hp so yeah i would

364
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,919
definitely recommend

365
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,159
uh a mix

366
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,078
if if someone else was interested in

367
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,159
getting into like my kind of

368
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,120
uh style medium and stuff definitely a

369
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,719
mix is good gotcha and then one of the

370
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,278
most debated

371
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,120
pieces of this is

372
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,278
starting in the final container there's

373
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,759
people out there who

374
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,439
argue that you need to you should start

375
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,799
in the final container right so you had

376
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
mentioned three gallon grill pots five

377
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,159
gallon grill pots

378
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,720
a lot of people say plant that seed

379
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,240
directly into that medium avoid the

380
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
transplanting process is what they're

381
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,879
trying to do

382
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
because if you're starting in the small

383
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,759
solo cup for example and transplanting

384
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,159
up there is that risk of transplant

385
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,720
shock happening slowed growth happening

386
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,199
with autoflowers during a limited life

387
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,440
right so if you have any um stunning

388
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
growth for the first 30 days or so or

389
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
any any point of grow actually it could

390
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,159
negatively impact yield most likely it's

391
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,079
gonna negatively impact yield um now do

392
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,879
you start in the final container or are

393
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,838
you

394
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,838
transferring a person yeah like you said

395
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,040
nothing's like written in stone right

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,040
like i have seen some decent grows very

397
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,759
good grows that have been transplanted

398
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,078
it can be done it's just like you said

399
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,360
like there is that chance and it the

400
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,799
chance is pretty high that you're going

401
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
to stunt the growth

402
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,479
so

403
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,800
i personally started directly in the pot

404
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,839
don't mess with it starting five gallon

405
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,679
if you're going to do three gallons

406
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,519
start in three gallon but just keep it

407
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,239
as that and uh

408
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,959
yeah you're way less likely to get risk

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
of

410
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,879
shock or anything

411
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,360
but one caveat is um

412
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,519
i've seen that um

413
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
growing outdoors

414
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,159
it's it i i think it's fine you you can

415
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,838
actually can have better results i found

416
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,278
like i've tried both i've tried planning

417
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
directly in the ground

418
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,399
and

419
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,039
just uh dixie cups

420
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,919
one week old and then transplant them

421
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,480
but i definitely noticed that the ones

422
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,120
planted directly outside didn't fare as

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
well for like up here in canada i get

424
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,198
some cold nights so it kind of hurt them

425
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,278
i would suspect

426
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,519
but once they had some

427
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,519
you know they were taken off a bit they

428
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
could actually handle it so

429
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
i actually

430
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,039
had pretty decent results when

431
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
transplanting outside because it seems

432
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,439
like it's a completely different ball

433
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,078
game when you do it outside times to

434
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,639
finish are definitely not the same

435
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,039
a 60 day strain will not

436
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
especially where i am it will not finish

437
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,838
in 60 days

438
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,759
but they can get way bigger than normal

439
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,879
they they have a huge root mass area if

440
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,919
you just plant them directly in the

441
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,559
ground some good soil their roots get

442
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,919
gigantic and i've i've grown like

443
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,159
probably the biggest autoflowers i've

444
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,159
ever grown and i transplant them but

445
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,198
they didn't finish so i didn't really

446
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,600
you know

447
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,559
get the uh you know cream of the cropper

448
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
or whatever

449
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,879
a good harvest but uh

450
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,758
definitely grew some massive mass of

451
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,958
plants

452
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,560
so

453
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,198
did it stunt it

454
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,359
i don't think so i think it was more

455
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,240
environmental issues that i had to deal

456
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,680
with but it just seems like outdoor

457
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,039
they can handle transplant more because

458
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,799
planted directly

459
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,278
they don't have the best start i would

460
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,879
say gotcha gotcha and there's going to

461
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,240
be people that comment on this video and

462
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,679
they're going to say i transplant autos

463
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,600
every time and i don't have any stunt

464
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,958
growth that's a myth the whole

465
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,839
transplanting slows down growth and

466
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,919
stuff so uh either way if you're new to

467
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,839
autoflowers maybe try both and see which

468
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,559
one you like that's what i say it is

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,720
definitely an experiment like everything

470
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,439
you should see as an experiment if you

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,079
want try one plant directly the other

472
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,639
one transplant if it's the same genetics

473
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,239
if you get awesome results still then do

474
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,600
what's easy for you that's what i say

475
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,839
and if you're gonna go the transplant

476
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
route maybe you know when you do that

477
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,639
transplant a common technique is a

478
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,399
sprinkle mycorrhizal fungi on the roots

479
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
as they're doing the transplant so that

480
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,839
way it's basically like an extension of

481
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,919
the root so the fungi extends the roots

482
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
helps the nutrient uptake yeah and some

483
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,278
people swear by that that people are

484
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
like oh i start in the small cup so i

485
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,519
can do that sprinkle of the mycorrhizae

486
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,959
and then they go into their final pot

487
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,078
yeah and then it just blows up from

488
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,439
there so

489
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,838
there are so many different ways to kind

490
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,680
of go about that for sure yeah yeah find

491
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,798
what works best for you and stick with

492
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,359
it yup now how about water what type of

493
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:11,279
water are you typically using when you

494
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,798
grow auto flowers tap rain distilled uh

495
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,038
yeah like i have used uh when doing it

496
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,639
outdoors i have used rain and seemed to

497
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,439
work really good

498
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,079
but here in my apartment building i do

499
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,319
just just water i don't

500
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,318
i don't purify it or whatever i don't

501
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,558
really have a setup for that i would i

502
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,319
would love to if i had my own house

503
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,480
get something set up like that but uh

504
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,759
yeah just straight tap water let it sit

505
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,279
out for a day

506
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,160
decor decolonize and uh

507
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,319
yeah

508
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,200
pretty much uh

509
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,279
i don't really ph it or anything

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
uh well actually i do ph it just a

511
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,119
little bit

512
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,240
just so it gets close to like the

513
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:57,119
7.0 ph mark and then i use ph perfect so

514
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,200
i don't really worry about ph but yeah

515
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,359
just straight old tap water settle for a

516
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
day okay cool and then kind of getting

517
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,359
into the nutrition side of things you

518
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,960
mentioned for nutrients using advanced

519
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,479
nutrients is that typically what you use

520
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,319
when you're trying to maximize yield

521
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,279
with autoflowers is the advanced

522
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,599
nutrient lineup uh yeah like i i've used

523
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,399
a lot of nutrients before i've had also

524
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,798
awesome results with remo's nutrients

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
shout out to remo

526
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,679
but

527
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,519
yeah i've kind of just switched to

528
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,798
because i noticed before a lot of my

529
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,240
issues if i did have issues was normally

530
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,400
from ph

531
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,599
issues just imbalances

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,559
and it just got annoying chasing the ph

533
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,519
because my ph here can get pretty high

534
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:44,000
and it's just annoying to deal with so

535
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,798
once switching to ph perfect i

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,839
kind of stopped having ph problems and

537
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,240
yeah getting awesome results still and

538
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,519
good quality bud so i'm happy with it

539
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,519
and uh

540
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,319
keeping it simple and

541
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,400
yeah still getting awesome results so

542
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,000
i'm pretty pretty pretty happy with it

543
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,759
and you mentioned you're just using the

544
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,359
base nutrients for advanced nutrients i

545
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,679
think they have a couple different bases

546
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,038
right they have like a grill and uh

547
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,360
which ones are you using i actually

548
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,679
don't use the base nutrients i

549
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,439
found a pretty decent uh

550
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,600
kind of

551
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,160
what you would call it a grow schedule

552
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,879
feeding schedule or whatever online and

553
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,519
it uses the uh was it the scentsy bloom

554
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,280
because the scentsy bloom is really it's

555
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,720
got like enough

556
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,440
uh

557
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,160
nitrogen that can last the whole grow

558
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
so a lot of people have shown like you

559
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,320
can just get awesome results just using

560
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,200
that the whole way through

561
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,639
uh

562
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
and yeah

563
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,080
plants seem to love it they don't get

564
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,678
super

565
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,839
they don't like run out of nitrogen

566
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,200
halfway through the the flower cycle so

567
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,599
it's definitely

568
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
a good all-around nutrient to use i'd

569
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,240
say and i'm looking at it right now so

570
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,759
there's scentsy grow looks like there's

571
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,759
two bottles for scentsy grow and then

572
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,000
there's scentsy blooms sensei bloom is

573
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,440
the only one to use yeah those a and b

574
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
wow yeah okay

575
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,038
and are you following a feeding chart

576
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,440
off of their website

577
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,400
no the one i follow i forget what it's

578
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,519
called

579
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
um

580
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,839
but if you search scentsy bloom

581
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,240
uh schedule autoflower it should pop up

582
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,839
it's on a form there but it's pretty

583
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
much um

584
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,158
it's i think it's more less than half of

585
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,319
what they recommend or maybe even one

586
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,640
third of that

587
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,558
but yeah it's definitely much less than

588
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,840
they recommend for their regular plants

589
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,639
and

590
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,319
it seems to do you know it's it's on the

591
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
level of like almost being too much

592
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,918
sometimes so i even go like a little bit

593
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
less

594
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,320
so

595
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,119
like let's say the beginning of feeding

596
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,200
during veg my very first feeding i'd

597
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,759
probably give um

598
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,360
like 1.5 milliliters

599
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,240
of each a and b

600
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,000
or

601
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
two milliliters depending on how the

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,359
plants are looking but yeah it's pretty

603
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,599
small because they i think they

604
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,719
recommend five milliliters when you

605
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,879
first start

606
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
something like that so yeah it is a bit

607
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,600
bit less

608
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,679
okay and then you're not using any

609
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,959
additives on top of that at all any

610
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,440
using any sugars like or any microbial

611
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,679
inoculants or anything i'm using voodoo

612
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,798
juice b52

613
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,240
uh

614
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,599
what is it rhino skin

615
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,759
that kind of helps with the

616
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,719
strengthening of the stalks and stuff i

617
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,319
go

618
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,519
intermittently with the cow mag big buds

619
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,599
and the

620
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,240
the sugar stuff though i i forget what's

621
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,839
called but it has the sugars bud candy

622
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
or something like that yeah but yeah

623
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:48,639
that's pretty much what i use and then

624
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,720
during flower i switch over to the

625
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,400
their flowering additives and then i

626
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,319
kind of take out the

627
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
the veg additives and switch it up a

628
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,839
little bit but yeah i think i might have

629
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:02,558
to do a a video on that on my channel

630
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,199
kind of explain exactly what i use for

631
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,798
the entire growth for autoflowers so

632
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,558
yeah i might have to come up with that

633
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,639
yeah i think that would be very helpful

634
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,558
for sure um yeah so you use some

635
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
additives there's definitely some sugar

636
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,839
in there and like microbes in there

637
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,599
beneficial bacteria and stuff like that

638
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,359
in those bottles that you mentioned so

639
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,038
awesome you're getting yeah the full

640
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,038
nutrition there from

641
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,919
advanced nutrients for sure

642
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,798
and then you said you don't with the ph

643
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,799
nutrients has ph perfect they're

644
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,000
i think it's patented technology or

645
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,519
something that

646
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,558
really when you mix i don't know how it

647
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,720
works

648
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,440
i i asked them how

649
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,279
because my my water can get up to like

650
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,360
9.1 ph wow so pretty high yeah like it's

651
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,558
kind of annoying to deal with so i asked

652
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,038
them like hey

653
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,319
my ph is really high does this work for

654
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,558
mine and they said uh the best thing i

655
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,359
could do is get it down to

656
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,038
7.0 around that

657
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,839
and just

658
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,919
you know just do that the regular

659
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,359
uh nutrients and

660
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
pretty much the way it goes is you add

661
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,240
the

662
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,480
the main like if you're using scentsy

663
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,839
bloom you'd use use uh put sensitive

664
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,038
bloom in first and then all the

665
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,720
additives

666
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,240
um

667
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,038
but what i do now is i found out

668
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,038
uh i i use the

669
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,720
tnb up and down

670
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,079
the the crystals

671
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,279
uh so

672
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,119
i just found out how much i need for 7.0

673
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,960
i can pretty much eyeball it now just

674
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,079
take a little scoop put in there

675
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,279
boom done

676
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,279
and uh

677
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,879
very simple i don't even use a ph pen

678
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,440
anymore there's no point

679
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,600
uh just do that mix up the nutrients

680
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
never had a problem yet pretty much

681
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,199
okay so you are monitoring the ph going

682
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,559
in

683
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,159
some people what they'll do is monitor

684
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,278
the ph of the medium as well whether

685
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,799
that be a runoff test or a slurry test

686
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,919
did you do anything like that at all or

687
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,879
just

688
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,600
i used to but now i keep things so

689
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,799
simple now like it works i'm not having

690
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,719
issues i don't see any ph issues pretty

691
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,720
much anymore so

692
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
i kind of pretty much just stopped doing

693
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,240
that it's just

694
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,558
it takes more time up and

695
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,038
i'd rather keep it as

696
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,000
simple as possible in the garden now

697
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:23,919
gotcha gotcha makes sense now how about

698
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,839
some people monitor the ppm or the ec

699
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,480
of it to know get an idea of how much

700
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,599
nutrients are going into their medium

701
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
do you

702
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,359
monitor the ec or ppm kind of going in

703
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
after you create that mix or coming out

704
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,479
at all or no

705
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,278
i used to

706
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,839
but like i said keeping kiss method

707
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,278
super simple um

708
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,639
i just don't anymore i feed the whole

709
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,558
way through

710
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,320
um that's why i keep it a little bit

711
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,399
less than what they recommend on the

712
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,278
advanced nutrients like calculator you

713
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,159
can put in how much water you're using

714
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,359
and like what growth cycle you're in

715
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,840
they'll tell you how much to use i

716
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,519
usually use like

717
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,158
two thirds of that

718
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:11,200
and i use it throughout the whole grow

719
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,600
and when i get to about week six or

720
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,759
seven start with the flush flush

721
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,439
everything out make sure it's all nice

722
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,599
and clear and

723
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,400
bud's awesome tastes good smoke's

724
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,719
awesome don't have any black ash so okay

725
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,880
so there's nutrition kind of just went

726
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,038
over what you do for that let's switch

727
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
it up and talk about lighting so

728
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,640
arguably one of the most if not the most

729
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
important thing when you're talking

730
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
about yield is

731
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,159
is lighting and getting that energy down

732
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,320
onto the plant if you don't have the

733
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,600
optimal amount of energy

734
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,119
it could yield could definitely be

735
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,959
sacrificed right if you're not giving

736
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,199
enough par

737
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,679
enough of that radiation uh down onto

738
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,038
the plant or too much could harm the

739
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
plant you know you get a light burn it

740
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,960
can slow down growth as well so what are

741
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,880
you typically using what are you using

742
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,679
for lighting in order to maximize yield

743
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,600
good point on uh talking about the like

744
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,000
burning like too much light some people

745
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,199
just think oh more light more lights in

746
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
there the better

747
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,038
no uh that's why i always recommend

748
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,278
people get a par meter or a lux meter

749
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,240
and learn how to convert it from lux to

750
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,880
par

751
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
uh it is definitely needed

752
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,360
uh before when i first got into

753
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,360
autoflowers i was all about hps lights i

754
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,918
absolutely love them

755
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,639
i did try some leds back in the day and

756
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,159
i really didn't really like the quality

757
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
of buds that i was getting

758
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,240
uh nowadays i've switched completely

759
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,960
over 100 to leds and i

760
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
probably never looking back to hps

761
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,679
um

762
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,000
yeah i use optic leds i use the bar

763
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,559
lighting bar lighting seems to become

764
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,558
super popular lately the last two years

765
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,240
or so

766
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,200
many companies are switching over that

767
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
and

768
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,840
the results i'm getting are

769
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
better than what i was getting on hps i

770
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,678
would say

771
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,520
buds are super dense and thick

772
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,278
uh not getting any

773
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,119
weird stretching and stuff back like

774
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,798
you'd get back in the day

775
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,519
um

776
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,359
the terpenes are even better than hps i

777
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,319
would say

778
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:20,000
but yeah i'm super happy since switching

779
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,439
all the way over to leds and uh yeah

780
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
pretty happy with the results i get all

781
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,600
the time

782
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,200
leds have come so far over the years i

783
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,079
mean if we had this conversation back in

784
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
2014

785
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,038
2015-ish

786
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
uh there would be debatable right

787
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,240
there's a huge debate

788
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,959
uh you'd have led grow lights coming out

789
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,720
that are less efficient than hps

790
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,399
so you have these these people

791
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,000
advertising their lights saying that

792
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,558
it's more energy efficient when it's

793
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
actually less energy efficient it was

794
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,639
really bad back in the day when when

795
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,640
leds first kind of came on the market

796
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,360
so days of the blurble

797
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,759
yep days of the the targeted light

798
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,839
spectrum with the the blues and the reds

799
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,759
only and eliminating those greens and

800
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,798
you just see purple and oh man wouldn't

801
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,839
i strain

802
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,679
yes exactly exactly like uh

803
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,480
i remember back in the day

804
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,798
when

805
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
hps was the main thing there were people

806
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,319
they would come on and they would want

807
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,880
to like do like grow battles and stuff

808
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,038
and hey let's do a competition all

809
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,720
i think i can beat you with leds and you

810
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,798
use hps and

811
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,440
there was no competition really like it

812
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,319
was it was not a competition back in

813
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
2012. now 10 years later nine years

814
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,000
later it's

815
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,600
there's no competition comparing hps to

816
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,319
leds now like the energy you save

817
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,678
the heat you like uh

818
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,720
you don't have to deal with all the heat

819
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,038
and stuff

820
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,600
and the light spread is just has gotten

821
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,480
so damn good that it just doesn't make

822
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,240
sense to go with hps anymore yep

823
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
i agree you still get good results off

824
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
of it but um of course definitely more

825
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,519
efficient better light spread with the

826
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,240
leds and so on and so forth now is there

827
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,079
a specific amount of par

828
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,599
that you aim for during this different

829
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,119
stages of growth when you're looking to

830
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,119
maximize yield like i know you said you

831
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,398
have a par meter there are some general

832
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,239
ranges out there which i've mentioned on

833
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,479
my channel many many times of general

834
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,480
ranges that people can aim for during

835
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
the different stages of growth do you

836
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,440
look at that and aim for a certain

837
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,079
amount

838
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,880
oh yeah of course definitely i if anyone

839
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,960
asks i always recommend them

840
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,799
pretty simple like i said before if you

841
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,600
don't have a par meter they're expensive

842
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:33,038
they're like 500 800 i think here in

843
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,519
canada i think 500 or 600 in america or

844
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,839
something like that so they're pricey uh

845
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,440
but a lux meter you can get for like

846
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,839
forty dollars or something like that and

847
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,759
there's a simple conversion you can do

848
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,519
to get par pretty much

849
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:51,440
uh but yeah i recommend um

850
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,558
for autoflowers it's pretty similar to

851
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,480
for veg plants i would see the first

852
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,440
first three weeks would be what you

853
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,798
would give for veg so i would start at

854
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
200 par

855
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,798
and slowly ramp up to about

856
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,038
550 600 par

857
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,359
at the end of uh

858
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,599
veg there once it starts flowering

859
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,558
and during the first week of flower i'll

860
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,079
probably slowly go from

861
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,558
550

862
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:26,240
600 slowly go up until about i would say

863
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:29,038
week 5.5 or 6

864
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,240
like slowly ramp up to about

865
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:34,319
900 850 something like that

866
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,759
that's where i usually see the best

867
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,439
results

868
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,038
but it's it is a slow ramp up and uh

869
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,798
that that is the nice thing about having

870
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,960
a par meter you can actually check every

871
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,879
day say okay it's because your plants

872
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,640
are growing too so you don't always have

873
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,720
to just lower the lights

874
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
so as long as they're you're keeping

875
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,480
your par and it's slowly going up i

876
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,759
think you're doing awesome

877
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,599
and uh

878
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,839
that is one of the best ways to get like

879
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,918
nice solid hard dense

880
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,599
rock hard buds and knowing your par is

881
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,038
very important i say

882
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,639
it's super important especially if

883
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,319
you're giving a lot of people don't

884
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
realize that they're giving the like or

885
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,918
their plants too much

886
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,918
i've had that issue before when i wasn't

887
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,720
using my par meter i was just

888
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,960
cranking up the light and then oh

889
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,440
i go check and my par is at like

890
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,038
600 700 during veg and i'm just like oh

891
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
yeah i'm frying my plants this isn't

892
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,079
good

893
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,879
so yeah definitely something i recommend

894
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,639
people look into gotcha gotcha and then

895
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,120
the higher light levels is pretty much

896
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,159
the same in line to what i aim for right

897
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,199
i'm going

898
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,519
you know 900 max really for flowering is

899
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,600
typically what i go for now if you're

900
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,440
supplementing co2

901
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,480
you can go higher than that in most

902
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,159
cases are you supplementing co2 at all

903
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,079
right now or no uh i was using uh the

904
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,120
kind of like the mushroom bags i forgot

905
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:58,000
what co2 bags or whatever uh i was

906
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,398
cranking up the leds a little bit more i

907
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,759
was going up to like 950

908
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,398
1000 i didn't notice

909
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,240
light burn really uh they were

910
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,239
i think

911
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,919
if someone asked me like how much does

912
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,720
it actually help i would say

913
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,799
maybe five percent better growth i i

914
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,679
don't i don't see it as like a huge

915
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,278
amount but if i actually had a real co2

916
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,759
setup yeah i would definitely be going

917
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,398
higher um i've heard of people going up

918
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:29,119
to like uh 1200

919
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:32,558
uh par or sometimes even higher than

920
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,639
that um but i don't have a

921
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,519
uh co2 set up like that so i haven't

922
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,360
really got into it um i do grow pretty

923
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,079
much right next to our bedroom pretty

924
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,639
much so i don't really want co2 all

925
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,079
throughout the house and stuff so

926
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
yeah maybe one day when we have

927
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,759
something separate um i would like to

928
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,278
get into co2 a bit more gotcha so are

929
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,278
you still using mushroom bags or not

930
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:59,038
anymore uh no i i kind of stopped um

931
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,200
made me think like is

932
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,519
is this releasing spores throughout the

933
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,759
house or something like that or

934
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,359
i don't know i didn't really see a huge

935
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,480
huge difference

936
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,240
to

937
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,720
make me want to go spend you know i

938
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,399
think they're around like 60 70

939
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
bag or something like that a little

940
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,959
pricey so yeah i

941
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,679
just thought might as well just not do

942
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,200
it this time gotcha and then when you're

943
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,278
not supplementing since you're not

944
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,278
supplementing co2 air exchange is going

945
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,278
to be super important right because

946
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,119
if you're not exchanging the air the

947
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,359
plants are just eating up that co2 and

948
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,518
the grow tent or grow room whatever

949
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,678
you're in yeah what do you typically do

950
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,159
for air exchange normally i got the

951
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,120
window just wide open fans blowing all

952
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,440
in the outdoor air but this year i'm a

953
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,119
little worried about that because i did

954
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,600
end up with mites

955
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,038
last year so i was super angry about

956
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,959
that

957
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,319
but this year i think i might have to

958
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,200
set up a

959
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:59,359
portable ac unit just so it's sucking in

960
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,200
the air i don't have the window wide

961
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,319
open for bugs to come in

962
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,398
so i think that's probably my best bet

963
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,838
but i do also grow with my my tent doors

964
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,398
just wide open

965
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,519
um i don't really tend to close them all

966
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,118
the time

967
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,519
um

968
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,440
yeah i just feel like the air movement

969
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,280
is just much better when you have it

970
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,559
wide open like that fans blowing

971
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,679
everything around got the uh in intake

972
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,078
fans uh sucking it out but i don't take

973
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,599
my intake fans and put it out the door

974
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,919
because i'm an apartment building

975
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,079
building i don't want people seeing a

976
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,239
bunch of tubes going to the window and

977
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,359
stuff and them wondering what that's all

978
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,479
about so

979
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,480
yeah i keep it pretty low-key um

980
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,280
i would like to have a more proper setup

981
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,519
for

982
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,399
moving air out but here's what it is for

983
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,239
right now

984
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,159
gotcha are you running into any

985
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,519
temperature issues the way you're doing

986
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,960
that or what's the temperature you

987
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,630
usually aim for

988
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,599
uh

989
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,400
[Music]

990
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,119
well going with leds i normally would

991
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,639
want it around like 80

992
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,559
80 fahrenheit to about 85 is tops i

993
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,960
would like to have it at uh and that's

994
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,239
the canopy temperature yeah canopy yeah

995
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,880
pretty much

996
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,639
try to keep it at that

997
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,119
it does get a little

998
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,879
hard to do sometimes in the

999
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,358
you know dead of

1000
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,039
dead of summer or whatever so like it's

1001
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,199
gets a little intense

1002
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,440
uh because i am an apartment building so

1003
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,239
it does get a little hot in here so that

1004
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,880
makes me think i should probably get a

1005
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,959
ac unit just for

1006
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,358
that one month so it doesn't affect the

1007
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
crop or anything but uh normally during

1008
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,039
winter time i don't really have any

1009
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,280
issues with keeping the temperatures

1010
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,279
down um

1011
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,240
during the winter it kind of helps heat

1012
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,200
my place so that's that's the nice thing

1013
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,799
um

1014
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,679
but yeah try to keep in those

1015
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,480
temperatures once you start going over

1016
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,399
86 or up to 90s the autoflowers

1017
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,199
definitely take a little bit of a hit

1018
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,320
and

1019
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,358
they

1020
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,920
will

1021
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,400
not grow as fast i would say yeah i used

1022
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,119
to go up to 85 87 actually is kind of

1023
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,480
what i maxed out at and some cultivars

1024
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,358
were able to take it

1025
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,320
other cultivars you'd see that stress

1026
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,759
come on

1027
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,920
so i've

1028
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,920
brought it down a notch usually now i'm

1029
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
actually aiming for typically leaf

1030
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,960
surface temperature to be like 80 to 82

1031
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,039
degrees and depending on the cultivar um

1032
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
most of them will be able to take that

1033
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,838
and uh and that means that the canopy

1034
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,679
temperature usually is a little bit

1035
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,759
higher than the leaf surface temperature

1036
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,399
it's usually you know two three four

1037
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,680
degrees potentially depending on the

1038
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,680
light you're using and how much it's

1039
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,358
radiating down on there you know the

1040
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,039
amount of ir comes into it we talked

1041
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,759
about we get into a whole discussion

1042
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,679
about hps versus led just as the amount

1043
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,640
of heat that comes down but

1044
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,480
we won't get into that but um yeah okay

1045
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,440
that makes sense for for temperature now

1046
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
what about

1047
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,159
humidity

1048
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,920
uh what do you typically aim for for

1049
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,920
humidity through the different stages of

1050
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,320
growth uh

1051
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,320
really i just try to keep it as low as

1052
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,960
possible i just i don't mess with the i

1053
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,119
i know it's better like the uh what is

1054
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,720
it called the the chart the mac vpd

1055
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,800
like i i have

1056
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,159
tried to go buy that but

1057
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,280
i really

1058
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,239
don't want

1059
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,240
high humidity at all not like none lower

1060
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,358
the humidity for me is the better

1061
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,078
because

1062
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,159
i have had issues with mold in the past

1063
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,560
and this this is during wintertime

1064
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,679
winter time is super important for me to

1065
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,320
like have

1066
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,078
as little as humidity as possible i have

1067
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,519
dehumidifiers

1068
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
trying to keep it as low as possible

1069
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,358
because when you're running four tenths

1070
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,639
it can get kind of high in one room

1071
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:47,679
um

1072
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,440
but

1073
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,559
yeah i've had issues with mold in the

1074
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,639
past where

1075
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,159
here in canada it gets so cold that the

1076
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,719
humidity will start

1077
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,118
creating ice on the windows

1078
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,358
and then start dripping down and stuff

1079
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,920
and dripping down your window and if you

1080
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,000
get too much of that stuff it can be

1081
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,480
really bad ruin

1082
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,358
all the wooden stuff onto the windows so

1083
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,199
i

1084
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:15,358
really don't like humidity at all

1085
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:17,598
anymore and try to stay away from it

1086
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,440
do i see much of a difference with

1087
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,160
growing

1088
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,280
not really um compared to when i've had

1089
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,159
it i like

1090
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,800
really

1091
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,719
perfect humidity i haven't noticed that

1092
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,960
much of a difference so

1093
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,078
i just try to keep it simple

1094
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,119
if it's low humidity and it's doing good

1095
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,560
why not

1096
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,400
just keep it at that and not have to

1097
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,480
worry about molds when you say low

1098
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,519
humidity what percentage around is that

1099
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,199
here

1100
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,480
it's normally around 40

1101
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,799
45

1102
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,320
something like that okay so not critical

1103
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,480
no not there's some places where it's

1104
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,680
like 20 i just really don't want it to

1105
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,280
go up to like 50 55 60 that's when i

1106
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,199
started getting worried and i can start

1107
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,640
seeing condensation on the windows

1108
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,639
summertime i don't have to worry about

1109
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,159
that but i'd rather just have a set up i

1110
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,319
don't have to like mess with every

1111
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:11,759
winter and summer that makes sense and

1112
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,599
vpd you know as it it is optimal as we

1113
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,640
all know you know science has proven

1114
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,240
that that

1115
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,719
vpd is out if somebody who doesn't know

1116
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,959
about vpd you can search that and find

1117
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,799
out a lot more details on that is a good

1118
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,800
article from pulse

1119
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,440
pulse monitor they have a good article

1120
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,039
about vpd what it actually is what the

1121
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,320
different ranges you should aim for

1122
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,400
during the different stages of growth

1123
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,519
there's charts that you can go by

1124
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,599
i've been going after v i've been

1125
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,639
chasing after vpd for the past several

1126
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,240
grows

1127
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,920
and

1128
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,598
you know there definitely seems to be a

1129
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,400
little bit different in growth i would

1130
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,960
say from my experience as far as mostly

1131
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
about like quality blood structure i

1132
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,159
feel like as i'm running low humidity

1133
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,480
like i struggle here i live in the

1134
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,598
desert oh yeah very dry here we're

1135
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,800
looking at 20 natural humidity

1136
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,119
30 natural humidity so if i don't have

1137
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,480
humidifiers pumping things up there

1138
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,480
you know pumping that humidity up and

1139
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,719
getting high i do see impact with growth

1140
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,719
in bud structure um that's just kind of

1141
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,199
my experience but 40 isn't isn't

1142
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,559
critically low and no

1143
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,960
it's not true from my experience there

1144
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,039
isn't a big difference between um you

1145
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,599
know 30 i'm sorry there is not a big

1146
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,480
difference between 40 and like 50 for

1147
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,039
example

1148
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,039
and when you talk about optimal vpd

1149
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,599
specifically in the flowering stage you

1150
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,639
know if you're running the what

1151
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,280
78 to 82 degree range

1152
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,598
you know the high 50s i think i believe

1153
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,680
is the green range for it yeah just on

1154
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,039
the cusp i think but

1155
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:48,078
it works it gets me by um

1156
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,719
yeah like it's it does get really uh

1157
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,880
like like dry like that here too like

1158
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,719
sometimes outdoor humidity is probably

1159
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,559
like the same as yours

1160
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,959
especially during winter time but

1161
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,759
indoors when i got you know

1162
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,318
16 pots five gallon pots full of water

1163
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
and stuff right it does help

1164
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,358
make the humidity in there and uh

1165
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,639
keeps it pretty stable i'd say so yeah

1166
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,519
all right so let's switch it up let's

1167
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,118
talk about plant training techniques so

1168
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,358
um arguably one of those things that can

1169
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,640
impact yield a ton

1170
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,318
i mean there's some websites out there

1171
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,639
that say low stress training alone is

1172
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,358
going to increase yield by 40 percent oh

1173
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,440
yeah particularly with autoflowers

1174
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,199
you know a lot of people do plant

1175
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,760
training techniques because they want to

1176
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,759
maximize yield right um so what plant

1177
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,359
training techniques do you typically do

1178
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,440
for autoflowers uh right off the bat i

1179
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,838
start doing leaf tucking

1180
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440
so just tucking the leaves in any of the

1181
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,400
big fan leaves that you can see that

1182
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,079
kind of can tuck in between the lower

1183
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,400
branches coming out so you can give

1184
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,240
those lower branches a light it really

1185
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,240
helps

1186
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,559
yeah i would say the more low stress

1187
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,479
training the better

1188
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,799
some people get really into it really

1189
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,880
just tie them down every place they can

1190
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,720
and the more you can do it the better

1191
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,800
your results are going to be the more

1192
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,078
light that can penetrate through to the

1193
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,000
lower branches and uh it's it's it's

1194
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,160
definitely going to help

1195
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,838
i've done it where i just don't do any

1196
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,000
training at all compared to when i do

1197
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,400
lots of training lots of training always

1198
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,400
produces better results i completely

1199
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,599
agree with you i've grown um now i know

1200
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,280
when you're growing from seed there's

1201
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,400
different phenos different growth blah

1202
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,480
blah blah

1203
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,639
but uh you know growing

1204
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,039
the same cultivar

1205
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,039
i had 10 different plants actually same

1206
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,159
tender from phenos same strain or

1207
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,239
cultivar

1208
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,480
and some i did low stress training on

1209
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,318
some i just grew naturally

1210
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,679
and the ones i grew naturally i believe

1211
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,599
it was uh

1212
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,559
let's see a yield range from like three

1213
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,240
and a half ounces up to i think five

1214
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,239
ounces and then the low storage chain

1215
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,078
ones always produce more than that up to

1216
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,078
eight ounces wow yeah from low stress

1217
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,920
training off off of an auto

1218
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,480
and that was i think the highest yield i

1219
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,400
ever got off of an auto was eight ounces

1220
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,039
and that was with low stress training

1221
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,800
um now what about topping that's one of

1222
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,039
the debatable

1223
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,560
topics on this is people say no high

1224
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,519
stress training techniques at all should

1225
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,880
be done

1226
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,639
for autos or else you're gonna

1227
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,079
negatively impact yield

1228
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,598
topping you know is one of those things

1229
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,640
that are high stress training techniques

1230
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,200
do you

1231
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,400
top auto power plants did you avoid that

1232
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,199
or what uh

1233
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,280
normally i just avoid that i'm not big

1234
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,358
into topping at all

1235
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,319
even for photo periods

1236
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,559
i

1237
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,199
more prefer super cropping but for

1238
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,279
autoflowers i just

1239
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,879
just don't do it i actually have been

1240
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,119
thinking about just trying just for a

1241
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,960
little experiment make a video put it on

1242
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,880
my channel and just show people what's

1243
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,639
the difference use the same genetics

1244
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,000
but normally

1245
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,318
it would take

1246
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,760
what five six maybe seven days to

1247
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,920
recover from that

1248
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,880
which your autoflower could be using to

1249
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,480
produce get like more branches getting

1250
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,519
bigger instead of just trying to heal

1251
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,039
so

1252
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,280
normally i would tell

1253
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,000
a beginner or some just get into

1254
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,760
autoflowers don't top just stick with

1255
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,719
low stress chaining

1256
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,720
and

1257
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,439
but if you're getting more advanced and

1258
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,118
you want to just try it out

1259
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,880
like we were talking about before

1260
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,400
different genetics can handle it better

1261
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,559
it seems like

1262
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,280
i've seen some amazing grows people

1263
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,679
topped it and had awesome results

1264
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,240
i've also seen people top and get bad

1265
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,318
results so it kind of really depends

1266
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,318
depends on how you're growing them to

1267
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,000
depends how big these plants are getting

1268
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,519
like are you growing a small little

1269
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,199
plant that's not going to get more

1270
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,199
bigger than a foot and a half or are you

1271
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,000
growing a plant that's normally can get

1272
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,919
up to

1273
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,400
four feet because there's the super

1274
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,680
autos that get really big and then

1275
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,559
smaller autos that say really small so

1276
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:59,118
i it kind of depends but me personally i

1277
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:00,480
just don't do it i low stress train

1278
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,720
enough that it

1279
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,960
pre creates a like a decent bush and a

1280
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,879
nice canopy right but like you said like

1281
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,920
when you grow just let it do its thing

1282
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,720
and stuff

1283
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,240
the

1284
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,759
plant will normally grow up like a

1285
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,279
christmas tree you'll get some really

1286
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,440
nice buds on top the first you know

1287
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,839
one third of it the rest are kind of you

1288
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
know not that greatest of quality of

1289
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,039
buds

1290
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,519
so when you have a nice canopy and

1291
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,800
you've got way more top buds all getting

1292
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,838
the good light

1293
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,839
it comes out better i'd say yeah i've

1294
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,000
topped autos handful of autos in the

1295
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,239
past and obviously i've grown plants why

1296
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,159
i haven't topped them and

1297
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,519
just every time it's been

1298
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,960
more yield off of the non-topped plants

1299
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,079
that's just my experience and there's

1300
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,838
going to be people in the comments again

1301
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,000
that say they top autos every time and

1302
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:51,440
it doesn't impact growth

1303
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,280
you know maybe i just need to experiment

1304
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,200
more but

1305
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,519
i'm pretty sure i've like accidentally

1306
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,919
topped some too

1307
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,079
the results came out good but that the

1308
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,240
question is would have would have it

1309
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,000
been better if you just

1310
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,639
not topped it at all and just low stress

1311
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,838
chained until you got a nice big canopy

1312
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,480
that's uh you know all nice and even i

1313
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,759
would say a better big canopy is

1314
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,000
going to give you better results i would

1315
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,760
say yep highly debatable product on

1316
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,358
topping autoflowers versus non-topping

1317
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,640
autoflowers i'd love to know in the

1318
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,799
comments below

1319
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,118
for those that are growing autos do you

1320
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,200
top them let me know your experience

1321
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,559
doing that cool

1322
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,000
and you talked a little bit about

1323
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,838
pulling the branches out do you do

1324
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,159
anything for like plant support you know

1325
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,599
scrub technique anything like that in

1326
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,559
order when you're growing your autos or

1327
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,280
no not really like

1328
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,679
my autos compared to my photo periods

1329
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,480
because i i grow my photo periods a bit

1330
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,679
bigger uh my autoflowers seem to be very

1331
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,318
sturdy i never really need to like

1332
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,679
tie them up or anything or have uh

1333
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,400
stakes

1334
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,759
tie them steaks or whatever or do the

1335
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,920
scrog nets

1336
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,640
uh yeah autoflowers

1337
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,440
the ones i grow uh seem to do really

1338
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,318
good with without so yeah okay

1339
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,679
so

1340
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,519
that being said we kind of went over a

1341
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,759
lot we went over nutrition went over

1342
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,280
lighting over environment

1343
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,400
all for autos and kind of talk about

1344
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,960
things that

1345
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,200
that you do in order to maximize yield

1346
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,838
right so everything being said and every

1347
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,598
all your experience growing autoflowers

1348
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,679
what advice do you have for people who

1349
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,119
are new to growing autoflowers and what

1350
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,639
advice you have for people who are

1351
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,640
trying to maximize yield with

1352
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,159
autoflowers one of the most important

1353
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:35,920
things is start with good genetics of

1354
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,358
course

1355
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,358
stick with some reputable brands um

1356
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,000
the thing with autoflowers is you can

1357
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:46,880
get some not so reputable reputable

1358
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,719
brands and they may not actually be full

1359
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,480
autoflowers i've had that lots in the

1360
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,239
past where you've grown it and it's not

1361
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,079
actually autoflowering and then you have

1362
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,519
to switch it to 12 and 12 light just to

1363
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,200
get the flower

1364
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,280
you kind of know that those genetics

1365
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,480
aren't really you know stable

1366
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,880
uh so i always recommend mephisto

1367
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,199
uh always had great result results with

1368
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,720
them and uh

1369
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,838
like we were talking about in the past

1370
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,919
or in the start there uh start i

1371
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,000
recommend people start in the past

1372
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,519
they're gonna finish in so three gallons

1373
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,679
or five gallons

1374
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,358
uh i recommend that they use a good

1375
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,440
medium

1376
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,119
a lot of people just use

1377
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,039
i don't know some some people just go

1378
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,358
the the hardware store and get some just

1379
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,838
random dirt i don't recommend it i

1380
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,598
recommend getting something good quality

1381
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,480
at least some pro mix

1382
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,119
some good quality cocoa or you know

1383
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,119
there's some other stuff out there

1384
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,519
but definitely stick with some quality

1385
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,519
medium

1386
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,800
and when you're feeding nutrients it's

1387
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,118
don't go by what they're actually

1388
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,920
telling you to go on the bottom the

1389
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,318
bottle uh the instructions it's normally

1390
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,838
at least half or even one third of what

1391
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,599
they're telling you to use

1392
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,679
and because autoflowers are very

1393
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,480
sensitive to nutrients they can get

1394
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:08,799
overfed very easily it seems like well

1395
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,719
actually depends on the genetics too

1396
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
but yeah that uh

1397
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,399
keep your power good make sure you're

1398
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,679
not giving them too much par or too

1399
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,559
little par and uh

1400
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,799
yeah just try to not stress them as much

1401
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,040
as possible if they're not stressed they

1402
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,039
can just take off and do the thing and

1403
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,719
you'll get some awesome results if you

1404
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,480
stress them too much you mess with them

1405
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,118
too much so you can kind of

1406
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,800
kind of stunt the stunt your results

1407
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,240
really good advice there yeah you

1408
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,000
touched on a lot of pieces that are

1409
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,000
really important when it comes to autos

1410
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,519
for sure yeah so how can the listeners

1411
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,880

1412
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,800

coming up i have a new season started

1418
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,519
right now um

1419
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:59,039
we are

1420
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:00,960
i'm just starting some new autoflowers

1421
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,079
right away getting them planted here

1422
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,318
today uh and

1423
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,960
yeah i got some photo periods going too

1424
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:11,119
i do grow a lot of frodo periods and

1425
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,199
mix it up with the autoflowers

1426
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,920
i like to do pheno hunts

1427
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,000
so can't really do that with autoflowers

1428
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,639
as you know as well

1429
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,519
so that's why i kind of stick with

1430
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:26,239
photo periods if i'm doing phenol hunts

1431
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,719
