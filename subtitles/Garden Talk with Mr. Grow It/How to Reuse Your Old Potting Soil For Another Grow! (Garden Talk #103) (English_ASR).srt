00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,799
comes to reusing soil and that's today's

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,800
topic we also get into pH and living

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,140
soil organic fertilizers heavy metals

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,519
and microbial inoculants I want to

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,859
acknowledge that one of my goals for

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,960
this podcast is to bring free gardening

20
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,238
information of all plants to the general

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,280
public that being said I like to thank

the Bovada 58 and 62 humidity packs for

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,238
six years now and they do a fantastic

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,400
job at ensuring my flowers are at the

28
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,319
ideal moisture content their humidity

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,659
packs help maintain a stable environment

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,019
protecting against trichome damage

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:18,380

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,379
have the ion beam s16 which are 16

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,118
inches long and use the same diodes it

43

Talk podcast today I am joined with Tad

53
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,500
Hussey how you doing today great thanks

54
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,318
for having me on the show thanks for

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,479
coming on today we're going to get into

56
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,878
reusing soil so many indoor Growers will

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,919
start off with a bagged soil use it for

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,899
one grow and then they'll either dump in

59
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,780
their backyard or dump into their trash

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,060
literally I know that soil can be reused

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,080
right grow after grow but there are some

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,180
things that you're going to want to do

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,260
with that soil prior to reusing it and

64
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,540
that's really what we're going to get

65
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,280
into in today's episode I also want to

66
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,159
pick your brain on ph and living soil

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,919
Hot Topic for sure organic fertilizers

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,479
heavy metals and microbial inoculants if

69
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
we have time but first what I do with

70
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,899
all guests is an introduction can you

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
tell us a little bit about yourself and

72
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,280
how you got into gardening yeah

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,560
absolutely so I grew up around plants my

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,840
parents owned a nursery and Landscape

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,000
Company on seven acres in Redmond

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,519
Washington so I've been around plants my

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,419
entire life I wasn't really into it

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,340
though growing up until after College I

79
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,399
came back from Australia with a master's

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,900
degree in special education and I was

81
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,019
starting to get a little burnt out on it

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,120
and my my parents had sold their nursery

83
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,039
and Landscape company and started a

84
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,539
business

85
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,878
selling and Manufacturing compost tea

86
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,598
Brewers so I got to start learning about

87
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,939
soil biology and micro microorganisms in

88
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,979
the soil and that really sparked some of

89
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,739
the like the scientists in me and got me

90
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:32,759
back interested in plants and gardening

91
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,060
and then in 2011 we opened a seven Acre

92
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,878
Farm and Feed Store with an organic

93
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,120
Hydro shop outdoor preschool edible

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,679
Nursery we had chickens pigs Ducks goats

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,580
all running around on the property it

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,519
was uh it was a really cool experience

97
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,519
we did that until

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,280
2017 or 2018

99
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,920
when we ended up shutting that down

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,719
during right before covid and now I have

101
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,280
an online business focused around

102
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,500
manufacturing living soils providing

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,620
soil amendments and really working with

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,658
people on how to properly amend and

105
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,180
reuse your soil so you're not just going

106
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:17,219
to the garden center and buying a

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,540
fertilizer for tomatoes because it has a

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,519
picture of a tomato on it but you're

109
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,040
actually looking at like what what is

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,379
what does my soil really need to

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,240
optimize

112
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,680
soil fertility for that plant awesome

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,840
yeah I know you from Kiss organic

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,540
actually have that super soil you have a

115
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,039
lot of good organic products and you

116
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,900
have a lot of knowledge in regards to

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
reusing soil so I'm glad we get to pick

118
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,859
your brain on it today you also are a

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,780
fellow podcaster right you want to talk

120
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,000
a little bit about that one oh yeah I

121
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,698
appreciate that so uh I have a podcast

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,360
it's called Uh cannabis cultivation and

123
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,460
Science and uh it's uh it's a high level

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,220
technical podcast for people who really

125
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,019
want to dive into cultivation you don't

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,180
even have to be growing medicinal plants

127
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,099
we get a lot of gardeners that tune in

128
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,740
too but if you want to hear you know

129
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,060
what some of the latest research is uh

130
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,220
you know so we've actually had some of

131
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,079
the same guests on like uh Bryant Mason

132
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,340
is a good example of that it's sole

133
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,319
doctor Consulting if you haven't

134
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,000
listened to the podcast that you did

135
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,099
with him I definitely recommend people

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,418
check it out

137
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,699
um and then I just launched a new

138
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,219
podcast called uh dope history that's

139
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,100
just kind of capturing the narratives

140
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,960
um purely educational of people in the

141
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,139
industry who came before us that really

142
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,538
like set the tone and I gave up a lot to

143
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,478
to get us to where we are now with our

144
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:38,579
with the legal market so uh yeah those

145
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,319
are two podcasts that I that I have

146
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,599
going right now I haven't had a chance

147
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,740
to tune into the dope podcast but if

148
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,560
it's anything like your other podcast

149
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,300
it's probably a must listen so uh I'll

150
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,339
definitely have to spend some time

151
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,139
listening to to those episodes there

152
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,099
thank you yeah it's totally it's totally

153
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,259
different

154
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,699
um I love the guests we have for season

155
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,538
one I just want to mention we got like

156
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,819
Tommy Chong Ed Rosenthal uh Keith stropp

157
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,860

158
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,139
season one so yeah please do check it

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,939
out all right let's get into reusing

160
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,519
soil we have a lot of folks that are

161
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,139
using synthetic nutrients in their soil

162
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,478
right so first I want to ask can you

163
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,439
reuse soil that synthetic nutrients were

164
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,500
added into

165
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,660
during the past growth cycle if so how

166
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,060
would you go about reusing that soil

167
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,319
yeah that's a that's a great question

168
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,959
um it's a little bit of a complicated

169
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,539
answer so first off I want to say I'm an

170
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,379
organic guy so I I stick to organic

171
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,599
inputs however I'm not

172
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,060
um I'm Not cultish About It by any means

173
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,199
and so for people who are using chemical

174
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,060
nutrients I think there's a couple

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,860
things that get misconstrued on the

176
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,800
organic side and the first one is is

177
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,919
that chemical nutrients or synthetic

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,918
nutrients kill microbes and they ruin

179
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,198
your soil that's just simply not true if

180
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,719
you put out too many and your soluble

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,939
salt levels get too high then yes you

182
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,560
can get osmotic shock that makes it

183
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,959
difficult for the microorganisms to

184
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,579
survive it can damage the roots it's why

185
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:12,379
you don't run High EC anyway with uh

186
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:15,599
with synthetic salts so low levels of

187
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,819
mineral-based nutrients actually are

188
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,039
shown to increase microorganism activity

189
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,500
and have benefits and if you look at

190
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,939
what like the giant pumpkin Growers are

191
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,279
doing for example they're doing a

192
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,439
combination of Organics and synthetics

193
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,799
as a way of like maximizing their yield

194
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,860
so while personally I don't use those

195
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,020
those products I don't by any means just

196
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,120
straight out say that they're bad if

197
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,879
we're looking at it strictly from a soil

198
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,620
fertility perspective so you can

199
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,598
absolutely reuse those soils now the one

200
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,240
thing to be aware of when you go to

201
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,579
reuse those soils if you have the

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,740
capacity to do soil tests that will tell

203
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,899
you what sorts of availability you have

204
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,960
where what nutrients you have at

205
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:01,799
sufficiency and where you may need to

206
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:05,159
reament also if you did apply high

207
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,379
levels like if you ran a full cycle of

208
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,639
just

209
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:12,240
synthetic nutrients chemical nutrients

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,939
you may have soluble salt levels that

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
are above what we want ideally for our

212
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,478
next crop depending on what we're

213
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,560
growing next you know lettuces for

214
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,659
example are going to need a lot less

215
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,959
nutrients than tomatoes or Peppers or

216
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,759
corn so you may want to flush that soil

217
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,318
so if you're not going to test one easy

218
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,240
way to reuse your media whether it's

219
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,800
organic or synthetic is just to run a

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,240
fair bit of water through it or if it's

221
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
outside it's gonna it's probably gonna

222
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,299
rain depending on where you are in the

223
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,458
country and so a lot of that is going to

224
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,079
Leach out anyway

225
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,478
there are some environmental concerns

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,459
about leaching phosphates and nitrates

227
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,839
and things into our water supply so

228
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,299
that's something to definitely be

229
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,920
cognizant of but if we're strictly

230
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,958
talking about reusing that soil you

231
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
absolutely can okay that's good to know

232
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,399
yeah I actually asked the same question

233
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,500
to Jeff lowenfeld's shout out to him he

234
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,639
uh excellent guest on podcast I think

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,980
you might have had him on your podcast

236
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,778
in the past as well but uh asked him

237
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,399
about reusing soil where synthetic

238
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,500
nutrients were used he's like added to

239
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,958
your compost pile let the microbes work

240
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,278
it down and eventually work it back into

241
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,719
your garden so that's another

242
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,100
alternative but I like what you had

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,778
mentioned that if somebody's looking to

244
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,759
use that soil back to back they don't

245
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:20,159
have time to put into a compost pile for

246
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,080
example just flushing the medium yeah

247
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,579
just just a good friend of mine uh and

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,320
he's he's a character too he's great to

249
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,660
have on podcasters you can never hear

250
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,879
him speak live he's he's phenomenal um

251
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,019
what one thing I want to add to that is

252
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,338
when we're talking about chemical

253
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,039
nutrients it's important to understand

254
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,920
the the pathway to plants when we are

255
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,980
adding organic fertilizers versus

256
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,240
synthetic fertilizer so if you're adding

257
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,420
chemical fertilizers you're essentially

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,539
skipping that micro pathway when you you

259
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,819
they don't need to break that down so

260
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,259
you could add it to a compost pile I'm

261
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,480
going to disagree with Jeff slightly on

262
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,559
that in the sense that the microbes

263
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,639
don't really need to break it down

264
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,919
because it's already in a plant

265
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,120
available form so unless it's leached

266
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,919
through the soil those plants are going

267
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,459
to be able to access it

268
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,500
um

269
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,239
when we apply something like alfalfa

270
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
meal or fish meal or some sort of

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,019
organic fertilizer for the most part it

272
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,778
needs to go through that microbial

273
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:16,620
interaction What's called the microbial

274
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:19,019
Loop where the alfalfa meal gets broken

275
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,139
down by the microorganisms the bacteria

276
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,360
archaea fungi protozoa and then through

277
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,059
that prey and predation cycle it gets

278
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
converted into an ionic form which your

279
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,739
chemical fertilizer is already in so

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,139
it's just something to keep in mind that

281
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,820
makes sense now for the folks that are

282
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,100
using soil and they are growing

283
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,959
organically right they only have organic

284
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,180
inputs were added to the soil on that

285
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,819
previous growth cycle and they want to

286
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,979
reuse that soil for their next growth

287
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,860
cycle how would you go about reusing

288
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,300
that soil yeah so this is a little bit

289
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,759
tricky because

290
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,919
I realize a lot of a lot of Growers

291
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,899
can't afford to get their soil tested

292
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,778
it's just not practical to test it every

293
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,519
cycle if we want to make the best

294
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,980
data-driven decision then we have to use

295
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,539
the soil test and those are going to run

296
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,759
you about 50 bucks through a company

297
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,838
like Bryant and I really like Logan Labs

298
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,458
just because those are that's where we

299
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,279
started but whatever lab you go with

300
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,199
stick with it here in Washington state

301
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,820
if you live in King County you can use

302
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,720
the extension service to get a really

303
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,459
basic soil test back so that's an option

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,620
and that's free I think you get five

305
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,299
free lifetime tests so you may want to

306
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,159
check with your local plant extension

307
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,799
universities to see what kind of options

308
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,600
there are there for testing but if

309
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,939
testing is off the table then what I

310
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,220
like to do is I like to look at the

311
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,320
plant and see what sorts of things

312
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,660
um am I able to tell from my last cycle

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,278
so did the plant have any deficiencies

314
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,740
that have any toxicities that were

315
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,439
visually available for me to see if not

316
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,240
then I'm going to amend uh you know kind

317
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,760
of conservatively realizing that every

318
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,560
every time I harvest a plant whether

319
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,838
that's a tomato a lettuce plant a

320
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,799
medicinal plant I'm pulling out

321
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,180
nutrients from that soil I'm pulling out

322
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,819
organic matter I'm pulling out biomass

323
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,379
so all of those things in theory need to

324
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,560
be replaced because this isn't a closed

325
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,600
loop so I'm going to probably add back

326
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,018
in maybe a little bit of compost I'm

327
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,399
going to add in some more nitrogen and a

328
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,700
little bit more phosphorus things that

329
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,980
may have been leached out or consumed

330
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,860
more rapidly potassium is another one

331
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,659
that is fairly mobile so we want to make

332
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,600
sure to put those back in in low levels

333
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,759
to at least maintain sufficiency in that

334
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,620
soil okay so pretty straightforward

335
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,139
there now there are a lot of people that

336
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,659
are actually grabbing the native soil in

337
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,100
their backyard and doing things to it do

338
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,778
you recommend that like adding in

339
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,720
fertilizer for example some sort of

340
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,519
aeration inoculating with microbes do

341
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,259
you recommend folks do that instead of

342
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,700
going out and buying a bagged potting

343
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,919
soil from their local nursery for

344
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,920
example yeah I mean I think it depends

345
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,439
like I mean just like native soils

346
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,500
compost potting soils all those can vary

347
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,860
quite a bit in quality and

348
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,740
um like I just moved to Fox Island here

349
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,620
in Washington state and we are within

350
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,519
like 10 10 or 15 miles of an area that

351
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:17,399
had an old smelter and so the amount of

352
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:21,179
heavy metals in our soils is really high

353
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,039
if I lived in a city for example where I

354
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,319
knew there's been a lot of disturbance

355
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,000
there's been a lot of you know

356
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,620
leaching and things that may have come

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,240
into contact like if let's say I'm

358
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,639
trying to grow in like a sideway patch

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,519
or something like our sidewalk area or

360
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,959
somewhere that was close to a road

361
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,419
I would be a little more cautious to

362
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,479
bring that indoors now if I had if I

363
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,399
lived on acreage in the woods and I you

364
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,700
know that soil was of good quality then

365
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,919
we could talk about how to how to amend

366
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,200
that or use that in for growing plants

367
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,620
but like here I would I won't use my

368
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,440
native soil for growing any anything I

369
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,078
plan on consuming any edible crops just

370
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,360
because of the fact that I know our soil

371
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,799
is quite high in heavy metals here in in

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
the area that I'm in and I just don't

373
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,399
think it's safer

374
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,379
for my family and we're going to get

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,600
into heavy metals here in a little bit

376
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,700
that's a topic that isn't talked about

377
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,560
enough in my opinion so I can't wait to

378
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,300
dive into that in a little bit okay so

379
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,039
let's say that folks aren't able to use

380
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,259
the naval native soil in their backyard

381
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:25,019
either they can't do it or they simply

382
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,379
prefer using a bagged potting mix what

383
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,700
brands do you recommend yeah uh Lino let

384
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,220
me back up real quick before I answer

385
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,700
that too so when we're talking about

386
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,560
evaluating soils or potting soil which

387
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,360
is actually technically soilless media

388
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,219
even what we're calling living soil

389
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
today is really a soilless media because

390
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,759
it doesn't contain actual sand silt and

391
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,519
clay

392
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,338
what I look for is sort of this

393
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,039
uh picture picture like a triangle or a

394
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,019
tripod and the the three things that I'm

395
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,198
looking at is one that the physical

396
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,240
properties of that soil how well does it

397
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,000
drain what how well does it retain

398
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,139
nutrients what kind of porosity does it

399
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,539
have

400
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,698
um what about how compacted is it what

401
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:11,939
ability does the do the roots have to

402
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,559
penetrate deeper into that soil so so

403
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,420
you have the physical properties of that

404
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,599
soil that's really important for healthy

405
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:21,000
plants gas exchange water hydrology all

406
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,100
of that sort of thing the next aspect is

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,778
the biological aspect of this now you

408
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,820
can kind of cut that out if we're going

409
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,799
straight to synthetic nutrients but if

410
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,060
we're using an organic system it's that

411
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,620
biology that's obviously really

412
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,179
important for cycling nutrients and

413
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,639
making them into a plant available form

414
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:39,000
and then the last aspect of the

415
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,000
fertility is the actual minerals in that

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,100
soil you know the amount of nitrogen

417
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,799
phosphorus potassium sulfur calcium all

418
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,879
of our major essential plant nutrients

419
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,039
so

420
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,639
that's sort of where I start in my head

421
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,819
when I'm thinking about ahai using a

422
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,759
soil or using a potting soil whatever

423
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,680
the media is is is really you know how

424
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,419
do I address or adjust those three

425
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,419
things to make sure they're optimal for

426
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,379
whatever plant I'm growing so then when

427
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,219
we get into brands of potting soil

428
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:13,019
that's a little bit of a tricky question

429
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,000
because I'm you know I formulate in

430
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,759
manufacture potting soil for a living so

431
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,379
obviously I'm biased I do think if

432
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,338
you're paying money for soil you should

433
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,419
absolutely ask for a soil test and uh at

434
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,940
the very least they should be able to

435
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:29,399
explain to you a little bit more about

436
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,420
why they formulated the soil the way

437
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,458
they did

438
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,559
like if you were to call my company I'd

439
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,599
be able to tell you uh everything about

440
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,219
our soil why we add what we do what it's

441
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,659
good for growing what it's not good for

442
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,759
growing you know like I wouldn't grow

443
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:44,039
blueberries in in most of our soils

444
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,839
without adding sulfur to adjust the pH

445
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,458
because it it's too high and that

446
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,220
plant's not going to be it's not going

447
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,539
to grow got it and so actually I want to

448
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,480
get a little bit deeper into your soil

449
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:56,338
because your kiss Organics soil it's uh

450
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,379
technically it's a super soil right to

451
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,240
where you can just plant in it and then

452
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,399
it should last the entire growth cycle

453
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,318
without any additional inputs to be

454
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,699
added in there is that right and if so

455
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,459
can you actually just talk to us a

456
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,919
little bit about that soil yeah so super

457
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,480
soil was actually a term that was uh I

458
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,819
believe trademarked by Scott's Miracle

459
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,279
Grow way back in the 70s so I had to

460
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,959
change my label uh but that was sort of

461
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,759
the common term back in the day when

462
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,140
people were growing in TGA soil

463
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,338
if you've been around the industry for a

464
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,679
little while that's sort of where it all

465
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:31,200
started uh and we were one of the first

466
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,960
ones making these you know super soils

467
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,779
now people call them living soils that's

468
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,538
the latest term that's really popular or

469
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,579
water only soils and the idea is is that

470
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,079
we pack as much fertility balance

471
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:44,939
fertility into the soil at the beginning

472
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,699
of the cycle so really you're not having

473
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,500
to add nutrients or fertilizer you can

474
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,980
just water your plants and get a good

475
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,079
healthy Organic Harvest

476
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,079
unfortunately that too is complicated

477
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,519
because if you try to grow in a three

478
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,720
gallon pot you're going to get very

479
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,879
different results than if you were

480
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,579
growing in a 30 gallon pot or in a bed

481
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,039
and I'm sure you know you're familiar

482
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:10,678
with this too that plant is going to

483
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,319
grow it's going to use up the fertility

484
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,940
in a small pot quite quickly so this

485
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,519
idea this claim of being able to go the

486
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,340
full cycle without any other nutrients

487
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,019
is really dependent on the amount of

488
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:24,720
nutrients and how long that plant is

489
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,759
going to be in the pot so

490
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,640
you know for for medicinal plants a

491
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,700
tomato uh a seven gallon pot is sort of

492
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,919
the the minimum size I like to see but

493
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,500
we have a lot of guys growing in raised

494
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,538
beds and we've actually done some some

495
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,000
scientific trials at facilities and

496
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:45,140
discovered that plants grown communally

497
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,720
in beds outperform plants grown

498
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,880
individually in pots so even if that

499
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,819
soil so for example if I took a plant

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,039
and put it in a pot by itself an

501
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:59,220
isolated container and gave it more soil

502
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:02,099
by volume let's say 30 gallons and then

503
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,980
I took a bed a yard of soil and put

504
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,538
12 plants in there the amount of soil

505
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,700
per plant is going to be lower in the

506
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,579
bed but that plant in the bed is going

507
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,900
to out yield the one in the pot and we

508
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,038
actually have researched to back that I

509
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,140
think it's available on our website

510
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,099
people can look at that study that we

511
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,538
did

512
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,439
and so

513
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:22,798
um

514
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,380
yes the idea being that if you if you

515
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,359
plant the plant

516
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,340
in our soil or in a living soil that's

517
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,379
well balanced you can go the whole cycle

518
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,459
just water at the end of the cycle

519
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,980
you're going to harvest your plant

520
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,100
you'll take out the above ground biomass

521
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,620
so the stock the leaves and and take

522
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,298
that away utilize it and then what we do

523
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:44,399
whatever root matter comes with it is

524
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:45,839
great but we don't worry about excess

525
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,538
root hairs and things like that in the

526
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,759
soil and then we've typically done a

527
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:53,279
soil test if you were like a commercial

528
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,558
grower at a facility and we would

529
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,079
reamend that soil based off of that soil

530
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,240
test that we took two weeks earlier with

531
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,000
exactly what that bed needs to get it

532
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,558
ready for the next cycle and then 24 to

533
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,740
36 hours we're bringing in our next

534
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,418
flowering crop and running that for

535
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,740
another cycle and so we're reusing the

536
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,780
media and we have some guys who have

537
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,380
been doing this for you know upwards of

538
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:18,779
five to eight years in the same soil

539
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,000
they've never had to replace the media

540
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:22,740
so uh we know it works and they're

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,079
they're growing some of the best uh

542
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,640
product here in Washington and some of

543
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,678
the other states that we've been we've

544
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,780
been working in that's awesome yeah I've

545
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,820
been reusing my soil for probably like

546
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:37,440
two to three years now and uh yeah I I

547
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,240
was one of the ones that believe that

548
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,460
you can't reuse soil if you're using

549
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,460
synthetics in there and uh luckily I

550
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,779
learned that you can and uh I switched

551
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,460
over to Organics as well and that's

552
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,079
that's what I've been reusing the soil

553
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,660
with Organic inputs it's been working

554
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,599
out great there's really no need to go

555
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,700
to the nursery every single gross cycle

556
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,740
and spend hundreds of dollars on on bag

557
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,779
soil I've been using build to soil craft

558
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,859
blend it's kind of like a one-parter

559
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,319
that you can use throughout the whole

560
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:06,000
growth cycle and I haven't been doing

561
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,319
follow-up soil tests I'm one of the you

562
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,619
know I'm just a small home grower

563
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,720
growing six to twelve plants Max so me

564
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,479
sending out soil tests every single grow

565
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,400
it's just I should yeah I should be

566
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,200
doing that and and really really bit

567
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,120
balancing and buying the individual

568
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,038
amendments and you know amending that

569
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,599
way but I've just been using that one

570
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,319
parter and it's been working out good

571
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,719
for me so oh good oh good yeah what we

572
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,460
find uh when we are able to soil test

573
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,159
because you know we do work with a lot

574
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,058
of larger facilities is that over time

575
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,980
we'll start to see things build up so if

576
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:44,460
if you're uh you know particular

577
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:48,058
cultivar is pulling more say magnesium

578
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,659
for example than another cultivar

579
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,819
um

580
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,100
or the amount of magnesium you're adding

581
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,960
over time you would have a magnesium

582
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,879
deficiency or the same thing goes the

583
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,798
other direction with nitrogen you know

584
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,679
and the potential for toxicity with too

585
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,720
much if the plants so it's all about how

586
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,340
much is the plant pulling out how much

587
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,519
is in the soil and how much are you

588
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:10,918
adding so it's really hard to get those

589
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,200
perfectly if you don't if you're just

590
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,419
trying to do it based off of

591
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,279
um you know essentially guessing but it

592
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,960
is you know the nice thing about all of

593
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,658
this process is that I probably need to

594
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,519
mention is

595
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:26,820
what we call living soil has a much

596
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,099
greater capacity to buffer things than

597
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,798
hydro and other methods so at the end of

598
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,899
the day even if you're way off

599
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,119
um the soil is probably going to help

600
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,940
with that and that's why people say like

601
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,219
pH doesn't matter you know or I you know

602
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,159
I don't need to test it in living soils

603
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,440
is because of that buffering capacity so

604
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,820
that's I think that's why you're having

605
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
the success that you are and that's

606
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,319
awesome like I love to hear that that's

607
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,820
great let's get deeper into pH that's uh

608
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,379
that's the next thing up here you

609
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,079
actually did an Instagram video on this

610
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,419
and you had some great information and a

611
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,879
lot of misconceptions particularly pH

612
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,159
doesn't matter in living soil or not

613
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,140
what's your take on that yeah it was

614
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,400
kind of uh it's honestly kind of

615
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,580
shocking to me that this was such a

616
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,220
controversial topic and I'll be honest I

617
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,779
started off on that sort of organic soil

618
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,940
route thinking it wasn't that important

619
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,700
because I never had to deal with it I

620
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,980
have really good water here in in the

621
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,480
Seattle area

622
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,740
that doesn't have a lot of mineral

623
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,500
content and is fairly neutral and then

624
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,480
my soils that I used were always within

625
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,500
a good PH range but

626
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,140
pH absolutely matters take 10 seconds

627
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,900
hop on Google and just Google PH

628
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,000
availability chart for plants and it

629
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,100
it's very obvious when you look at that

630
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,659
that there are certain ranges when

631
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,599
nutrients are going to be more available

632
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,640
for your plant and heavy metals are

633
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,980
going to be less available and so if we

634
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,038
can stay within that optimal PH range

635
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,558
and for me if we're growing medicinal

636
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,419
plants in living soil I like to run a

637
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,119
little more alkaline so I usually Target

638
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,580
around six eight

639
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,779
um I'll go as low as six five now if

640
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,178
you're in hydro and other things people

641
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,220
are down in the fives or low sixes and

642
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,080
for me I like to run a little bit more

643
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,298
alkaline because that reduces heavy

644
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,099
metal uptake um it doesn't necessarily

645
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,019
limit a lot of the nutrient availability

646
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,119
and we still get good yields and good

647
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,119
results but yes

648
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,519
pH absolutely matters anyone who's

649
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,038
taking a plant botany course and

650
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,019
understands how plants uptake nutrients

651
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,220
will under will

652
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,599
we'll agree with it's one of those

653
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,038
things that like soil scientists just

654
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,199
don't argue about it's like the Earth is

655
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,720
round yet when we get into the living

656
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,659
soil Community that's where things get a

657
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,100
little bit uh you know less sure on on

658
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,460
some of these just basic plant

659
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:53,339
physiology questions so if a grower is

660
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,460
growing with Organic inputs and they're

661
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:59,819
water source comes in at a high pH let's

662
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,220
say seven or even 7.5 or above

663
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,079
would you recommend that they use like

664
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,240
some form of pH Down whether it be

665
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,480
phosphoric acid or one of the organic

666
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,359
methods of lowering the pH to that water

667
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,099
prior to doing a soil drench or would

668
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,979
you just recommend them water it in

669
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:18,058
above 7.0 pH or whatever it is above

670
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,480
that

671
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:25,259
yeah so we and we see this I've seen

672
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,620
water tests that are crazy with heavy

673
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,679
metals with uh sodium with high levels

674
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,298
of calcium

675
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,580
we you need to know where your water is

676
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,819
so that you can adjust it to Optimal

677
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,918
levels again if you water if your soil

678
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:42,119
is you know let's just say it's at six

679
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,440
eight and then you're watering with

680
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,719
water that's seven five and it's

681
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,700
bringing in high levels of sodium over

682
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,278
time you're going to have and sodium is

683
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,798
not a plant essential nutrient over time

684
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,740
you're going to have some issues with

685
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,119
high soluble salts osmotic shock and

686
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,220
your plant's just not going to grow as

687
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,739
well is the plant going to be okay if

688
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,600
you water a few times with 7375 water

689
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,159
yeah absolutely you might make it a

690
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,319
cycle you might make it two cycles but

691
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,659
over time you're going to have issues if

692
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,339
you're not accounting for that and if

693
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,340
you were to take that same water and you

694
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,119
were to pH it down your plant is going

695
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,379
to have to work a lot less

696
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,418
it's not going to work as hard to access

697
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,100
those nutrients and if it's not having

698
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,278
to work as hard to access nutrients it's

699
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:28,019
putting more energy into creating

700
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,119
flowers creating you know creating

701
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,579
biomass all the things that you want a

702
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,918
healthy plant to do so we're just we're

703
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:37,259
just making it easier on the plant in a

704
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,580
lot of ways and and reducing the risk of

705
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,158
some of these other

706
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,480
of some of these other imbalances

707
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
understood now a lot of folks are gonna

708
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,740
say that you know when you're pH

709
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,179
adjusting it and you do a slow drench

710
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,220
you're killing off the microbes in there

711
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,740
because you're using phosphoric acid for

712
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,400
example our microbes being killed with

713
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,278
ph up and PH down Solutions you know

714
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,679
I hear this a lot from what I've seen

715
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,558
the research I've seen actually uh

716
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,900
phosphoric acid feeds microbes in low

717
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,519
levels which is what you should be using

718
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,019
if your water is that far off that

719
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,900
you're having to use excessively high

720
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,639
levels of PH down then you probably need

721
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,159
to be filtering your water using other

722
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,538
means

723
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,880
one thing I will say if you're using

724
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:21,960
phosphoric acid your P availability goes

725
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,778
through the roof which means you're

726
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,000
probably if you're leaching your soil as

727
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:30,599
in getting runoff you're probably adding

728
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,298
phosphates to our water supply which is

729
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,178
not a great thing we're already at Peak

730
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:38,038
phosphorus

731
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:40,380
phosphates in our water cause algal

732
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,720
blooms they cause huge issues with our

733
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,820
water supply so

734
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,919
I don't I don't recommend using high

735
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:48,839
levels of phosphoric acid if you need to

736
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,460
use a little bit to lower your pH you

737
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,139
want to account for that in terms of how

738
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,298
you're managing your your other

739
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,940
phosphorus sources you probably need to

740
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,980
reduce those quite a bit if you're using

741
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,558
a lot of phosphoric acid you can also

742
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,319
use sulfuric acid

743
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,200
to lower pH and you can also use citric

744
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,278
acid but they all have pros and cons

745
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,019
citric acid would be really your only

746
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,900
organic option but it's not a great

747
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,960
buffering tool so if you were to add

748
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,100
citric acid into a reservoir for example

749
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,778
and and put it in there and then come

750
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:21,359
back later in the day your pH probably

751
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:24,359
has gone back up again so it doesn't

752
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,879
have as much of an impact overall on

753
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:31,139
lowering pH so just something to keep in

754
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,900
mind oh and just this morning I saw some

755
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,840
more lab tests I've seen two lab tests

756
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:40,759
now on PH down products that were

757
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:44,939
causing people to fail in certain States

758
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,319
for heavy metals specifically arsenic in

759
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,400
this case so

760
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:53,038
uh if you are a commercial cultivator

761
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,080
check your pH down as another source of

762
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,658
heavy metal contamination and we're

763
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,859
talking like big time brands in the

764
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,900
industry

765
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:02,879
um these are not like they're using

766
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,380
small uncommon if I if I were to say the

767
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,299
brand you'd be like oh my gosh that's a

768
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,700
huge multi-million dollar company that's

769
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:11,759
been around forever kind of thing so

770
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,440
probably GH I'm not I'm not going to say

771
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,558
what the brand is but do your research

772
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,538
yeah all right all right fair enough

773
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,819
I want to get into organic fertilizer

774
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,859
Blends you know they've become more and

775
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,720
more popular over recent years due to

776
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,939
their ease of use what are some of the

777
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,700
pros and cons to using these organic

778
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,278
Blends yeah so if I'm

779
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,259
if I'm growing tomatoes Outdoors

780
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,298
uh and I want to go to the store and buy

781
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,158
a fertilizer that has a picture of a

782
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:40,200
tomato on it for example that that

783
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,899
really simplifies the process and the

784
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,278
nice thing about growing Outdoors is a

785
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:46,319
lot of those nutrients are going to

786
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,140
Leach out of the soil in between Cycles

787
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,000
so because of rain events things like

788
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,340
that so I'm pretty much starting from

789
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,079
scratch every year I'm not going to have

790
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,058
excess nitrates in there I'm not gonna

791
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,079
have a lot of available phosphates I'm

792
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:59,759
not going to have a really much

793
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,740
potassium

794
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,940
so I can as someone who formulates

795
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,740
fertilizers and nutrients I can feel

796
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,200
fairly confident what that starting

797
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,960
point is for most Growers from a from a

798
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,298
fertility from a chemistry perspective

799
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,819
so it makes it really easy now if you

800
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,960
want to dial that in a soil test is

801
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,398
really useful but if you're not going to

802
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,019
use a soil test and you're growing

803
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,719
veggies and you want to just add a

804
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:26,519
veggie fertilizer it's not a bad way to

805
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,380
go you are paying a premium for that

806
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,139
product because they've mixed it

807
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,240
together for you you're buying the brand

808
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,880
and some are going to be higher quality

809
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,319
sources than others but

810
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,600
um yeah there's certainly nothing wrong

811
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,339
with it now indoors where you're not

812
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,319
leeching your soil where you're not

813
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,538
getting that same level of runoff you

814
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:48,000
can get that build up and and

815
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,119
toxicities or sufficiency challenges

816
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,460
over time okay and are there any Blends

817
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,639
that you recommend to use or recommend

818
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,220
not to use when growing medicinal plants

819
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,200
oh yeah it's so tough just because as

820
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,460
someone who's in that industry

821
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,159
um I don't really want to step on

822
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,019
anyone's toes uh

823
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,820
here's what I'll say

824
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,220
if you were buying

825
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,740
uh bottled nutrients

826
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,500
a lot of what you're paying for is water

827
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,359
so there are better options out there so

828
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,579
a couple companies if you're using

829
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,379
chemical nutrients that I personally

830
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:27,058
turn people to is is Beanstalk

831
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,340
agriculture which is a lot like

832
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:31,259
um it's like osmocode but it's designed

833
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:33,119
for medicinal plants if you've ever seen

834
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:34,980
those little tiny Pebbles that come in

835
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,898
your nursery plant at Home Depot they're

836
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,759
just slow release fertilizers they're

837
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,199
chemical fertilizers and they're going

838
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,079
to release nutrients slowly over time

839
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Beanstalk makes a product like that that

840
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,019
you can just put in your soil water your

841
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,700
plant it's going to release the

842
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,259
nutrients slowly and it's optimized for

843
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,120
medicinal plants

844
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:54,058
if you're someone who likes to mix your

845
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,798
nutrients you're a chemical grower and

846
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,558
you want to do this as affordably as

847
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,440
possible the best company that that I've

848
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,940
seen out there is Jax Dr Carrie Peters

849
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,759
is their chemist their family business

850
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,000
they're great people

851
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:11,099
they test regularly for heavy metals and

852
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,019
for nutrient quality I've had her on my

853
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:15,058
podcast once I'm actually going to

854
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,000
interview her again on Friday they've

855
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:20,460
done a ton of tissue testing and lab

856
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,798
analysis on the product a great company

857
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,620
if you're going to go chemical nutrients

858
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,720
on the organic side obviously I love I

859
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,398
love what we're doing at kiss we put a

860
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,798
lot of time and energy into creating a

861
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,479
soil and fertilizer you know it took me

862
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,398
it takes me about two years to formulate

863
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,380
a soil mix before I'll release it

864
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,558
because I really want to do that

865
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,559
research and know it's a good product

866
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,200
um one thing I will say especially for

867
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,940
people who are growing organically and

868
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,259
are worried about heavy metals or in a

869
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,659
state where they need to pass for heavy

870
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,940
metals these tests that I'm seeing on

871
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,260
social media do not match the test that

872
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,538
I'm seeing when we test things

873
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:59,339
independently

874
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:01,259
um so just because someone claims to be

875
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:03,119
transparent online does not mean that

876
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:07,019
their product quality or their product

877
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,398
is actually what they say it is so

878
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,960
um just be careful there and test your

879
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:10,979
products but I'm not going to name any

880
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,940
names

881
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,339
um

882
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,840
in that regard okay fair enough I know

883
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:18,418
there's some people that avoid the

884
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,879
Blends they'd rather go the individual

885
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,799
Amendment route what are some of your

886
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,360
favorite organic amendments to add to

887
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,879
the soil maybe talk to us about what the

888
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,519
amendment is application rate when to

889
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,100
add you know so on and so forth yeah oh

890
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,599
man that's uh that's a whole podcast in

891
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,278
and of itself because there's so many

892
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,918
amendments so

893
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,440
like if you go on our website on on

894
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,259
kissorganics.com you can you can click

895
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,659
on any Amendment let's just say fish

896
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,859
meal so fish meal is a good nitrogen

897
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,539
Source

898
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,019
um that's going to be fairly available

899
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:54,240
it's it's the the size of the molecule

900
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,179
or the size of the product whether it's

901
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,519
finely ground powder or it's um prilled

902
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,740
or a larger pellet it's going to

903
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,000
determine how available that plant that

904
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,500
product is so if you want something

905
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,579
that's going to break down

906
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:11,039
uh more breakdown slowly then you you

907
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,259
want something that has a larger surface

908
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,239
area sorry I said that backwards smaller

909
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,399
surface area the larger the surface area

910
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,739
is and the smaller the more the particle

911
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:22,019
size the more available it's going to be

912
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,819
um in term but but fish meal is a great

913
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,259
great nitrogen source so if you

914
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,760
specifically want to add nitrogen you

915
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,919
can use fish meal you can go on the

916
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,839
website and see the heavy metal test and

917
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,719
see the NPK level that tells you how

918
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,759
much nitrogen is in that product

919
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,739
um and so then at that point it really

920
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,240
comes down to when I'm looking at these

921
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,598
different amendments it comes down to

922
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,459
cost and it comes down to you know what

923
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,480
am I paying for that nitrogen because at

924
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,579
the end of the day the plant doesn't

925
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,980
care if it gets its nitrate from a

926
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:54,480
bottle of nutrient from alfalfa meal

927
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,820
from fish meal nitrate is nitrate now

928
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,179
some sources are better than others in

929
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,700
the sense of how available they are or

930
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:05,219
if they're bringing in other nutrients

931
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:06,838
or again I know I've said heavy metals a

932
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:08,819
few times on this podcast if they if

933
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,139
they're if they come with heavy metals

934
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,119
those are all things that you can factor

935
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:14,940
into your your purchase decision but

936
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,920
yeah I like to play around too I like to

937
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,940
add those individual things kind of like

938
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
a

939
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,480
you know kind of like a wizard or a

940
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,940
witch trying to like make a potion sort

941
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,679
of thing to maximize my

942
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,420
my plant Health

943
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,919
um but I like to do it around a soil

944
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,480
test so I actually know that what I'm

945
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,159
adding is what I what is needed because

946
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,380
I I do see that where people are like

947
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,559
okay there's this hype product right now

948
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,338
I see online everyone's using it and

949
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,179
um

950
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:43,799
if that product's main main product is

951
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,899
the main thing in it is let's just say

952
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
phosphorus for example and I've already

953
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,099
got phosphorus sufficiency if I add more

954
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,479
phosphorus that could be causing

955
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,980
problems you know what Brian talked

956
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,519
about now my iron may be less available

957
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,199
or other other nutrients so it's

958
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,519
important to keep that in mind when you

959
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,259
start playing around with all these

960
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,000
little individual amendments that

961
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,140
they're balanced that they're you know

962
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
helpful to the plants um

963
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:11,039
yeah I think if I were to if I were to

964
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,480
talk about one it would be calcium and

965
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,539
lime just we want to talk about

966
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
individual amendments really quick so

967
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,739
when it comes to calcium you have you

968
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,180
have a few different uh I mean there's a

969
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,618
lot of options like fishbone meal

970
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,000
anything with phosphorus is going to

971
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,920
bring in calcium more or less but if

972
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,940
we're talking about just limes there's a

973
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,200
lot of different limes out there and

974
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,358
they're kind of confusing so if we're

975
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,000
talking about agricultural lime or

976
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,920
oyster shell flour they're primarily

977
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,338
calcium carbonate they're going to raise

978
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,838
your pH and that's important to know too

979
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:41,639
so if you're low in calcium you have a

980
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,559
low PH this is when you want to use

981
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,838
agriculture lime or oyster shell flour

982
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,699
and you can use those too I mean the

983
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,619
amount of trace minerals in oyster shell

984
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,819
flower is so small people think they

985
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,440
want oyster shell because it's better

986
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,900
than egg lime they're the same thing

987
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,099
they're both mined products they're

988
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,260
close enough that you can use them

989
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,700
together

990
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,800
whatever's cheaper and then the other

991
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:03,598
one is Dolomite lime well Dolomite lime

992
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,460
is going to bring in it's calcium

993
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,920
carbonate and magnesium carbonate so

994
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,019
we're getting a fairly large load of

995
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,480
magnesium that you may or may not want

996
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:15,960
so I don't like to use Dolomite very

997
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,639
often it's not balanced properly for

998
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,380
plant health I mean if you were to

999
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:21,239
confuse yourself and add Dolomite it's

1000
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,140
going to raise your pH a lot faster and

1001
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:27,239
a lot and a lot higher than

1002
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:28,739
calcium carbonate or eggline and then

1003
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,358
the last one is gypsum so if you're not

1004
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,098
sure you have a good pH you think you

1005
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,440
need calcium stick with gypsum the

1006
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,180
sulfur and the gypsum keeps the keeps

1007
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
you it buffers the pH so essentially

1008
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:39,960
it's not gonna it's not going to really

1009
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,599
change the pH of your soil

1010
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,338
so that's just where knowing a little

1011
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,800
bit about limes can make a huge

1012
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:48,119
difference in what you add to your soil

1013
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,119
mix definitely some good information

1014
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,920
there now how about for potassium is

1015
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,480
there like an amendment that you would

1016
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,240
recommend I know a lot of people will

1017
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,219
add in some potassium in flowering for

1018
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,739
example in order to help with flour

1019
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,919
production What organic amendment is

1020
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,539
good for potassium yeah so you know as

1021
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,280
Bryant mentioned a lot of people get

1022
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:10,500
sufficient potassium from their compost

1023
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,060
not all composts are high in potassium

1024
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,358
but quite a few of them are so that's

1025
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:17,219
something definitely to be aware of

1026
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:20,279
I like to keep potassium sulfate on hand

1027
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:23,098
it's 50 potassium it's very available

1028
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,019
potassium and it's it's cheap you know

1029
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,300
it's a few bucks a pound sort of a price

1030
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:29,579
point so it allows you to get a lot of

1031
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,099
available potassium really quickly if

1032
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:35,760
you see you have a potassium deficiency

1033
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,440
or if your plants just are not

1034
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,200
um if you're just not getting that that

1035
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,400
denseness in the flower Bud that you

1036
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,078
want

1037
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,240
um mid to end of cycle whether you're

1038
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,339
used to seeing it's probably a potassium

1039
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,019
deficiency and so that's where you could

1040
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:50,400
start adding potassium to see if you get

1041
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,039
that plant response that you want so

1042
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,838
that's something to be aware of

1043
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,300
potassium sulfates uh you know not

1044
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,119
technically considered completely an

1045
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,440
organic product however it is approved

1046
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,320
for use in organic production if you

1047
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,119
have a potassium deficiency so

1048
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,920
um it's something I like to use for

1049
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,780
potassium

1050
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,519
yeah in fact I would say the the

1051
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,980
products I like to have on hand if I'm a

1052
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:18,539
if I'm a tinkerer and uh you know I I

1053
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,300
know I'm gonna be need to add individual

1054
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:23,880
nutrients I like to have potassium

1055
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,700
sulfate I like to have agricultural

1056
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,700
sulfur and I would say I'd like to have

1057
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:32,338
gypsum on hand so that oh and uh

1058
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:34,019
magnesium sulfate so Epsom salt

1059
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,480
because those are all things that I can

1060
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:39,420
use to get calcium magnesium and

1061
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,099
potassium really quickly in a very

1062
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,380
available Source at a very affordable

1063
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,180
price and then the egg sulfur is a great

1064
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,720
way to lower your pH in your soil over

1065
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,858
time using in small doses awesome yeah I

1066
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,539
feel like we're just scratching the

1067
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:53,279
surface here with these individual

1068
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,739
amendments and probably could do a whole

1069
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,240
episode on this in the future so I might

1070
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,098
have to invite you back sometime in the

1071
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,439
future to now we're in on that you know

1072
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,180
sure let's uh let's get into heavy

1073
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,220
metals we talked about that a few times

1074
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,078
here it would mentioned but I want to

1075
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:09,239
get deeper into them they can certainly

1076
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,760
be a concern what should we know about

1077
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,098
heavy metals how do we test for them and

1078
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,420
how do we avoid them yeah so heavy

1079
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,240
metals is sort of something that's

1080
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,460
become relatively important in the

1081
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,639
industry and relatively new something

1082
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,900
that we weren't really talking about

1083
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:28,019
people were sort of indiscriminately

1084
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,880
using organic amendments and then states

1085
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:30,838
started testing for heavy metals and we

1086
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,440
found that there's certain things are

1087
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,119
going to be higher in Arsenic cadmium

1088
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,338
lead you know some of those major ones

1089
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,700
that are concerns so

1090
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:44,159
first of all I want to say this so

1091
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:48,659
no one is testing our vegetables right

1092
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:51,539
now for heavy metals and that to me is

1093
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,578
is much more of an issue than what they

1094
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,300
are doing in testing in terms of our

1095
00:40:53,579 --> 00:41:00,300
industry on the medicinal side

1096
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:02,160
so the other day I was out buying I was

1097
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,619
at the grocery store buying tomatoes and

1098
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,299
I was thinking about I was like do I

1099
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,039
want to buy that hydroponically grown

1100
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,839
tomato in California that was grown

1101
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,639
using chemical nutrients but probably

1102
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,679
not a lot of pesticides in a hot house

1103
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,139
or do I want to buy that certified

1104
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,739
organic tomato that was grown in Mexico

1105
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:22,199
that probably has lacks or standards and

1106
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,519
no one's testing for heavy metals so

1107
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,858
while it may have been grown organically

1108
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,320
it may be higher in Arsenic or lead or

1109
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:31,139
or cadmium than I want

1110
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,660
um too so it got me thinking about what

1111
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,039
you know it's a complicated issue I

1112
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:37,559
guess is what I want to say around that

1113
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,039
but in terms of how we manage it in

1114
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:40,039
soils

1115
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:43,440
um I want to say first of all we're

1116
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,599
passing in every state we did just have

1117
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,980
a fail in Massachusetts and then I just

1118
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,480
heard back from the grower today that

1119
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,059
the pH Down was their biggest

1120
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,740
contributor of heavy metals but every

1121
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:54,838
organic soil is going to have some level

1122
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:56,159
of heavy metals every organic fertilizer

1123
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:57,838
is going to have some level of heavy

1124
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,559
metals and so it all becomes down to

1125
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,239
management if we know how much the plant

1126
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,940
is taking out and a lot of medicinal

1127
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,559
plants are hyper accumulators of these

1128
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,000
heavy metals they're really really good

1129
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:14,400
like hemp is used in remediating a lot

1130
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,858
of damaged soils because it's so great

1131
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,780
at pulling out

1132
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:21,358
pulling out heavy metals and other and

1133
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,579
other toxins out of the soil so

1134
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,980
uh there's a few things we can do we can

1135
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,160
pull it we can pull heavy metals out by

1136
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,240
planting a crop that's going to

1137
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,440
essentially accumulate these nutrients

1138
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,479
and then

1139
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,940
getting rid of that that biomass all

1140
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,820
that leaf matter everything like that

1141
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,619
um also your stems and your leaves are

1142
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,160
going to have higher levels of heavy

1143
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:45,240
metals than your your bud or flour so

1144
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,920
that's something to keep in mind in

1145
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,719
terms of how you trim your plant for

1146
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,980
testing

1147
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,539
um

1148
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,579
let's see what are some other things to

1149
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:55,739
think about here so running a higher pH

1150
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,200
is going to help with certain heavy

1151
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,939
metals in them being less available to

1152
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:02,460
plants than others so that that will

1153
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,119
work too but really

1154
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,059
um

1155
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,440
you need your the amount that the

1156
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:10,739
plant's taking out of the out of the

1157
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,280
soil needs to be less than the

1158
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,779
regulatory standard but higher than what

1159
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,980
you're adding to the soil every cycle

1160
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,119
and I know that's a little hard to

1161
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,338
visualize

1162
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,900
um but but you just have to think about

1163
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:23,639
your inputs have to be bringing in less

1164
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,800
heavy metals than the plant is taking

1165
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:28,199
out and as long as you maintain that

1166
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,818
you'll continue to pass but we're

1167
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:32,338
talking about parts per million or in

1168
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:34,318
some cases parts per billion so it is it

1169
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:37,619
is something you have to be aware of and

1170
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,659
there's no formula to say okay if this

1171
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:43,380
soil has

1172
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:46,078
10 PPM of arsenic then my plant's gonna

1173
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,260
fail for heavy metals because

1174
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,359
how you water if you're using CO2 what

1175
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,760
your light levels are you know what your

1176
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,318
VPD is are all going to be factors in

1177
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,300
terms of how much heavy metals that

1178
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:00,420
plant takes up in addition to pH and

1179
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,760
other things so unfortunately there's no

1180
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,680
exact sign to this there's no great way

1181
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,540
to know but we can reduce heavy metals

1182
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,139
by utilizing products that are lower in

1183
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,139
heavy metals

1184
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,500
and working with you know who makes

1185
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,240
their fertilizer to know that what your

1186
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,500
product is is going to be safe and like

1187
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,759
I said there's some there's some

1188
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,719
products out there right now that I see

1189
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,280
on the market that are very very popular

1190
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,019
that are higher in heavy metals Than

1191
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,480
People realize based on the independent

1192
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,818
testing we've done and

1193
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,440
one one good option for people if they

1194
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:34,380
want to test themselves there's a lab

1195
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,139
called the Delta Urban soils lab uh I

1196
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,880
think they charge like 15 a sample it's

1197
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:40,500
not going to be as accurate as some of

1198
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,780
these other methodologies for testing

1199
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,000
heavy metals but it's an affordable way

1200
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,280
to get a test of your garden

1201
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,219
um without breaking the bank and they

1202
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,440
can also test fertilizers too so I've

1203
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:54,179
we've been using them just because of

1204
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,099
the price point you know if I I just

1205
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:58,139
sent in a sample to get certified for a

1206
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:00,539
new uh Bloom fertilizer that we're going

1207
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:02,699
to be releasing and I think it was like

1208
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,440
250 dollars to get the heavy metal

1209
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:06,179
analysis on it to get a certified

1210
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,780
analysis that I can then send to the

1211
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:12,358
state to register my product properly so

1212
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,819
yeah it can be expensive too is heavy

1213
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,559
metals more of a concern with some

1214
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,838
organic amendments than others for

1215
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,219
example garage phosphate is they're more

1216
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:22,559
likely to have heavy metals in there

1217
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:25,139
versus like an alfalfa meal or a kelp

1218
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,019
meal and so on and so forth

1219
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:30,779
yes though there's no there's no hard

1220
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,900
and fast rule so in general

1221
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,660
Rock phosphates So Soft Rock phosphate

1222
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,980
people have heard of calphos Eden makes

1223
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:40,318
a rock phosphate there's a bunch of them

1224
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,420
they're all mined products anything mind

1225
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,099
has the potential to have heavy metals

1226
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,260
in it and

1227
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,240
um so yes I think in general really

1228
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,099
watch Rock phosphates kelp meal is

1229
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,559
another one that we see a fair bit of

1230
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,880
variability on and you mentioned alfalfa

1231
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,179
meal and that's a great example here

1232
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,740
because people think that like all off

1233
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,598
Alpha meals are going to be the same but

1234
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,699
really it's is the soil that that

1235
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,160
alfalfa meal was grown in high in heavy

1236
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,239
metals if it was then that alfalfa meal

1237
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:08,399
is going to be higher in heavy metals

1238
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,439
but without testing of that particular

1239
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,720
Source you're not really going to know

1240
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,159
and and again alfalfa meal is a tough

1241
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,779
one because it may be sourced from a

1242
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,000
variety of different places under the

1243
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,800
same brand name every year so that's

1244
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,539
where testing kind of becomes more

1245
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,760
important so it sounds like whatever

1246
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,579
Source you're going to to buy that

1247
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,640
Alfalfa male or whatever looking for

1248
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:31,619
them doing that testing looking at that

1249
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:33,118
report and seeing if there has medals on

1250
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,619
there but also it sounds like doing your

1251
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,838
own individual testing because sometimes

1252
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,000
those tests aren't going to be accurate

1253
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:42,000
to what the testing that you do on your

1254
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,800
own so wow that's uh kind of crazy to

1255
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,139
hear yeah it's a challenge it's just

1256
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,240
something that unfortunately is is more

1257
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,699
complicated than we want it to be and

1258
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,439
it's the same too with uh nutrient

1259
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:54,719
levels so

1260
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,940
when I go online and I see these charts

1261
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,098
and forums of like NPK levels for

1262
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,880
various manures you know chicken manure

1263
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:04,740
cow manure for various amendments like

1264
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,740
fish meal or

1265
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,818
you know anything that has NPK those

1266
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:10,559
things are just going to be rough

1267
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:13,318
guidelines every product is going to be

1268
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,299
different and when the state has done

1269
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:16,259
testing on even the products like you go

1270
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,140
by

1271
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:22,079
tomato fertilizer and it's let's just

1272
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:25,199
say 555. when they go to test that it

1273
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,380
might end up being five seven three for

1274
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:31,679
example so there's there's inconsistency

1275
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:35,420
across product too and it's very hard to

1276
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:39,118
to to know without again without testing

1277
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,740
what you're actually getting got it that

1278
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,960
makes sense let's flip it up let's get

1279
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,818
into microbial inoculants I want to talk

1280
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,960
about that a little bit here you've got

1281
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:51,000
your soil added in fertilizer but you

1282
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,199
need those microbes in there in order to

1283
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,519
break down those amendments and turn

1284
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,139
them into usable nutrients for the

1285
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,358
plants right yeah now some people are

1286
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,500
doing the IMO process they are going

1287
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,500
into their backyard and getting

1288
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,539
microorganisms that way other people are

1289
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,159
buying products on the market what

1290
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:06,900
microbial inoculants do you recommend

1291
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,239
and how often should people be

1292
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,440
inoculating their medium yeah there's a

1293
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:11,879
lot of options out there on the market

1294
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,760
now and it's just it's getting more and

1295
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,619
more uh more and more crowded with

1296
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,780
microbial products and and some of of

1297
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:20,519
them are really really interesting I

1298
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,859
think there's some great microbial

1299
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,659
inoculants out there

1300
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,639
we've been using Mammoth P for a while

1301
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:28,139
there's another one called microbial

1302
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,059
mass that I'm setting up trials with

1303
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:32,159
right now that I know the founder of

1304
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:35,699
that I'm excited to see how that product

1305
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,500
performs and then uh I was just talking

1306
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:40,318
yesterday with a guy who's got a

1307
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,760
microbial organic cloning gel that I'm

1308
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,259
excited to start playing around with

1309
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,060
that they did in conjunction with the

1310
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,599
university to create research on so

1311
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:50,219
there are some good products out there

1312
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,960
a lot of the microbes out there are

1313
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,709
coming out of China and they're just

1314
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,300
being rebottled and Blended

1315
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,440
[Music]

1316
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,220
um

1317
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,059
and that can be good or bad

1318
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,338
um

1319
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:04,019
but you may but but the consistency

1320
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:05,818
across microbial products is something

1321
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:07,259
that's not standardized either and if

1322
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,440
you go on the Oregon Department of AG

1323
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,880
website you can see that

1324
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,920
um they did some testing and found that

1325
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,680
the claims on the labels don't match

1326
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,838
what's actually in the product too but

1327
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:21,358
things to consider looking into or

1328
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:23,400
researching uh trichoderma is is an

1329
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,920
interesting one there's a lot of good

1330
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,760
bacillus products out there

1331
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,460
um

1332
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,319
yeah I think what I would say whether

1333
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,559
you're doing an IMO whether you're doing

1334
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:38,179
uh you know you're buying a product is

1335
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,679
is do a control in your in your grow so

1336
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:42,659
maybe you do half your plants or a

1337
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:44,578
quarter of your plants and then test it

1338
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:46,019
and see keep all your other variables

1339
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:48,180
the same and see if you get the plant

1340
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:49,380
response that you want if you don't then

1341
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:51,000
maybe you don't need to be buying that

1342
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,180
product or maybe your application rate

1343
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,380
is wrong on it but um that's where I

1344
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:56,519
think people get in trouble is they

1345
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,079
start adding all these different

1346
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,000
products in or maybe they got a bunch of

1347
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,460
samples at a trade show and then you

1348
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,519
really have no idea if any of these

1349
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,960
things are beneficial if one of them may

1350
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,519
actually be antagonistic and you're

1351
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,119
spending money on something that you

1352
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,940
don't want or don't need necessarily

1353
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,858
um if you are doing IMO keep in mind

1354
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,900
that you do have the potential to be

1355
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:21,299
bringing in pathogens into your grow

1356
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,220
space so be aware of that risk same with

1357
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,640
same with compost tea same with anything

1358
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,299
you're sourcing outside or from compost

1359
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,358
um

1360
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,818
but the risk is relatively low and and

1361
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:34,440
it's something that can be managed so

1362
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:36,539
yeah just just try it on a few plants

1363
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,818
and see how it goes I mentioned several

1364
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:41,338
products throughout this episode and

1365
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:44,219
some of the products you got to be weary

1366
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:46,078
about right because some don't work as

1367
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:47,759
intended right there's marketing there

1368
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,039
and they sell you on it how do you

1369
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,520
evaluate a product for your garden cut

1370
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,318
through the marketing yeah that's uh I

1371
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,338
actually do whole talks on this

1372
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:59,338
um

1373
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:01,799
it's that's an interesting question so

1374
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:05,159
the first thing I try and do with any

1375
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,839
product is I I try and cut through the

1376
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:08,098
BS and look at it and say okay what are

1377
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:09,599
they actually telling me in terms of

1378
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,519
information if they start throwing away

1379
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,280
around words like proprietary or

1380
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,679
confidential usually that means they're

1381
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,599
hiding something that the product

1382
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,338
probably is something pretty basic it's

1383
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,500
it's not something necessarily all that

1384
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:25,139
novel or Innovative

1385
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,119
um the second thing I look at is what's

1386
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:28,980
actually in the product so what what is

1387
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,740
on the ingredient list that I that I can

1388
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,980
actually see because if they are

1389
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:38,039
guaranteeing uh an NPK level for example

1390
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,260
anything that provides NPK has to be

1391
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:42,239
listed in on the ingredient list and if

1392
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,640
the the company is not registering their

1393
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,379
products with States like as a

1394
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,480
fertilizer what they're doing is illegal

1395
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,400
and there's no oversight and you know

1396
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,679
buyer beware

1397
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,880
so uh that's one thing to consider and

1398
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:55,318
so I can look through that ingredient

1399
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,539
list and say okay well these are all

1400
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,400
things I can Source myself or these are

1401
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,659
these there's something unique here in

1402
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,338
terms of the way it's it's put together

1403
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,199
that I really want to experiment in my

1404
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:05,699
garden and then I'll try it out and see

1405
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,598
if I get the plant response that I

1406
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:07,679
wanted

1407
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,039
um so that's something you can look at

1408
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:13,318
too but a lot of these products that I'm

1409
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,318
finding on the market are

1410
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:17,818
are really just basic things that are

1411
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,558
overpriced like there's a lot of

1412
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,980
molasses based products on the market

1413
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,599
right now that are called sweet or Bud

1414
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,579
enhancer or things and you look at the

1415
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,559
ingredient list and you're like okay

1416
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,818
really they're just adding some molasses

1417
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,099
and maybe a little bit of potassium

1418
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:33,838
sulfate in there and I'm paying

1419
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:35,940
two to three hundred times what I need

1420
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,519
to for that product so

1421
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,619
yeah and just as a general rule if

1422
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,480
there's a picture of like a sexy woman

1423
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:44,460
on the cover of your bottled nutrient

1424
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,659
you're probably overpaying I just want

1425
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,159
to throw that out there because there

1426
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:49,139
are a few companies like that out there

1427
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:50,159
that have been around the industry for a

1428
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:50,759
while

1429
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:52,739
um

1430
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,359
so yeah I mean at the end of the day you

1431
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,219
just gotta you gotta try things out in a

1432
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:58,380
controlled setting and then determine if

1433
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:59,939
that product is worth spending money on

1434
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,099
the one thing I want to add on that is

1435
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,019
like uh so one of the examples I use in

1436
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:06,300
my PowerPoint is seaweed extract powder

1437
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:09,780
so you can buy seaweed extract powder

1438
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:13,260
it's going to be like zero zero 16 for

1439
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,819
example or you can buy liquid seaweed

1440
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,440
liquid seaweed is typically

1441
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:18,119
reconstituted from seaweed extract

1442
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,880
powder only you're paying now for them

1443
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,260
to do that for you or you can add you

1444
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,140
know a quarter to half a teaspoon per

1445
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,440
gallon of the extract powder yourself

1446
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:31,440
and this save you know hundreds of

1447
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,420
dollars on on a product so that's that's

1448
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,760
a good example there where you can you

1449
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,920
know egg seal 16h is another one

1450
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,300
potassium silicate you can buy all these

1451
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,119
different silica products or you can

1452
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,640
just buy Potassium silicate in the form

1453
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,140
of egg cell add it to water yourself and

1454
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,900
save a ton of money so these are there

1455
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,920
are some ways to like get around

1456
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,240
spending a lot of money on products

1457
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,159
there's another thing I feel like we're

1458
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,679
just scratching the surface on and we

1459
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,239
could probably go way deeper on if we

1460
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,159
really wanted to but we are coming up

1461
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,838
towards the end of the episode here a

1462
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:02,039
couple more things I want to ask you uh

1463
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:03,480
number one is there anything else in

1464
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:05,099
regards to reasoning soil that you think

1465
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,139
is beneficial for the audience to know

1466
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,660
yeah if you're if you're unsure about

1467
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:12,900
the quality of your soil uh pile it up

1468
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:15,539
outside leave it for a few months let it

1469
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,220
get rained on and then bring it back in

1470
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,719
and reamend it like or don't bring it

1471
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,759
back in sorry use it in your garden

1472
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,519
outside because it may have picked up

1473
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,680
some pests or pathogens um pretty much

1474
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,719
as if it was just a brand new soil that

1475
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,919
didn't have any fertility that's

1476
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:29,959
probably the simplest and easiest

1477
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,139
solution

1478
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,480
at the end of the day all all media for

1479
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:38,338
the most part can be reused in worst

1480
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,079
cases you have to Leach it but

1481
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:41,818
yeah that's my don't throw out your soil

1482
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,880
that's probably my my biggest piece of

1483
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:46,920
advice got it all right well let's wrap
