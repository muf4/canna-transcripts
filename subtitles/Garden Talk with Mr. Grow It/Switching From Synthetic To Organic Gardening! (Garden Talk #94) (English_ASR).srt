1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
coming up on Garden talk the main

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,440
difference is control and organic

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,019
growing I think the control lies within

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,960
the plant where synthetic growing the

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,460
control lies within the grower I loved

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,379
it I thought it was the greatest thing I

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,660
was like plastic Plastics thing in the

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,220
past throw the plastic away this is what

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,439
it's about well I'll switch over to

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,839
organic and it's like wait dude get the

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,698
plastic back out of the trash five to

12
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,820
ten percent for watering organic living

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,740
soil whether it be everyday or every two

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,600
to three days that's what you want to

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,299
water so if I'm going in a one gallon

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,760
POD at a time I'm watering probably 400

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,759
milliliters if it's a big vigorous plant

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,500
those plants were as tall as me and

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,199
probably as wide as my tent right here

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
man they were healthy they were huge and

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,520
they were healthy and they were green

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,619
and all they got was six gallons of

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,620
terrible tap water every single day

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,238

both indoors as well as outdoors and

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,900
recently made the switch from growing

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,820
with salt-based fertilizers often

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,618
referred to as synthetic to using

34
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,658
organic inputs and that's what we're

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,340
going to get into in today's episode he

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,439
talks all about how he used to grow at

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,079
synthetic nutrients and how he now does

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,000

great today we're going to talk all

92
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,079
about going from synthetic to organic

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,939
you've done it and there are tons of

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,580
people out there that are making the

95
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,620
switch as well for a variety of reasons

96
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,140
right in this episode we're going to get

97
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,759
into your experience making that switch

98
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,878
we'll talk about your gross setup

99
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,679
environment conditions feedings and I

100
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,120
even want to get into problems that

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,060
you've come across and what you've done

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,739
to mitigate those problems but first can

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,060
we do an introduction can you tell us a

104
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,878
little bit about yourself and how you

105
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,039
got into gardening yeah man for sure um

106
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,959
I go by a lock box or my name is

107
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,359
actually Travis but uh I've always had

108
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,158
lockbox it's kind of a play on HotBox I

109
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,480
won't get too much into that but I'm

110
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,459
sure most of the audience will kind of

111
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,899
know what that is but uh I actually

112
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,079
didn't get into gardening at all because

113
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,879
I was around 19. um I'm 25 now so it's

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,519
still six years later till I got serious

115
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,139
about it but uh the very first intro to

116
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,879
gardening I ever had was probably like

117
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,139
the first or second grade elementary

118
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,360
school science

119
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,400
um we were germinating lima beans

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,780
actually and we use the paper towel

121
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,579
method which I think is really cool

122
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,198
actually that my teacher my science

123
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,779
teacher taught me that like a long time

124
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,280
ago yeah so my science teacher she uh

125
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,839
she taught us about the paper towel

126
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,459
method you know you put your your beans

127
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,739
and 20 of these are actually lima beans

128
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,379
actual beans people call them additional

129
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,120
plants beans I do for sure but uh had

130
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,579
the beans and the paper towels soaked in

131
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,780
with water put that paper towel inside

132
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,639
of a

133
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,379
paper plate you know paper plate on top

134
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,660
of it gave it plenty of Darkness put in

135
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,519
the cabinet for a few days whatever a

136
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,800
few days go by and behold you have a

137
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,539
root sticking out of there and uh as a

138
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
little kid it didn't really fascinate me

139
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,439
much at all I was like moving science

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,240
cool recess you know but uh fast forward

141
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,279
all these years and I'm getting into it

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,139
now and it's just the difference to it

143
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,478
now I see a route stick through on any

144
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,280
type of seed and it blows my mind man uh

145
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,839
I don't actually only grow medicinal

146
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,879
plants I'm getting into sage and other

147
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,198
types of herbs and just uh I don't want

148
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,600
to get too much into that right now but

149
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,520
just getting into gardening has some

150
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
additional plants it started it's just

151
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,579
grown medicinal plants for one reason

152
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,279
but it's turning into a whole nother

153
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,959
passion and just man I love gardening at

154
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,239
this point I love plants I love looking

155
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,219
at trees I love looking at flowers and

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
just seeing things grow in the

157
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,060
structurally different plants and like a

158
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,918
year ago two years ago three years ago

159
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,959
I'd have been like who is this guy man

160
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,698
talking about plants but that's just

161
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,519
kind of how it's happened for me

162
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,840
um and man I was uh I can't wait for the

163
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,339
future I don't plan to ever stop

164
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,060
gardening

165
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,619
um

166
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,418
but yeah dude that's kind of how it

167
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,160
happened for me it does the same way as

168
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,019
you you know started out which is

169
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,180
growing medicinal varieties and then

170
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,879
started growing my own food you know so

171
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,879
I never thought 10 years ago 15 years

172
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:18,418
ago that I would be growing lettuce kale

173
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,339
bok choy herbs all sorts of stuff Sparks

174
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,839
your interest to learn even more so

175
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,119
that's pretty cool that you were the

176
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,359
same way as me on that Avenue so

177
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,280
synthetic versus organic what is the

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
difference between synthetic and organic

179
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,258
okay um man that's a great question and

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,939
I like my answer for that a lot of

181
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,419
people may not like my answer for that

182
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,639
but to me the main difference is control

183
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,579
um and organic growing I think the

184
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,439
control lies within the plant whereas

185
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,659
synthetic growing the control lies

186
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,560
within the grower and what I mean by

187
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,139
that

188
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,879
um a lot of people reference organic as

189
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,918
like a battery you build a soil battery

190
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,139
you charge it up for the plant the plant

191
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,599
takes what it wants and that's great I

192
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,240
mean I love that to me I like Chinese

193
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,500
food I love buffets it makes it easier

194
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,199
for me to think it's like a Chinese

195
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,079
buffet I'm stalking this buffet with

196
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,180
food and the plant comes in and it sits

197
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,399
down and it wants some food so what does

198
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,560
that plant do it hollers at the waiter

199
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,779
hey waiter excuse me um I'd like some

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,459
orange chicken I think and if you bring

201
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,500
it to me I'll give you a two dollar tip

202
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,239
how does that sound and the waiter is

203
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,399
like dude that's great that's what I'm

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,199
here for it's my job I like it I got you

205
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,598
and it brings that plant to orange

206
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,460
chicken it eats it and in return it

207
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,800
gives it a two dollar tip and that is

208
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,019
like the root giving the extra date to

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,060
the microbe who is in return bringing

210
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,939
the orange chicken or the nutrient back

211
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,759
to the plant meanwhile I am sitting on

212
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,459
my couch watching television as in the

213
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,740
plant is in control so if I'm doing a

214
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,779
synthetic system that's not happening

215
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm walking to my channel every day I'm

216
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,719
looking at the plant I'm looking at my

217
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,239
bottles of nutrients and I'm thinking

218
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,460
okay this is what you're gonna eat I'm

219
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,460
mixing it at this strength quarter half

220
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,859
3 8 whatever you're gonna eat it and you

221
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,038
kind of have no choice and I hope you do

222
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,038
well and the plants just kind of taking

223
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,019
it man responding however it does and it

224
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,060
can't choose and it can't say I want

225
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,579
this I want that it can't choose the

226
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,519
ratios like it does inorganic it's just

227
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,598
kind of being force-fed so to say

228
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,939
waterboarded I've kind of come to look

229
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,159
at it may or may not be a good term for

230
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,500
it but uh yeah man the main difference

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,199
to me is control that's interesting way

232
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,658
to put it let's start with talking about

233
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,639
you using synthetics first all about

234
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,679
synthetics you know your experience with

235
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,718
it then we'll switch over to the organic

236
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,538
side of things so starting with the

237
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,339
synthetics when you used them what was

238
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,838
your gross setup talk to us about like

239
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,660
you know were you in a grow tent what

240
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,660
was your lighting container size we own

241
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,879
soil cocoa so on and so forth okay yeah

242
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:56,159
man um when I was running the synthetics

243
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,500
I was growing in a two by four tent uh

244
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:03,120
five foot height the light I had running

245
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,379
the tent it was a hlg 260 V2 R spec I

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,659
think 240 watt dimmable full spectrum

247
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:12,240
I had a four inch ventilation inline fan

248
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,419
kit set on the inside blowing the air

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,459
out negative pressure

250
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,159
um the light I never actually got it

251
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,739
above 70 in the tent and when it was at

252
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,319
70 percent that was maybe for like a

253
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,820
nine day maximum and uh I referenced

254
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,440
that because that was one of my problems

255
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,839
like we'll get into I was never actually

256
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,760
able to push the plants whether it be to

257
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,560
my maybe a lack of experience and

258
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,958
knowing how to push the plants properly

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,639
but I found the higher I turned the

260
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,359
light I just ran into more problems

261
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,399
deficiencies or just burns toxicities

262
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,580
um so yeah I always kept that lighter on

263
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,500
70 I keep uh I kept two fans in that

264
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,120
tent I say keep I'm still currently

265
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,159
running the exact same setup I'm looking

266
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,980
at it right now across the room but I

267
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,899
have two fans blowing in there one is on

268
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,759
the ceiling blowing above the light I

269
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,139
found that that hlg light puts off a lot

270
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,059
of heat actually compared to a spider

271
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,220
farmer I've got behind me but that's

272
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,838
beside the point but um it's blowing the

273
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,879
heat around in there another is on the

274
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,060
floor of the tent blowing the air around

275
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,519
there on the canopy and um

276
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,719
yeah um that's as far as I can think for

277
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,459
setup wise I don't know if I miss

278
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,920
anything in there trying to describe it

279
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,539
by looking at it environment conditions

280
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,000
that you usually aim for for like

281
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,899
temperature and humidity right um I

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,220
actually

283
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,480
it's kind of different than a lot of

284
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,278
people a lot of people put a lot of

285
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,920
effort and money into controlling that

286
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,899
and I wish I could one day I hope to

287
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,939
it's just not really in the cards for me

288
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,958
right now but both of my tents are in my

289
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,880
living room

290
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,879
um so it's always comfortable for my

291
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:45,240
family it's always

292
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,700
roughly 69 70 degrees in here Fahrenheit

293
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,320
in the living room and the humidity in

294
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,320
the living room is always between maybe

295
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,240
40 and 70 in the tents without uh

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,100
controlling or to doing anything for it

297
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,339
except for the ventilation and the fans

298
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,759
the temperature maximum on a hot summer

299
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:05,579
day is about 86 degrees Fahrenheit and

300
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,100
the minimum would be about maybe 69

301
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,659
degrees lights off it's getting colder

302
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,060
winter time it was like 26 degrees

303
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,679
outside a few weeks ago I don't know how

304
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,479
cold it got in one of the tents but the

305
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,639
plants they didn't look too good they

306
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,019
were sad so I guess it was pretty cool I

307
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,659
only have actually won a thermostat

308
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,259
between my two tenths super budget

309
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,819
growing over here so I imagine CO2 is is

310
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,838
something that you don't supplement as

311
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,760
well well yes but no not um I have a

312
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,740
propane heater right to my left over

313
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,200
here and uh

314
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,000
it might have been Bruce bugby or Dr

315
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,860
bugby I think he was talking about it or

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,259
maybe Jeff lowenpel is one of the two

317
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,659
but they said just the pilot light from

318
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,220
a heater like that just boost the

319
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,100
ambient CO2 levels in a room

320
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,019
considerably so I like to think without

321
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,200
doing anything I'm kind of supplementing

322
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,299
but actually no no I'm not yeah and one

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,180
thing I like to tell people is I live in

324
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,240
the house that I grow in and me exhaling

325
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,699
like we exhale CO2 I have two three cats

326
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,159
actually that exhale CO2 believe it or

327
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,980
not that actually contributes to the CO2

328
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,899
level especially when for for me I'm

329
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
taking the air from The Grow 10 I'm

330
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,339
exhausting that air out new air is

331
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,919
passively coming in from my house so

332
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,600
that's CO2 that I'm producing is uh

333
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,578
going into my grow tent and that is

334
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,019
sufficient it's uh it's actually funding

335
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,359
me that you say that you have the three

336
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,000
casting yourself um I have my wife and

337
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,039
my son who is a year old and man I love

338
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,679
him to death but that little dude likes

339
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:38,099
to scream and he likes to do all the

340
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,679
time so I'm imagining that in itself is

341
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,480
probably ample CO2 supplementation right

342
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,399
there for my son so shout out to the

343
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,920
baby grower thanks for helping me on

344
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,958
that one right there that's funny

345
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,360
so nutrient lineup what were you using

346
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,119
for your synthetic lineup and how did

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,180
you go about the feedings okay uh yeah

348
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,139
uh well for Meg I was using botanic hair

349
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,739
brand

350
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,740
um it was a CNS 17 grow I think was the

351
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,959
micros and a kind base was the macros or

352
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,799
maybe backwards on that right there but

353
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,199
um

354
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,519
I actually hardly even use these I

355
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,899
bought these bottles and I could

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,399
probably sell them to someone and tell

357
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,839
them they're full and outside of the

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,120
Caps being unsealed they wouldn't know

359
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,620
the difference because um even when I

360
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,659
was growing synthetic I've always grown

361
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,299
and at least Happy Frog or ocean for

362
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,100
soil and just the nutrients that's in

363
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:28,500
the soil already was enough to get me

364
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,440
through vegetation but I did start

365
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,700
introducing veg nudes usually the last

366
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,480
week of edge

367
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,459
um

368
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,259
and I would always start at quarter

369
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,939
strength you know if it called for four

370
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,799
milliliters a gallon I'm doing one

371
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,120
milliliter a gallon and you know busting

372
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,338
it down if I'm only making a liter

373
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,720
quarter milliliter which actually gets

374
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,399
really finicky and annoying on a

375
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,740
milliliter dropper than some of these

376
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,360
strange numbers but um I would start

377
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,278
there and just kind of watch the plant

378
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,740
and read the plant to tell me if it

379
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,200
needed more or less and like I said in

380
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,060
the veg only feeding late in the veg and

381
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,500
I would flip the lights and uh I would

382
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,479
actually keep feeding the imaginudes

383
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,159
through stretch I've read a lot of

384
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,659
people do that I've done it I like it

385
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,338
just for the nitrogen I'm liking to

386
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,199
think that the veg is kind of like it or

387
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,820
the stretch I'm sorry is like an

388
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,680
accelerated veg I know that's probably

389
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,540
incorrect because the hormones with the

390
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,338
flowering but I'm seeing a lot of stem

391
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:21,059
growth so I'm feeding it nitrogen veg

392
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,120
news and uh it's about week two and a

393
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,159
half maybe three I'll switch uh 12 12

394
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,459
you know flour I'll actually flip over

395
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:32,278
to my Blue Notes which um they are

396
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,559
Advanced Nutrients uh Scentsy Bloom A

397
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,059
and B totally different brand

398
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,679
um I was actually worried about that

399
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,299
when I bought my veg notes I had my

400
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,578
Bloom notes first from my previous run

401
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,740
and I went to buy imaginates and I

402
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,719
wanted to buy Scentsy grow A and B same

403
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,240
company same brand keep it all the same

404
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,160
you know avoid any kind of interactions

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
uh you hear all kinds of horror stories

406
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,419
online oh I put two different brands in

407
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
my plan now my plants falling apart I

408
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,278
don't know why chemical interactions and

409
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,139
I'm sure it's true and well I just

410
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,778
wanted to avoid that but I couldn't so I

411
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,000
got botanic hair Advanced Nutrients I

412
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,620
never saw any issues with that um or

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,559
maybe I did and I just couldn't pinpoint

414
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,899
that issue to that but as far as I knew

415
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,939
I couldn't tell but I would switch that

416
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,480
over and again I'm going back to quarter

417
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,560
strength on the flower notes um I found

418
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,240
that I actually

419
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,979
was able to use a lot more flower

420
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,480
nutrients than veg I guess because

421
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,399
they're eating a lot more feeding a lot

422
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,860
more between maybe weeks three and six

423
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,539
three through six a flower uh I've come

424
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,120
to know as the heaviest feeding weeks

425
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:35,338
but I never actually fed a plant over

426
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
three quarter strength nutrients I don't

427
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,680
think

428
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
um I always started to experience

429
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,578
problems though at that point you know

430
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:43,500
tips burn anger just toxicities or just

431
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:46,439
strange issues you know funky looking

432
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,519
leaves just imagine pH issues lockout

433
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,560
just

434
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,839
without actually looking inside of that

435
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,599
soil I feel like that's creating a mess

436
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,940
at that point so that's kind of a

437
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,240
scrambled mess on how I did my feedings

438
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,579
hope that works now did you monitor the

439
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,778
pH at all a lot of people do that when

440
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,159
they're growing with the synthetic

441
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,778
nutrients were you doing any sort of

442
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,958
monitoring the pH

443
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,578
uh yes I'm proud to say that is the one

444
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,179
thing I actually have been able to

445
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:18,000
monitor um I got myself a 45 I think

446
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,379
like Hydro Master pH man I loved it man

447
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
it was awesome

448
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,220
um I felt like a chemist like a

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,320
scientist I thought that was so cool I

450
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,180
was finally a grower getting in the grow

451
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,699
you know my thoughts have changed on

452
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:33,778
that sense but uh I was always aiming to

453
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:35,458
get between pH 6.0 and 7.0 um if it was

454
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,980
inside of those numbers I was happy with

455
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,599
it you know 6.1 6.9 I don't really care

456
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,600
like I said I'm growing in the Happy

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,699
Frog soil ocean Forest so even if it

458
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,060
being synthetic I'm imagining that soil

459
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:50,278
had enough pH buffering capabilities to

460
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,619
correct that at that point so between

461
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,019
six and seven I was happy um

462
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,659
there was a few times I tried to

463
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,220
pinpoint it 6.5 you know 6.5 it's all

464
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,620
the nutrients perfect in the Spectrum

465
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,459
you eat them all but dude every time I

466
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,160
try to do that I'd be 6.4 pH Up 6.7 PH

467
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,199
down up down I'll throw it away it's a

468
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,819
mess you know and I just get paranoid

469
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,539
I'm fixing to feed my plant the chemical

470
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:17,519
concoction and so maybe add two drops to

471
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:20,338
some distilled water get it right

472
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,099
between six and seven good to go yeah

473
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:25,558
measuring the ph and balancing it uh

474
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,240
it's time consuming you know I mean mix

475
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,940
up the nutrients and then balancing the

476
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,400
ph and then when you water in that

477
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,679
mixture a lot of people check the runoff

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,780
or they'll do some sort of slurry test

479
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,298
to make sure that they're in that range

480
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,639
that they want to be in six to seven pH

481
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,500
is the range that a lot of people go

482
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,679
after a lot of people that say that you

483
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,000
can go down at 5.5 5.5 to 7. and there's

484
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,620
some people that are saying you can even

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,660
go lower than that or higher than that

486
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:55,019
so there's certainly an optimal range

487
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,419
and then tolerance range so the plant

488
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:01,319
may still grow but it just might not be

489
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,580
optimal now how about PPM or EC that's

490
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,079
another measurement that a lot of people

491
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,659
track when they're growing with

492
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,178
synthetic nutrients did you have a TDS

493
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,660
tester were you measuring PPM or EC at

494
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,940
all or no no I sure wasn't I would have

495
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,519
liked to again but going back to wife

496
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,798
and son and first timer at the time this

497
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,379
budget I wasn't able to get that so like

498
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,179
I said I was eyeballing everything I

499
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,360
tried to learn to read the plant versus

500
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,940
read the PPM so again I was looking for

501
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,178
signs of stress you know just for if I

502
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,538
added too much tips burning or just dark

503
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,720
waxy just nitrogen toxicity or just Leaf

504
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:41,819
curling or just dry crusty soil or just

505
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,319
anything nasty seaming or on the flip

506
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,779
side of that you know if I was feeding

507
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,819
too light I'm looking for yellowing or

508
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,500
just man the plants lost its Vigor it

509
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,720
don't look happy the leaves aren't

510
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,220
praying and they're kind of sagging at

511
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,919
this point and just

512
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,798
so long story short no I didn't monitor

513
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,919
PPM with a number and a pen but I tried

514
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,779
to but I did water distilled actually um

515
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,640
so I knew I was starting at zero no

516
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,379
matter what that was one thing I kind of

517
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,880
did I stayed away from tap water at this

518
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,120
point in time because I have no idea

519
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,220
what's in it PPM wise or just I live out

520
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,719
in the country out here so my water man

521
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,640
sometimes it's like brown when it comes

522
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,980
out so there really is no telling I

523
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,620
don't know if it's 180 or shoot it could

524
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,480
be 600 PPM whereas if I don't know if

525
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,219
that's a reasonable number but so

526
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,660
they're still starting at zero and then

527
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,839
just watching the plant instead of

528
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,940
actually checking PPM and Sam Sam Tracy

529
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,639
got it yeah I'm in a similar situation

530
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,179
on my where my tap water is just so bad

531
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,759
I mean it comes in at like 485 PPM and

532
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,798
so I have to use Ro or some sort of

533
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,538
filtered water I elected to get an RO

534
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,119
system you know make the investment on

535
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:51,900
that 190 bucks or 200 bucks something

536
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,119
like that and it's beneficial for me now

537
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,400
a lot of people complain that you're

538
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,959
wasting water with that but I have my

539
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
drain line hooked up to a bucket and I'm

540
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,380
using on my outdoor plant so I'm not

541
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,419
wasting it but yeah water can certainly

542
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,559
be one of those things where if you

543
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,259
don't have a good water source your

544
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,240
plants won't be happy most definitely so

545
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,819
what problems did you come across when

546
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,980
growing with synthetic nutrients well

547
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,740
for problems mainly

548
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,019
um inducing toxicity the first time I

549
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,120
ever used a synthetic nutrients I read

550
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:24,240
the bottle I think I called for 16

551
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,639
milliliters a gallon I read online oh

552
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,038
don't do that start half and I thought

553
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,320
well shoot man I'll try maybe I'll get

554
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,298
lucky with this whole strength and well

555
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,298
uh automatically I could tell something

556
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,500
was wrong I feel like I'm just beating a

557
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,179
dead horse to keep saying burnt Leaf

558
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,240
tips but I just noticed they start

559
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,798
getting red and just start it's growing

560
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,859
and just um

561
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,918
the Clone too definitely experienced a

562
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:52,740
lot of leaf issues I never literally

563
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,059
checked the soil PPM or I'm sorry pH

564
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,919
runoff so I don't really know what was

565
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,678
going on in that Spectrum but I imagine

566
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,299
it was totally out of whack I wasn't phn

567
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,220
at this point in time when I was using

568
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:05,460
this whole strength I was relying on

569
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,620
Advanced Nutrients of pH perfect a

570
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,360
little slogan to oh my pH is going to be

571
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,599
perfect I don't need to check it so I

572
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,819
probably had PPM issues pH issues I mean

573
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:18,119
my rise a few was probably like a crazy

574
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,859
mess I mean my plants were just unhappy

575
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,839
to the point where I can't even tell you

576
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,599
what problems they were at some points

577
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,119
in my synthetic career you laugh like

578
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,918
you might know what I'm talking about

579
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,658
what I mean I've come across a wide

580
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,400
variety of problems when growing wood

581
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,520
sent that actually I mean it's so common

582
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,019
and it's so easy to make mistakes when

583
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,000
growing with synthetics in my opinion

584
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,259
but yeah it can be uh you can definitely

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,759
if you're doing it right you can

586
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,319
certainly come across with some really

587
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,179
healthy plants a lot of people these

588
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,918
days still still grow with synthetics

589
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,780
and have a lot of good results with it

590
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,360
and don't come across any problems right

591
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,099
well uh don't get me wrong there I had a

592
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,899
lot of issues with my synthetics but I

593
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,939
also did have a lot of great results too

594
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm not to like cute model horn or

595
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,240
anything but I don't want to make it

596
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,100
sound like it was just all negative I

597
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,679
actually love the synthetics I loved the

598
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:06,719
results I had the the buds I got were

599
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,340
just man the frostiest buds I've seen in

600
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,620
a while uh we're just going to Medicinal

601
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:13,678
stores around here I was just blown away

602
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,418
like I can grow this and it beats the

603
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,480
quality of this at this crazy process

604
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,280
and like so it was really good my only

605
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,319
main reason from straying away from it

606
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,298
you kind of mentioned it earlier was you

607
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,099
just said the time on the mix and the pH

608
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,319
that just kind of opens the door on my

609
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:29,939
reasons for switching but again like you

610
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,379
said you can get great results and I

611
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,120
have but I don't want to knock

612
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,159
synthetics by any means I'm not against

613
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,500
it I'm not live organic all the way I

614
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,179
like organic I like synthetic I like

615
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,240
them both they both have equal places

616
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,519
and um I'm all for either one it's just

617
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,140
I switched just for ease in you know but

618
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,000
yeah I definitely had some great results

619
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,919
and synthetics I was going to ask why

620
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,659
you switched was it just a Time Factor

621
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,980
yeast or was there other reasons to

622
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,100
making the switch from synthetic to

623
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,679
organic as well uh pretty much I'd say

624
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:00,839
it was like 95 time factor in ease

625
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,100
because I work in a factory

626
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,079
um right now we've actually cut hours

627
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:06,000
back to five six days a week but at the

628
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,699
time I was growing synthetics we were

629
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,519
doing seven days a week 12 hours a day 3

630
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,340
A.M to 3 P.M I live an hour away from my

631
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,740
job so I was home like eight nine hours

632
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,119
a day seven days a week and then I was

633
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,759
in my tank you know mixing up the

634
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,500
nutrients checking the PPM and my son's

635
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,599
in the background crying and my wife's

636
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,700
getting mad at me and it's just it was

637
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,798
all this I didn't have the time for it

638
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,140
but I wanted to keep on growing and that

639
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,599
wasn't an issue but the time spent just

640
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,700
having to do all these things was so I

641
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,099
started reading about uh Organics and

642
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,340
just amending and top dressing and just

643
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:44,699
dry amendments and don't pH just water

644
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:46,798
walk in walk away and so that was a huge

645
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,679
thing for me um I'm very fascinated

646
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:52,079
though by soil food web soil science

647
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,240
um I've always been very fascinated by

648
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,558
science and math the way I talk you

649
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,419
probably wouldn't guess it but I'd like

650
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,759
to uh consider myself an intelligent

651
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,280
person but I'm very fascinated by

652
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,019
microbes and just the soil food web who

653
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,940
we too and just the way that everything

654
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,639
interacts down there and just the way

655
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,620
the plants will secrete acids and sugars

656
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,419
and extra dates and just Wrangle up

657
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,339
these microbes and just how these

658
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,780
microbes will go out and work with the

659
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,759
nutrients and bring them to the plant

660
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,220
and that just they'll change their pH

661
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,259
and then this manual just fascinates me

662
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,240
so much how we just it's like an own

663
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,700
little world down there and just

664
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,558
everything and just I don't want to get

665
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,000
down and like I said earlier plants are

666
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,319
just watching them grow above the

667
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,700
surface just the different Leaf

668
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,678
structure and also just below the

669
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,659
surface man just every day I'm listening

670
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,759
to podcasts to and from work you I'm

671
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,840
listening to Jeff lowland fails just all

672
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,658
these different people talking about the

673
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,279
soil food web and just man it's so

674
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,200
fascinating to me it's I have so much

675
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,579
knowledge but it's all just I don't have

676
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,860
a lot of knowledge don't get me wrong I

677
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:51,899
said that wrong I

678
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,058
listen to all this knowledge and it's

679
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,400
just such a mess inside of my head like

680
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:59,038
it just comes out so fast and sputtered

681
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,559
but man it's just so fascinating to me

682
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,839
so that was a big reason also it's

683
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,460
fascinating to me as well and I think

684
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,319
that's a good segue into talking about

685
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,600
the organic side of things when you made

686
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,158
that switch and your experience and what

687
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,558
you've done on the organic side of

688
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,480
things so let me ask you first did you

689
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,000
grow setup change at all going to

690
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,599
organic or using the same grow tent

691
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,259
lighting container size did that change

692
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,319
um

693
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:27,900
everything for the most part the same uh

694
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,700
one biggest thing that changed in my

695
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,559
opinion was the lighting the light

696
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,819
itself didn't change in one tank it's

697
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,798
still the same hlg 260 V2 but um I was

698
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,200
actually able to increase the power like

699
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,400
I said I was never able to get 70 with

700
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,960
synthetics

701
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,700
um I didn't change the height for the

702
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,919
light I didn't change how the plants I

703
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,679
didn't change anything I did other than

704
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,240
just what I was feeding the plants and I

705
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,519
never had to reduce the light I never

706
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,859
saw leaves turning upside down I never

707
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,960
saw bleaching tips I never saw a heat or

708
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,839
light stress and it just it seemed like

709
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,179
I was able to put more into the plants

710
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,459
um with a little bit more light so that

711
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,259
was one way the setup changed um I got

712
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,058
another tent behind me since the time I

713
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,879
switched to Organics and that's a spider

714
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:15,359
former light sf2000 I believe it's 200

715
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,179
Watts not 240 like the hld I think it

716
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,519
has IR though um I think the hlg just

717
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,200
has four red this has four red and IR I

718
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,720
think don't get me wrong so that's a

719
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,179
light change

720
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,240
one one fan in the stand outside of two

721
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:33,360
but nothing major just small things just

722
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,940
here and there a lot sorry all right my

723
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,798
pots that's a big thing I forgot that I

724
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,320
was growing at fabric pots running

725
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,879
synthetics uh five gallon fabric I loved

726
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,798
it I thought it was the greatest thing I

727
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,960
was like plastic Plastics thing in the

728
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,579
past throw the plastic away this is what

729
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,798
it's about well I'll switch over to

730
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,839
organic and it's like wait dude get the

731
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,240
plastic back out of the trash my my soil

732
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,000
is drying out what's going on now so I'm

733
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,700
running a plastic pots now uh same five

734
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,400
gal I would like to go much larger the

735
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,259
five gallon is I feel like it's hands

736
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,340
around the throat of my organic grow

737
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,200
just

738
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,399
I actually I did a run in one gallon I

739
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,220
wouldn't want to get into that I tried

740
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,278
Organics in one gallon it was a terrible

741
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,720
two plants did really good one plant and

742
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:17,940
it was my favorite plant to the three

743
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,460
two but it was the whole growth stems

744
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,159
were so purple the leaves just yellow

745
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,038
and crumbly and brown they just was

746
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,720
crying for nutrients and so one gal

747
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,298
that's out of the question for me now

748
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,400
but uh five gallon plastic for my

749
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,440
organic pots interesting yeah you hear a

750
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,240
lot of people mention that the larger

751
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,778
the pot the better when it comes to

752
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,120
organic and uh so I actually myself I

753
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:44,038
just went from my I started out doing

754
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,778
Organics with the three gallons the five

755
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,119
gallons and then when I moved to the

756
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:49,500
seven gallons it was even easier now I

757
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,119
just got 10 gallons so I'm slowly

758
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,220
working my way up and I know some people

759
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,019
like 15 Gallons at the minimum or some

760
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,240
people might say 20 gallons at the

761
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,819
minimum but I'm working my way up I just

762
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,980
got some Grassroots fabric pots the ones

763
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,158
with the the fabric but they have the

764
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,579
liner on them so they don't dry out from

765
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,500
the sides like normal fiber pots do so

766
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,259
uh pretty cool I'm excited to start

767
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,058
using those but yeah I hope to see uh

768
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,798
see some better growth with the 10

769
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:19,019
gallons and make things a little bit

770
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,298
easier when it comes to adding the

771
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,579
inputs in there and and watering is a

772
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:27,119
big thing kind of being in a larger pot

773
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,500
less water I'm seeing of course it

774
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,899
depends there's so many variables right

775
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,339
like the size of the plant depends on it

776
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,759
right so obviously going to give less

777
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:37,859
water to a smaller plant in veg versus a

778
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,599
larger plant and flower dollar for

779
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,699
example so it's really hard to to speak

780
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,119
about water and say that I water less

781
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,340
but I kind of water less with with these

782
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,139
larger containers so that's a benefit in

783
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:51,178
my opinion hey I'm actually really glad

784
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,038
you brought that up though because I

785
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,278
totally forgot somehow over the summer I

786
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,480
did my first one only ever outdoor grow

787
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,240
um it started it was going to be water

788
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,460
only and I did these in 20 gallon pots

789
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,140
they were fabric actually I'm about 20

790
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,480
gallon fabric pots for whatever reason

791
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,520
but I actually went organic on this

792
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,679
Grill it was Happy Frog organic fruit

793
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,278
and flour acid loving plants fertilizer

794
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,259
but uh man it was awesome I watered at

795
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:17,759
first it was like every three days but

796
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,919
then it got hotter summer I was having

797
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,778
to water six gallons a day every single

798
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,700
day and even at that point the plants

799
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:25,980
were still looking dead every day at the

800
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,259
end of work but um yeah I did an organic

801
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,500
run in the 20 gallon pots and that was

802
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,839
probably the easiest run I've ever done

803
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,058
because those plants were as tall as me

804
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,038
and probably as wide as my tent right

805
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,359
here or I'm up here exaggerating I

806
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,398
probably am they're on my Instagram if

807
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,740
anyone wants to check them out but man

808
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,538
they were healthy they were huge and

809
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,000
they were healthy and they were green

810
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:50,700
and all they got was six gallons of

811
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,380
terrible tap water every single day but

812
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,080
that's all they needed with that organic

813
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,760
and that 20 gallon they did awesome and

814
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,619
I'm so glad you helped me remember that

815
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,000
thank you yeah I think generally

816
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,979
speaking for those folks that are going

817
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,500
from synthetic to organic you hear a

818
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,120
majority of people say to to start in

819
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,278
larger containers I think that that's

820
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,259
one of the beginner 101 from switching

821
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,200
from synthetic to organic now sir you

822
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:14,579
can do Organics in three gallons you can

823
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,679
do them in two gallons or one gallons

824
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,658
I've done them in but it's just it's a

825
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,700
little bit more difficult in my opinion

826
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,480
that the plant will

827
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,600
um

828
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,038
playing blue is more prone to show

829
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,178
deficiencies because it dries out you

830
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:29,220
know when you have a large plant a small

831
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,840
pot dries out quicker and with Organics

832
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,000
you need that Medium to be moist at all

833
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,220
times so the organic matter will break

834
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,319
down you know that process is happening

835
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,079
when things dry out microbes go dormant

836
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,178
and then that process stops and the

837
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,819
plant will start to get deficiencies so

838
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:46,200
being in a larger pot has been

839
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,119
beneficial now was there anything

840
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,220
different with your environment

841
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,739
conditions when you went to organic you

842
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,019
know temperature humidity CO2 or is it

843
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,120
all the same as synthetic

844
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,398
um it's all the same the only difference

845
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,839
is the synthetics they were kind of in

846
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:03,058
the summer the hotter ones of the Year

847
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,558
all my organic experience is kind of in

848
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:06,599
the winter in the colder months of the

849
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,278
year but I mean like I said on both my

850
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,599
tanks are in the living room so the

851
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,179
temperature really doesn't affect that

852
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,619
too much the humidity however though I

853
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,519
think it's been getting kind of drier

854
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,719
slowly I think that cold drinks dry um I

855
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,179
know my Knuckles and anxious and

856
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,980
starting to crack here lately but um so

857
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,778
that's kind of different but outside of

858
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,120
that everything is the same just kind of

859
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,099
what Mother Nature throws at me is what

860
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,500
kind of what goes on my tank say uh

861
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,778
outdoor version of my indoor growing got

862
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,000
it now what about organic fertilizer and

863
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:37,859
amendments what are you using and how do

864
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,679
you go about adding them into the system

865
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:43,019
right I mentioned earlier that Happy

866
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,059
Frog fruit and flower acid loving plants

867
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,579
I brought one bag of that it was cool

868
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:50,038
but uh not really fetched the sense what

869
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,619
I'm using now is a Gaia green organic

870
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,658
dry amendments man I love this stuff um

871
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,699
you get me talking about it I feel like

872
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,260
a promotion guy for them shoot I'd ask

873
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,778
them for it they'd probably say no so

874
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:04,019
don't take that but man diodrine is

875
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:07,319
awesome I use the all-purpose 444 I use

876
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:10,500
their power Bloom 284 and their glacial

877
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,359
rock dust that's a crazy Awesome Trio in

878
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,919
my opinion you can get it online

879
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,139
um that's what I did a lot of people

880
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,759
were talking about it and uh

881
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,679
man it's awesome

882
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,720
um how I go about using it

883
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,480
um I start all my plants in Solo cups

884
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,159
and a happy frog or ocean Forest I don't

885
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,778
add anything at this point just straight

886
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,760
soil at this point

887
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,798
um I'll let them go about two weeks

888
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,898
probably until the leaves are all going

889
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,879
outside the cup pretty well I know the

890
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:38,158
roots can hold that soil well and we'll

891
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,500
transfer them transplant them into one

892
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,140
gallons and uh when I do that I'll mix

893
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,679
the soil with three tablespoons of

894
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,140
all-purpose uh 444 and one tablespoon of

895
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,659
rock dust I'll let them grow out in that

896
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,460
for a few weeks um depending on how long

897
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,620
I'm going to veg them in that pot if I'm

898
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,000
planning to transplant them in two weeks

899
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:58,918
I'll go ahead and Transplant them

900
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,259
another two weeks from that point into

901
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,679
their five gals and I'll mix that with

902
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:07,259
three tablespoons per gallon of a two to

903
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,480
one ratio of a power Bloom do all

904
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:12,058
purpose so for a five gallon that'd be

905
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,278
like 10 tablespoons power Bloom to a

906
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:15,960
five tablespoons all-purpose and that's

907
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,119
to account for uh I'm fixing to flip the

908
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,860
lights the flower I always like to set

909
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,199
my lights to flower about a week after I

910
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:25,558
transplant give the roots some strength

911
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,360
the space to grow and time but um that

912
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,678
nutrient ratio I think gives them kind

913
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,119
of the all-purpose to get through that

914
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,100
stretch in the Mage and then just that

915
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,898
power Bloom to really take off into

916
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:36,298
flowering and uh

917
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:38,158
or if I'm gonna veg for four weeks I'll

918
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:39,538
top dress them maybe after two weeks and

919
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,179
then do the same thing transplant after

920
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:44,339
four uh same thing into the five gal and

921
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,960
then just top dress some every two to

922
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,298
four weeks depending on how that plant's

923
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,819
doing what I'm seeing sometimes I'll

924
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:54,359
talk U.S just wrong dust or maybe power

925
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:56,460
Bloom I'm really not do this at a

926
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,139
specific time or a soil scientist or

927
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,220
maybe I need to be I don't really know

928
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,840
what I'm doing for the most part I'm

929
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,278
just kind of adding stuff when I see it

930
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,778
but I know that's not how you do

931
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:05,038
Organics when you're seeing something I

932
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:08,159
know you're like eight or nine days

933
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,898
behind from the actual problem so I try

934
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
to not actually see problems I try to

935
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:13,199
always stay above that that's why I

936
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,480
follow that two to four week regimen I

937
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,658
found um that keeps them healthy for the

938
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,639
most part I do occasionally see calcium

939
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,280
issues or magnesium issues you know the

940
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,399
rust or the red and the Browning for

941
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,500
that I'm actually using Epsom salt just

942
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,179
Dr teals got it from Walmart pure Epsom

943
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,219
salt none of that other crazy stuff

944
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,858
cocoa butter nothing but that's for the

945
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,319
Magnesium maybe one two tablespoons

946
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:38,819
every week or two

947
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,619
calcium I would like to get some gypsum

948
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,820
I haven't actually got around to it

949
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,000
that's what everyone always talks about

950
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,740
for that but um that's not how I go for

951
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,760
my feedings um top dressing or

952
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:52,378
transplanting every two to four weeks or

953
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,540
so that's pretty straightforward so with

954
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:56,940
Organics you're not actually adding in

955
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,800
that to water like you are with

956
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,720
synthetics right so it's just your top

957
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,060
dressing and then you're adding water on

958
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,980
top of that top dressing now how do you

959
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,358
do waterings how do you go about doing

960
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,800
your waterings I should ask you this on

961
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,179
the synthetic side of things how were

962
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,660
you doing it when you were using

963
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:14,279
synthetic nutrients versus organic okay

964
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:15,838
uh yeah that's a great question actually

965
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,700
but that's a totally different

966
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,559
philosophy and practice in my opinion

967
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:22,379
when I was doing synthetics I was

968
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,480
following the uh forsaken dry back

969
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,820
method you know you water the pot you

970
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,119
lift it it's so heavy you wait till it's

971
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,820
40 30 20 of that weight you know bone

972
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,980
dry then you add water I've actually

973
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,660
gone so far is letting the plant go

974
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,639
until it looked like it was dead and

975
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:40,980
it's not coming back and then I gave it

976
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,960
water and just I don't plan on ever

977
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,579
doing that again but watching that plant

978
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,920
come back and down ounce back in an hour

979
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,660
it was awesome

980
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,338
that kind of helped me learn to not over

981
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,259
water when I was learning to do

982
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:54,299
synthetics just to see how much better

983
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,280
underwater and would be in that regard

984
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,019
than over watering but um yeah

985
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,880
synthetics I was watering letting it dry

986
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:02,579
back completely adding more water

987
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,079
switching to Organics totally different

988
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,760
like you mentioned earlier if you don't

989
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,579
want that dryness you don't want micro

990
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,140
dormancy you don't want the land to go

991
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,700
dry you don't want to experience a

992
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:14,219
drought you know you don't want that you

993
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,439
want there to be life and moisture so

994
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,118
for that I'm watering a lot more

995
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,420
frequent than I would have ever been in

996
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,579
synthetics you know if synthetic me saw

997
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,139
organic meat watering I'd be like dude

998
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,000
over watering what are you doing man

999
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,739
you're about to cause so many issues for

1000
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,079
yourself because there will be times I'm

1001
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:32,759
watering every single day and synthetics

1002
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,519
that was like I'd slap myself like what

1003
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,740
are you doing dude but um actually build

1004
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,019
this oil man I love build this oil

1005
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,659
um I wanted his YouTube videos I learned

1006
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,759
from him uh he said five to ten percent

1007
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,519
for watering or organic living soil

1008
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,320
whether it be every day or every two to

1009
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,320
three days that's what you want to water

1010
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,059
for you know that and um so if I'm going

1011
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,680
in a one gallon POD at a time I'm

1012
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,559
watering probably

1013
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,659
400 milliliters if it's a big vigorous

1014
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,400
plant and depending on how long it's in

1015
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,379
that pot how big it is that might be

1016
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,139
every single day like you said you want

1017
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,140
to stop that drive back or or I'm sorry

1018
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:12,179
just stop it from going dry but watering

1019
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,098
organic I'm probably watering every day

1020
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:16,679
whether it's a little bit or a lot just

1021
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:19,019
depending on that plant the soil where I

1022
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,539
think it's at but always trying to keep

1023
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:23,940
it moist I don't want any uh drought

1024
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:26,039
yeah that makes sense yeah there's a big

1025
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,500
difference and I used to do the same uh

1026
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,358
well I still do the same dry back method

1027
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,039
there's actually some benefits to doing

1028
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,539
the dry backs specifically with

1029
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,460
synthetics you can certainly get away

1030
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,619
with it so I still do that method to

1031
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,780
this date and the watering it would be

1032
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,960
water till runoff right so you'll slowly

1033
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,700
water in and then it will go through the

1034
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,500
medium then you'll get that runoff and a

1035
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,739
lot of people do testing of that the pH

1036
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,079
PPM and so on and so forth both Organics

1037
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:55,259
it's often said you shouldn't have that

1038
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,079
runoff because in that runoff is usable

1039
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,640
nutrients the plant so if you do get any

1040
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,200
type of runoff a lot of people what

1041
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,539
they'll do is they'll keep it in that

1042
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,838
plant saucer and they'll let it soak

1043
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:08,338
upwards so um yeah I do that same way

1044
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:10,320
and then the five percent rule with

1045
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:12,119
Organics I think is pretty cool that you

1046
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,180
mentioned that that's one thing that I

1047
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,920
heard from him as well and I practice

1048
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:19,139
Yeah I mean having those small amounts

1049
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,000
and watering more frequently helps to

1050
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:22,920
ensure that you don't over water

1051
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,199
and if you're seeing that you're doing a

1052
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,960
five percent of water according to your

1053
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,939
container size and the plant needs more

1054
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,380
water well then 24 hours later next time

1055
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,119
you check in on your plants for example

1056
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,900
you can give them another five percent

1057
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,400
so moving on to PPM or eec I think you

1058
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,559
said you didn't you don't have a meter

1059
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,539
you didn't adjust you didn't monitor it

1060
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,799
with synthetics same thing with Organic

1061
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:46,679
so you just completely kind of hands off

1062
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,720
when it comes to EC or PPM right yeah

1063
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,539
same thing just hands-off approach just

1064
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,039
kind of putting the water in just hoping

1065
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:56,460
for the best not knowing what's inside

1066
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,380
of it but yeah no meter so

1067
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,059
um one thing I do know though I've heard

1068
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,858
a lot of people talking about you

1069
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,019
mentioned earlier checking the PPM or

1070
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:06,059
the pH of runoff I've read about a lot

1071
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:07,679
of people checking the PPM of organic

1072
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:09,779
runoff which I know is a very

1073
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,399
controversial topic because

1074
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,560
um I know when there is runoff in

1075
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,720
Organics there's all kinds of stuff in

1076
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,179
that water all kinds of organic material

1077
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:20,338
that'll play a part of that PPM that's

1078
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,919
not actually a nutrition or nutritional

1079
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:25,139
matter inside of that water content so I

1080
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,639
don't but um just for people out there

1081
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,739
if that's something you're hearing about

1082
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,118
online just some bad information me

1083
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:32,399
personally I don't think you really need

1084
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,920
to worry about organic PPM unless you're

1085
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,720
actually watering into the plant then I

1086
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,300
mean there's still some some play to

1087
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,098
look there but uh no I don't actually

1088
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,320
check into that at all I think a vast

1089
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,140
majority of the people just ignore it I

1090
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,660
also ignore it I just uh just top dress

1091
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:50,219
and water in so and the plants turn out

1092
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:53,039
to be fine all right the beauty of

1093
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:55,679
organic how about cover crops do you use

1094
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,358
any of those uh no not at this point in

1095
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,500
time I'm looking at it in the future

1096
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,960
actually

1097
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,280
um I'm very interested in oregano or

1098
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,980
just other kind of herbs like that

1099
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,019
that'll have a pest deterrence property

1100
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,639
um I think you use a clover blend if I'm

1101
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:10,380
not mistaken like a four clover blender

1102
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,460
you have in the past I think I've seen

1103
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,900
in your videos

1104
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,820
um I'm kind of been interested by that

1105
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,039
I've always just been fascinated or just

1106
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,260
the look of that kind of living soil

1107
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,900
just I love the look of a bed like a

1108
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,760
four by four living swirl bed with the

1109
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,039
Moss and just the cover crops and it

1110
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,220
looks like just some soil floors like

1111
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,960
forest floor inside of a tent so one day

1112
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,358
I plan to use cover crops right now I'm

1113
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,760
not but it is in the future for me and

1114
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,960
that's for several reasons uh nitrogen

1115
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,380
fixation

1116
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,900
um chop and drop just look kinda all

1117
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,519
sorts of reasons but is in the future

1118
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,960
yeah I use the white Dutch Clover

1119
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,759
actually came up caused some negative

1120
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,559
impacts that white Dutch Clover can have

1121
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,960
which is one of the main things is

1122
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,820
thrips actually feed off of white touch

1123
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,260
Clover so I think I'm just going to use

1124
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,760
up the rest of it what I have and then

1125
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,700
just stop using it because I don't want

1126
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,800
thrips no definitely not how about most

1127
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,358
layers do you use those at all when

1128
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,220
growing organically

1129
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,799
um I've tried a bit of a multi-layer um

1130
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:10,799
using worm or not warm compost mushroom

1131
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,380
compost just like a two inch layer just

1132
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,839
mainly to help try to keep that soil uh

1133
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,400
moist and just kind of give Darkness I

1134
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,920
don't have a lot of knowledge and

1135
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,838
mulching or most layers but

1136
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,000
I've done it a little bit but I don't

1137
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,739
really have a lot to speak on it but it

1138
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,780
was just about a two inch layer of

1139
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:30,899
mushroom compost I had good results

1140
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,519
doing it um I can't say for sure though

1141
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,099
that it negatively or positively

1142
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,259
impacted it I do feel I had to water a

1143
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,500
bit less though um which was definitely

1144
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:44,220
a plus so how about worms do you use

1145
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,960
those at all worms uh again no um I feel

1146
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:48,179
like everything's just a no no no for me

1147
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,338
here in the future I plan to

1148
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:52,858
um I definitely want to get into worm

1149
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:55,739
compost and get my own worm compost bin

1150
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:58,920
um the main reason I'm not right now for

1151
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:02,039
worm compost is just my house it's uh in

1152
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,500
the country it's very old house I don't

1153
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,960
have like pest issues but there very

1154
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,579
easily could be pest issues so I'm just

1155
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,019
kind of staying away from that just I

1156
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,300
feel like that's an easy way to invite

1157
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:15,059
problems um I think my house is like

1158
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,220
naturally loaded with mites um the kind

1159
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:19,858
of Natalie rotting wood as well as

1160
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:22,078
living plants I think Rod mites May

1161
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:23,880
maybe the little orange ones they look

1162
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,579
just like spider mites I don't know but

1163
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,440
I try to stay away from anything uh too

1164
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,240
bug related at the moment

1165
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,338
um I had a bad running my very first

1166
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,439
girl ever with spider mites it was a

1167
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:36,838
clone I had got so I don't know if they

1168
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,720
came from the Clone or from my house but

1169
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:41,460
uh that just left a very bad taste in my

1170
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,919
mouth so if it's a bug I try to stay

1171
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,199
away from it but getting into organic

1172
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,300
it's not the way of thinking at all it's

1173
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,598
kind of backwards

1174
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,579
um organic is life and diversity so like

1175
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,440
I said in the future I plan to but at

1176
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,300
this point in time I can't really say

1177
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,099
anything on that no I'm actually kind of

1178
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,839
glad you're saying no no no the cover

1179
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:02,519
crops mulch layers and worms because

1180
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,519
that just goes to show that you can do

1181
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,440
Organics without that stuff I think a

1182
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,358
lot of new folks are intimidated like I

1183
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,519
don't want to deal with the worms or

1184
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,098
cover crops I don't really know about

1185
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,480
that so I'm just not gonna do Organics

1186
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:18,599
they think it's a requirement but really

1187
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,579
it's not you don't have to right it's

1188
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,838
beneficial I feel like that's like kind

1189
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,359
of the next level where you start off

1190
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,980
maybe top dressing organic inputs then

1191
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,539
maybe you're planting in some cover

1192
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,920
crops and maybe you're doing a mulch

1193
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,019
layer then maybe you're adding in worms

1194
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,599
different stages I guess you could say

1195
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,280
but uh it's certainly not a requirement

1196
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,619
to do those things when growing

1197
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,119
organically man uh that's actually super

1198
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,559
awesome I'm very happy to hear you say

1199
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,358
that because I actually have the same

1200
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,279
thoughts um I feel like I've been

1201
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:47,159
getting pretty good results with not a

1202
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,019
lot of experience not a big budget not a

1203
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,838
lot going into it and a lot of new

1204
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:54,239
people man I'm on THC farmer a lot The

1205
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,039
Forum and I saw some guy posted a thread

1206
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,338
hey this is how you do your first grow

1207
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,980
and it was like a freaking novel 10

1208
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:05,279
paragraphs of go out buy this that and

1209
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,858
this do this that and this I'm like dude

1210
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,780
I don't plan to ever buy half of that in

1211
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:12,059
my entire life and I don't want that to

1212
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,460
discourage a lot of new Growers I want

1213
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:16,559
someone like me to kind of not get seen

1214
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,619
but just kind of spread that you can get

1215
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,019
results with nothing not nothing but I

1216
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,059
mean it doesn't take all of this extra

1217
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,280
inputs like you're saying to make it

1218
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,318
happen you know it definitely helps and

1219
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,420
I definitely be doing better with it but

1220
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,119
I'm getting by just fine and a lot of

1221
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,039
people can be too so for sure man for

1222
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,079
sure yeah absolutely

1223
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,119
how about microbes a lot of people use

1224
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,339
microbial inoculants you know whether it

1225
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,500
be like Mammoth P or recharge or there's

1226
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,980
so many micro products out there do you

1227
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,800
use those at all favorite word no

1228
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,119
um I wish I could dude I really do I was

1229
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,519
actually in my grow store yesterday

1230
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,220
asking about recharge and they looked it

1231
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,719
up real Growers recharge 80 bucks you

1232
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,659
know and I was like

1233
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,879
see you later wish I could but uh so I'm

1234
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:05,159
not doing that what I am doing though is

1235
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,800
I'm making some compost teas to try to

1236
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:10,639
inoculate with some microbial life

1237
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,260
however my compost teas or maybe poison

1238
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,659
because I don't have a pump I don't have

1239
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,540
air Stones it's literally a 24 hour

1240
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:20,159
process of annoyance for me

1241
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:22,318
um I'm stirring that thing every 30

1242
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,779
minutes except for when I fall asleep it

1243
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,338
might go two three four hours but I'm

1244
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,980
doing the uh

1245
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:30,719
like a Whirlpool Whirlpool method I

1246
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,699
learned where you just stir the crap out

1247
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,858
of it and you get like a Vortex going to

1248
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:37,139
the bottom which in theory is sucking

1249
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:40,440
oxygen into that water into that mixture

1250
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:42,900
and um hopefully I've been creating some

1251
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,880
microbial inoculants in that form or

1252
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,220
maybe I've just been killing my plants

1253
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,260
slowly I don't know but I don't haven't

1254
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:51,419
purchasing any inoculant products but

1255
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,339
I've been trying my best at doing it

1256
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,539
um from scratch well the compost teas

1257
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:56,699
you mentioned can certainly be

1258
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:59,338
beneficial as a microbial inoculant and

1259
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:01,559
some can argue that it's more beneficial

1260
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:03,420
than using a microbial inoculant because

1261
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,578
microbial inoculants it's so limited to

1262
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,740
the amount of diversity that's included

1263
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,780
in those bottles right I'm not saying

1264
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,000
that's it's bad that you should use them

1265
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,400
but uh you can certainly get more

1266
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,039
diverse set of microbes coming from

1267
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,740
compost or even going into your backyard

1268
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,019
and doing the IMO process talking about

1269
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:24,118
natural farming being able to get those

1270
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:25,800
indigenous microorganisms and then bring

1271
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,780
them into your garden you could get a

1272
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,640
lot more diverse to do that way so so

1273
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,319
yeah that's cool to hear that you're

1274
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:33,239
experimenting with the teas and trying

1275
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:35,699
to boost up your diversity there yeah

1276
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,799
yeah absolutely so problems everybody

1277
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,299
comes across problems right what

1278
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,700
problems have you come across when

1279
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,160
switching over to organic

1280
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:46,199
um definitely watering oh at first

1281
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,779
watering game you're going for my money

1282
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,519
um between underwatering and just

1283
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,380
letting it dry out too much and seeing

1284
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,000
issues there and then on the flip side

1285
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,039
over watering

1286
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,300
um just kind of keeping it muddy which I

1287
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,219
actually haven't had nearly as much

1288
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,200
issue as I thought I would with over

1289
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:02,578
watering but I think I probably still

1290
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,439
have done it

1291
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,839
um I mentioned I've done a one gallon

1292
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,639
organic and that was dude that was just

1293
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,519
a run of problems like that whole grow

1294
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,279
was a problem for three plants one did

1295
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:16,199
okay smallest of the three two was like

1296
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,819
and one was like I don't even want to

1297
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,679
say it was my plan it was like a walking

1298
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:21,719
problem I mean I do I love the plant

1299
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,500
yeah in the one gallon the biggest

1300
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,818
problems was just a lack of soil uh lack

1301
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,599
of battery I guess going back to that

1302
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:29,460
battery

1303
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,599
um it's very easy to eat through

1304
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,240
nutrition

1305
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,859
um a big thing I've learned lately is

1306
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:37,139
the law of return you know you're

1307
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,299
constantly taking from the soil the

1308
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:40,739
plants taking from the soil we're taking

1309
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,960
from the plant and in this little one

1310
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,879
gallon there's not a lot being put back

1311
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,159
into it I've been top dressing into it

1312
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,660
and feeding into it but just the amount

1313
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:51,358
that that plant's taking just threw it

1314
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:53,699
off and just just lack of nutrients is a

1315
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,259
huge problem in that regard but uh

1316
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,118
when you're growing in an actual pot

1317
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,099
that's capable of handling this battery

1318
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,140
and it's capable of charging up this

1319
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,838
plant really not a lot of problems I've

1320
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:06,059
had um springtails had a big old

1321
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,559
springtail thing but I don't really I

1322
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:09,000
didn't actually see it as a problem you

1323
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,799
know at first it alarmed me I was like

1324
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,019
oh my God you know this hole is crawling

1325
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,700
but I kind of I've heard about them

1326
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:16,679
before I'd known about them so I wasn't

1327
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:18,179
really worried I know that they'll break

1328
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,039
down organic matter and actually turn

1329
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:22,019
into nutrients I think for the plants so

1330
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,059
they could actually be beneficial but I

1331
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,280
mean still that's just bugs so still

1332
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,799
kind of one on my problem list but um

1333
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,019
it's really all I can think so far for

1334
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,119
problems I mean have you had any under

1335
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,759
feeding issues like seeing any

1336
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,740
deficiencies or anything or seeing like

1337
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,660
lower yield a lot of people say once you

1338
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:41,759
switch over Organics you'll initially

1339
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,039
see a lower yield compared to synthetics

1340
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,839
have you seen that at all

1341
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,480
um as far as deficiency isn't under

1342
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,400
feeding yes but that was usually with

1343
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,679
the smaller pots and Transplant thing

1344
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,980
that was just towards the end of a like

1345
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:58,440
a two or four weeks cycle so I tried to

1346
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,179
stay like I sang with these Cycles above

1347
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,260
that so I don't see that but I did run

1348
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,879
into that

1349
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,980
um still trying to get it down with the

1350
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,420
dry amendments I know um it takes

1351
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,858
several weeks to actually be broken down

1352
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,079
so I'm trying to get that timing down

1353
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:12,000
and usually if I am seeing deficiencies

1354
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,579
it's like a magnesium or a calcium I'm

1355
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,800
seeing rust spots or just the yellowing

1356
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,500
with the intervanial chlorosis and just

1357
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,359
the crumbling dry edges

1358
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,818
um not too much though as far as yield

1359
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,980
goes um okay so technical difficulties

1360
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:27,838
once again I apologize I think that's a

1361
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,000
sign that we need to wrap things up it

1362
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,338
has been it's been almost an hour

1363
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,199
anyways and we've gotten through just

1364
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:36,480
about everything I wanted to so tell us

1365
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,519
how can the listeners find you and what

1366

um if anyone wants to find me I'm on

1368
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,480
Instagram it's a lock box grows all one

1369
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,880
word pretty easy to find profile picture

1370
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,159
is me holding two plants just like that

1371
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,318
you can't miss it um if you're on THC

1372
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,578
farmer and find me is lockbox

1373
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,858
um I don't guess a lot of people

1374
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,760
probably are though but uh in the future

1375
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:59,098
man

1376
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,020
um well actually I turned 25 tomorrow in

00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,059
Oklahoma you got to be 25 to get a

1378
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:05,099
commercial grower license I'm not saying

1379
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:08,099
that's what I'm gonna do but that door

1380
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,440
is opening up for me it's a possibility

1381
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:12,960
um a whole lot of growing a whole lot of

1382
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,579
plants and just loving doing it man

1393
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,400
your methods of growing whether you grow

1394
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:37,199
synthetic how do you do it was it

1395
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,059
different than what Travis has said here

1396
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,279
and organic there are so many different

1397
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:43,259
ways to go about it how do you grow with

1398
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,519
what inputs do you grow with do you do

1399
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,319
watering the same or do you do

1400
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,759
differently so on and so forth love to

1401
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,699
hear that down in the comments section

1402
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,319
below Travis lockbox thanks so much for

1404
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,880
difficulties we had I still think it was

1405
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,640
a valuable conversation got to learn

1406
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,960
more about you how you do things and uh

1407
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,879
yeah appreciate you coming on the
