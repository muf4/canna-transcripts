00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,438
about in your introduction here but

55
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,618
before the introduction let's reveal the

56
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,239
topic organic gardening versus

57
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:03,239
Hydroponics so you've done both methods

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,060
and I'm really interested to hear how

59
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,459
you've grown those ways tips tricks

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,840
stuff like that but first can you

61
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,979
introduce yourself tell us a little bit

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,459
about yourself and how you got into

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,400
gardening sure my name is Adam Dunn and

64
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,739
I've been into gardening now for 30 plus

65
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,539
years it looks like it's it's crazy how

66
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,599
time flies right

67
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,359
um I when I was growing up my dad my dad

68
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,780
my grandfather was a head groundskeeper

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,580
at La golf course so we had the greenest

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,959
lawn in the in the block you know it's

71
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,400
like you come down our street it was all

72
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,159
crabgrass everywhere except for our

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,500
house perfectly Green Grass and uh but

74
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,479
he had a really always had a good garden

75
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,419
and kind of you know Greek Greek

76
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,799
Heritage you know so they tend to love

77
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,839
to have their little Victory Gardens

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
still so that was back in New England

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,400
which is an amazing place for growing

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
anything really has a you know it's

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,980
different right we're out here in

82
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,959
Colorado now it's dry and there's very

83
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,238
like quite limiting on certain things

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,640
you can do and I go back to east coast

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,439
and see my friends growing pumpkins and

86
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,878
things and just like wow the corn you

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,340
know just all the different like just

88
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,620
the quality of the of the vegetables and

89
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
things coming out of there is amazing so

90
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,800
that's a big difference I was born and

91
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,439
raised in Massachusetts and now I live

92
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,780
in same thing in Las Vegas a massive

93
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,219
difference exactly the same Vibe

94
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,900
differently exactly because it's just

95
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,340
like you know the lack of humidity makes

96
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,400
a huge difference that's one thing

97
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,140
you're just like here in Colorado we are

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,819
constantly battling that you know

99
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,039
there's never enough water yeah it's

100
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,018
very dry out there similar to how it is

101
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,639
where I live so what about your show how

102
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,840
did that all come about

103
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,539
um you know like like a lot of things

104
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,319
evolution of uh of uh

105
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:45,658
you know I I came to Colorado in 2010

106
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:50,639
from I lived in Amsterdam for 21 years

107
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:52,378
and so I came here in 2010 and uh

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,759
you know that I was on a lot of other

109
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,579
people's shows I was on the John Doe

110
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,620
radio show which is uh was like a local

111
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,459
uh show here in Colorado and it was

112
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,200
really

113
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,439
instrumental I think because it really

114
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,539
like his show was like a beacon that

115
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,039
brought people to Colorado because they

116
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,239
were like I can't believe this is

117
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,158
happening you know what I mean so they

118
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,099
all came out to see the changes

119
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,199
happening in Colorado and I rolled into

120
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,539
town and I was like yeah I'll come on

121
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,978
your podcast and hung out with them a

122
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,919
bit and I realized I really like quite

123
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,959
liked the I like the format I got a lot

124
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,279
to say I got a lot of stories you know

125
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,439
what I mean after living there for so

126
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,418
long and really felt like it was a good

127
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,040
good medium to work with and now it's

128
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,198
been 10 years it's crazy it goes so

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,639
again like time flies right so all of a

130
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,639
sudden it's 10 years later and we're

131
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,100
still rocking and rolling and it's great

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,939
it's a great um I think as you know

133
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,979
podcasting right now is is like the last

134
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:49,680
sort of free creative place to be you

135
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,060
know like as long as you're not you know

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
working for somebody else if you're

137
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,759
doing your own thing you can create your

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
own lane which is

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
rare in this world you know what I mean

140
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,379
there's very few things that you can

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
actually do that with so I feel like

142
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,120
podcasting is a great way to get to

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,100
people and connect on a real level

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
and uh yeah I love the I love the no

145
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,479
rules part that's my favorite that's

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,860
awesome and for those tuning in uh

155
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,538
on like nine different platforms now we

156
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,459
go through restream so they go on on all

157
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,659
of them you know and uh it's been it's

158
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,159
actually the numbers have been going

159
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,660
crazy too it's like I've been you know I

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,180
I really don't pay attention to those

161
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,300
things and I'm not really like beholden

162
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,860
to numbers and trying to get higher you

163
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,478
know viewership and stuff but what we

164
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,819
have noticed is you know just

165
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,219
organically it's grown over time and now

166
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,538
we're hitting like you know 150 000 a

167
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,639
month or something like that on average

168
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,439
which is you know really good because if

169
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,660
you could just imagine 150 000 people in

170
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,740
one place it's it's quite a good crowd

171
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
you know what I mean you start getting

172
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,340
those crowds together you're like all

173
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,680
right we're getting somewhere yeah

174
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,839
congrats on all your success that's not

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,660
easy to do at all so that's a huge

176
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,739
accomplishment there yeah I think the

177
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,820
key the key to the whole thing if

178
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,680
anybody out there is listening and they

179
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,560
want to start a podcast number one thing

180
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,360
is be consistent right don't don't think

181
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,620
you can do one and then wow maybe a few

182
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,979
months later I'll do another one nobody

183
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,139
no nobody they want to see you on you

184
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,339
know like we literally we missed a

185
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,319
couple here and there but it's always

186
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,818
been just you know major circumstances

187
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,100
but for the most part it's always like

188
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,600
you feel it in your heart like I gotta I

189
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,800
gotta do this man I gotta be there and

190
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,960
they're waiting on me you know what I

191
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,460
mean so it's a good feeling I can vouch

192
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,198
for that as well consistency is

193
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,779
definitely key when it comes to that oh

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
100 worst thing is when somebody says oh

195
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,899
is that podcast still on you're like

196
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,579
what every week yeah so you want to make

197
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,918
sure people know yeah

198
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,198
so let's get into our topic today I want

199
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,180
to start with Hydroponics I'd like to

200
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,919
know to begin what hydroponic systems

201
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,079
are you familiar with and what ones have

202
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,000
you used in the past

203
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,219
so when I was living in Holland actually

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,019
so when I moved there in 89 it was like

205
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,479
you know that is like the

206
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,859
that is like the the crown jewel of

207
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,779
Hydroponics right I mean as far as it's

208
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,960
either it's either I'm Getty in in

209
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,519
Israel or it's alsmere and Holland those

210
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,680
are like the two

211
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,180
critical spots right Al smears where all

212
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,060
the greenhouses are outside of uh

213
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,819
outside of Amsterdam and you know when

214
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,680
you fly in right that's the thing as a

215
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,900
as a grower when you fly into Amsterdam

216
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
is almost like nowadays flying into

217
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,079
Colorado right you come in at night and

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,759
you see all the lights and you're like

219
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,959
that's a grow that's a grow that's a

220
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,180
grow that's a great now you can spot

221
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,339
them out and in Holland right the

222
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,800
airport is right where the greenhouses

223
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,779
are so when you land it's like you're

224
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,460
coming into like there it is you know so

225
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,659
it really gets you going so when I got

226
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,818
there I really wanted to learn

227
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,680
everything I could about Hydroponics I

228
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,900
really was super focused on it I was

229
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,800
into aeroponics at the time I was I

230
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:58,500
became the uh after a while I became the

231
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,780
distributor for General Hydroponics in

232
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,220
the Netherlands which you know now if I

233
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,799
look back I'm like

234
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,000
oh my God I like I literally had the I

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,038
had them by the balls you know what I

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,478
mean so I was like I was really like oh

237
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,818
I have the best food in the world

238
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:15,300
because really General Hydro

239
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,919
definitely changed the game for indoor

240
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,960
Growers on hydroponics because it really

241
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,219
gave you an ability to adjust your

242
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,258
formulas a little bit even if it was

243
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,720
just minor adjustments like

244
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,639
two one one or two two one or you know

245
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,860
if you you just it was quite simple you

246
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,598
had your grow your flower your micro and

247
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,800
you could bounce in back and forth

248
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:33,598
between those

249
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,080
but in Holland it was like you know

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,778
they're growing on acres and acres and

251
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,060
Acres of greenhouse like massive scale

252
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,038
flowers vegetables everything you know

253
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,219
everything under the sun

254
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:50,759
but they're also doing it from a you

255
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,220
know a Dutch pragmatic and I can you

256
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,500
know the economy of scale type situation

257
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,700
so when you start talking Acres of

258
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,159
anything

259
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,278
every penny counts right so so for them

260
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,500
Hydroponics is based on economy and it's

261
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,019
based on ability to push things through

262
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,639
the system fast because they have you

263
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,278
know the largest flower distribution

264
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,958
centers in Holland right and it's like

265
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,278
they the airport had they have their own

266
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,619
area at the airport where they do their

267
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,659
auctions and they bring all the flowers

268
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,639
in and bring it all in ship them all

269
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,458
over the world so you can imagine that's

270
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,740
like a well well oiled machine right

271
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:29,099
it's like they have they can grow a

272
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,899
plant and have it in a store in 48 hours

273
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,879
from the time it gets cut you know what

274
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,480
I mean it's anywhere in the world which

275
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,220
is amazing so so I went there like like

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,440
it was church you know I was just like

277
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,820
oh my God I'm going out to I'd go out to

278
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,740
Ellesmere and I go to these Greenhouse

279
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,360
Supply Centers and walk around and had

280
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,200
no idea what I was looking at I was just

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,360
just overwhelmed you know but I

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,620
um started working for Scentsy seeds I'm

283
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,159
in 93

284
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,839
and so that kind of got me uh got me

285
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,639
more on the smaller like got me more

286
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,899
realistic size systems because the thing

287
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,539
is when I went to Ellesmere I just was

288
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,339
like where to start right you're talking

289
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,679
about these million dollar greenhouses

290
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,959
and it just was way over my head but

291
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,599
when I started working at Scentsy we

292
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,039
started with a very passive hydroponic

293
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,440
system it was like a

294
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,559
it was like probably the most

295
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,680
easy least

296
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,599
sort of active system that I've ever

297
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,299
worked with and it was a I used a

298
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
basically it was like a

299
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:34,019
cement cement mixing container you know

300
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,180
to Classic black ones and it they'd put

301
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,759
a water level meter in the bottom

302
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,559
this is the plastic water level meter uh

303
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,819
put an ion exchanger on the bottom and

304
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,859
that was the key to the whole thing was

305
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,720
this ion exchanger right so it's like

306
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,519
little polymer balls a little red

307
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,200
polymer balls and you sprinkle that down

308
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,879
at the bottom of the container

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,940
and you fill it up with Hydro corals

310
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,740
with your with your hydrostones there

311
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,240
and you know you set your you basically

312
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,000
would put your rock wool blocks on top

313
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,740
and top feed them until the roots made

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,179
it to the bottom of the container so

315
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,980
you'd be top feeding

316
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,979
very lightly you know just kind of

317
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,899
coaxing The Roots down and then once the

318
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,399
roots got to the bottom where the water

319
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,919
would be because you'd fill your water

320
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,000
level maybe you know a couple inches at

321
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,099
the bottom

322
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,659
and that was it and I was like that was

323
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,860
there considered a hydroponic system I

324
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,838
mean that is technically it's

325
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,000
Hydroponics but it's like so inactive

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,100
there was no nothing happening right so

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,240
I was always like sitting there watching

328
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,980
it going like

329
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,480
there's got to be more like I'm so used

330
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,339
to looking at these other systems

331
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,820
they've got injectors and they've got

332
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:38,339
all sorts of stuff so it felt like it

333
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,959
wasn't I wasn't involved enough you know

334
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,820
and so I ended up poking the hole in the

335
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,000
bottom of it right putting them drain in

336
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,860
there screwed everything up right out of

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,240
the gate because I let all the ion

338
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,339
exchanger out

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,379
which I didn't you know I didn't get the

340
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,480
whole system but that whole that just

341
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,200
those little polymers was the key to the

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,879
whole system because they took in extra

343
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,278
you know they took in any kind of uh

344
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,278
extra salts and things and kept it away

345
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:08,039
from the roots and and balanced the pH

346
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,458
where once I got rid of it I was like oh

347
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:15,599
so I quickly learned you know that it's

348
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:19,078
with Hydroponics it's a system and the

349
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,839
system is important but it's also

350
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,639
really based on you right so if you you

351
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,279
know forget to do one thing or

352
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,439
contaminate something and so I I learned

353
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,480
quite quickly that it was a there's a

354
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,160
lot of moving Parts not in that system

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,659
in particular because that's why I was

356
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,879
pissed off I was like I want any more

357
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,740
action so then the next thing I've built

358
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,659
went straight from that

359
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,399
to aerobonics because that's what I

360
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,578
always think in my mind Hydroponics

361
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,679
meant like complicated things with lots

362
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,838
of I needed I needed to make it which I

363
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,399
realized down the road that that was the

364
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,380
exact reason why

365
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,360
I stopped you know but in the beginning

366
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,419
it was I think it's because a lot of

367
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,899
people are you know we're very into the

368
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:03,179
into the tweaking you know like and and

369
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,159
I felt like with with this with my hydro

370
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,778
systems that I was building you know I

371
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,778
was really into the construction of it

372
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,338
so I went out and built my own aeroponic

373
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:13,559
system I looked online I wasn't even

374
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,839
online back there I looked in a book

375
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,159
imagine that a book and I was looking at

376
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,680
the systems and it was like oh those are

377
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,000
PVC pipes with little baskets in them I

378
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,799
can do that you know what I mean so then

379
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,620
I went to the back to The Supply Center

380
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,179
that I'd gone to in elsemere with all

381
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,700
these parts and stuff and I started to

382
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,679
just build them in the in the aisles you

383
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,278
know I'd stand in the aisle and like

384
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,778
okay if I take this sprayer and have to

385
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,759
figure out the gallons per minute and

386
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:41,338
you know try to figure out a calculate

387
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,539
something that would work and kind of

388
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,800
bought this whole all these little bits

389
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,099
and pieces and took them back to my

390
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,719
place and uh we

391
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,579
we built this system

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,920
and

393
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,958
um it was amazing like

394
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,120
we over built it because we had the we

395
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,619
had access to the best of the best when

396
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,600
it came to like

397
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,879
hydroponic equipment right so it was all

398
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,159
like you had to know what it was right

399
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,539
so I was frankensteining everything like

400
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,219
oh I'll take this piece and it connected

401
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,139
to this one so I had no idea what I was

402
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,620
doing but I made a system that worked

403
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:17,399
but I made it too good like it was way

404
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,620
over built classic classic like

405
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,399
you know later on when I realized how

406
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,980
much I in you know I had UV I had UV for

407
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,679
the water I had like I went full full

408
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,360
stop you know the water would be cleaned

409
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,458
by UV it would go back into the system

410
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,500
and the sprayers were

411
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,838
um the ones that would spin you know so

412
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,820
they would make a lot of noise

413
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,560
and I'm in an apartment in Amsterdam

414
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,060
right and in Amsterdam the apartments

415
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,278
are small

416
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,119
you have 16 amps of power

417
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,198
right 16 amps for the entire apartment

418
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,720
including your fridge including whatever

419
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,799
else you got so you start thinking about

420
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,420
how you're gonna

421
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,159
how are you gonna grow in a house with

422
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,919
16 amps you know what I mean it was

423
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,679
always like a real struggle so I built

424
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,000
this system had it all set up turned it

425
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,679
on

426
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,480
and within

427
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,679
five seconds I already knew I made a

428
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
mistake I was like

429
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,778
oh my God I think I over built this

430
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,220
thing right and it started

431
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:16,198
like 30 of those little sprayers were

432
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,300
going off inside these things

433
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,159
and instantly my neighbor just started

434
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:23,759
banging on my ceiling you know or his

435
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,259
ceiling on my floor right I'm like oh

436
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,879
now what I gotta do you know what I mean

437
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,500
so then I realized

438
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,000
this is never gonna work so I told the

439
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,559
guy oh my washing machine was off

440
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,299
balance you know I've made up some story

441
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,219
but then I realized like I can't even

442
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,740
use this system so I had to like

443
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,519
dismantle that thing

444
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,620
go to slabs you know and just go just go

445
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,320
real simple slabs with drippers which

446
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,060
again you know with Hydro you can you

447
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
can take it to whatever level you want

448
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:53,759
as far as complications and sometimes

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,740
it's you know advantageous there's I've

450
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,740
seen systems that are amazing plants

451
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,139
look great but I know in my heart that

452
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,519
when they harvest whoever's cleaning

453
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,778
this thing is going to go nuts you know

454
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,820
I mean because that's the problem with

455
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,899
with

456
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,300
hydroponics in general in my opinion is

457
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,620
that your clean factor is so important

458
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,359
you know you got to really keep

459
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,060
everything just

460
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,278
Uber clean you know what I mean

461
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,799
so yeah that was so that was sort of my

462
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,379
start and then I realized uh

463
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,179
you know I went and I did Coco and

464
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,100
because I felt like Coco was more closer

465
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,679
to to soil you know what I mean it had

466
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,959
more of a Vibe but then Coco has its own

467
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,698
own limitations also you know I feel

468
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,778
like with with

469
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,539
um

470
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,399
like I've seen a lot of like I'd say a

471
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:41,039
big percentage of people grow with cocoa

472
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,220
in the industry and you see and like

473
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,078
within you know else and I never say it

474
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,120
as a dis I'm always like oh is this

475
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,620
grown with cocoa and they're like

476
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,539
how did you know you know what I mean

477
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,240
and it's just like it's because it comes

478
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:56,819
out in a certain band like a certain

479
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,899
there's not it's hard to go above a

480
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,660
certain point

481
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,919
and luckily though the low points are

482
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,019
tend to be better than most you know

483
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,779
what I mean so like the average guy has

484
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,359
a cushion when he does cocoa you know

485
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:12,119
straight Hydro

486
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,099
like deep water culture is also my

487
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,558
favorite when it comes to like mother

488
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,539
plants and big plants and if you want to

489
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,599
grow like I mean I've seen the biggest

490
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,838
plants ever grown have been on dwc ever

491
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,938
like well you know besides outdoor

492
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,119
NorCal or something or you know Oregon

493
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,700
but indoors like strictly indoors I saw

494
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,639
a system one time guy sent me a photo

495
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,940
from Canada from back in the early 90s

496
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,700
and his setup was so simple

497
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,798
it blew my mind because you could tell

498
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,179
that this guy has run this over and over

499
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,859
and over and over and over and over and

500
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,860
over again he knows his parameters right

501
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,959
he would grow he had him on milk cartons

502
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:55,379
right so he had milk cartons stacked up

503
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,259
with a with a dwc bucket on top of each

504
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,820
one so it's raised up off the ground

505
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:03,660
because the plant was perfectly round

506
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,939
right and the bottom of it was you know

507
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,038
stick like so it would say it was let me

508
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,140
see where the cameras so if it was like

509
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,819
up on two or I was up on one milk carton

510
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,038
with a with a five gallon bucket and

511
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,200
then the the lowest buds were coming

512
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,879
right almost down to the ground and the

513
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,500
top ones were hitting almost the ceiling

514
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,380
and these things looked like an

515
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,179
explosion like it was like wow dude

516
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,419
amazing and he sent me these photos in

517
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,179
sync and it was like empty room

518
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:33,360
and then bedroom and then full flower

519
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:35,160
room and between the veg between the

520
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,279
empty room and the full flower room was

521
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,259
like you couldn't even imagine that

522
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,759
those could be sustained by that just

523
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,859
that simple five gallon bucket but it

524
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,179
was because he had a separate Reservoir

525
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:49,139
and another room

526
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:51,660
with like a you know 200 gallon that fed

527
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,460
with um Texas controllers style you know

528
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,320
the old you know Texas controller that

529
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,079
that it's just like the the one main

530
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,460
unit going to the other units so

531
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,899
so you could otherwise you would never

532
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,640
be able to do this because they would

533
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,720
suck up all the water in five minutes

534
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,980
you know what I mean because these

535
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,538
plants are just massive but the funny

536
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,099
part about it was he had all these

537
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,160
photos and then the last photo was like

538
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:14,159
this humongous cop standing next to it

539
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,960
like huge like six foot seven cops

540
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,779
standing next to the plant like with a

541
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,400
big smile like and I was like oh that's

542
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,899
so depressing like you know what I mean

543
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,179
like I saw the first two pictures I was

544
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,419
like wow this guy's doing great oh not

545
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:30,000
so great not so great at the end but uh

546
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,740
it was a classic Canadian setup too

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,519
because what he did is he had he had the

548
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,740
nine dwcs and I think he had 12 lights

549
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,319
total right so he had 12 000 Watts

550
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:45,240
classic you know Canadian style hanging

551
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:47,759
right no hoods so nine hanging uh bulbs

552
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,859
and then or no 12 hanging bulbs with

553
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,419
nine light with nine plants in between

554
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,279
so there was light on every side of

555
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,120
every plant and it was amazing like the

556
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,099
setup was bare bone super simple

557
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,619
massive you know what I mean and I think

558
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,759
dwc is like you know when you see roots

559
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:03,979
coming out of those things sometimes

560
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,720
you're just like

561
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,919
wow like it blows your mind because you

562
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,900
know that that's

563
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,759
if you stretched all those roots out

564
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,559
they would fill the room you know what I

565
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,140
mean because they're just compacted out

566
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,660
so you've done several different

567
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,220
hydroponic systems in the past I think a

568
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,440
lot of folks make the mistake of

569
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,120
thinking that Hydroponics is only dwc

570
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,279
you know what I mean but there's so many

571
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,079
other systems out there I mean one of

572
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,460
the ones that you didn't mention is uh

573
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,279
flood and drain have you done that in

574
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,600
the past I I not for flowering so much I

575
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,918
used to do that with my vegging plants a

576
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,019
lot of times so I had a flood and drain

577
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,759
table I'd put all my blocks on there and

578
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,918
then once the roots were popping through

579
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,660
I dropped them onto the slabs you know

580
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,160
or into the whatever system we were

581
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,620
doing so flood and drain is really good

582
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,580
for for that's for that type of thing

583
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,038
because

584
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,899
they're they're just going for it but I

585
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,119
felt like whenever I was did whenever I

586
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,660
saw people doing flood and drain for

587
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,699
flowering plants you tended to get like

588
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,900
unless they were all monocultured if

589
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,400
they were all the same strain okay then

590
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,200
it would be easier to maintain but if

591
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,780
you had a situation where you had

592
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,460
multiple things going on it's very hard

593
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,440
to like lock them in because you'd over

594
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,400
water one and underwater the other ones

595
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
you know what I mean because they get

596
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,940
into these they just have different

597
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,480
capillary sort of action and so you'd

598
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,279
end up with like like over like they're

599
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,558
fine and veg but in flour I always felt

600
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,019
like you you'd overdo it sometimes

601
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,639
because they they're they're in a

602
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,200
different mode when when you're young

603
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,179
you can just throw whatever you want at

604
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,940
them and they'll take it you know but I

605
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,880
I feel like uh

606
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,298
you know the idea of hydro is is a very

607
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,760
enticing especially to new Growers but

608
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,980
what I tended to tell people was like

609
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,500
you're gonna learn a lot more growing in

610
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,579
soil just because you're not so fixated

611
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,980
on

612
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,759
on fixing the system every time you know

613
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,380
I mean because you come in the room

614
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,339
you're like oh I got a leak over here so

615
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,659
you're not even looking at your plants

616
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,639
anymore you're looking at the leak you

617
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,320
know and you're working on that leak and

618
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,759
then you go to your plants whereas on

619
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,899
soil it's sort of like unless it's a

620
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,980
water situ I mean the only thing you

621
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,720
really have to do you come in you're

622
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,279
like oh my God they're all drooping I

623
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,140
gotta water them before I can do

624
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,960
anything but that's about it otherwise

625
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,059
you're not so you know worried about

626
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,079
little little things and so I think it's

627
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:14,819
a

628
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,918
smarter especially from the beginning

629
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,619
like if you're a new grower

630
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,179
start you're better off to work your way

631
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,279
towards Hydro instead of the other way

632
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,019
around like that's what I did I did the

633
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,700
wrong I did the exact wrong way I went

634
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,579
straight to the most complicated thing

635
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,440
possible and uh

636
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,639
probably been like that all the way

637
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,700
through you know I still do the same

638
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,020
thing try to sabotage myself yeah I was

639
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,319
going to ask you when you're you're

640
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,879
talking to a new grower and they want to

641
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,279
do Hydroponics I mean there are so many

642
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,140
different ways to grow in Hydroponics

643
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,139
right what do you typically recommend

644
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,900
for them to start out in what what style

645
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,659
um if you're really if you're dead set

646
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,340
on doing it I would say

647
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,320
um well actually I would go in more with

648
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,839
Coco just because it kind of keeps them

649
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,819
in that realm so that the transition

650
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,558
when they decide that they do not want

651
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,480
to grow things ready for they won't feel

652
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,678
so like out of their element you know

653
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,779
what I mean because and also uh I feel

654
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,700
like the formulas that people have now

655
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,678
for Coco

656
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,880
because they're they're dialed it in so

657
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,620
much better like in the beginning there

658
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,240
was a lot of issues because of the

659
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,399
enzymes and because you didn't have the

660
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,900
right so if you're if you didn't have a

661
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,640
buffer if the right buffers within your

662
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,679
food you'd have a nightmare you know

663
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
what I mean and that that's where that's

664
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,980
what turned me off of of Coco down the

665
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,960
road was because I felt like I was

666
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,058
pigeonholed into having to to work with

667
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,500
certain I have to do this I can't not do

668
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,079
this if I don't do this they're not

669
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,640
gonna you know they're not gonna Thrive

670
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,038
um whereas you felt like I had much more

671
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,500
range when you were just kind of working

672
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,359
on organic side but but I did I do think

673
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,940
that with um

674
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,939
if for instance like uh

675
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,380
um

676
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,780
a kind of a like a hybrid version of is

677
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,400
sometimes also good too where you have

678
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,019
um you know you're you're giving people

679
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,659
like Earth boxes things like that that

680
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,418
have that awicking system so that you're

681
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,100
you're kind of in the automated feeding

682
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,020
but you're not quite there you know and

683
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,119
I it is definitely

684
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,339
um

685
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,678
uh important that you figure out what's

686
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,240
comfortable for you though because like

687
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,340
nothing worse than putting all your eggs

688
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,798
you know going into it so deep and then

689
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,019
realizing at a certain point like oh man

690
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,220
we've kind of wasted a lot of how many I

691
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,960
mean how many times do you go to your

692
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,120
friend's place and look in there

693
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,159
uh in their garage and see like the

694
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,538
remnants of all the grow systems that

695
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,659
didn't make it you know what I mean it's

696
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:42,058
just like my I have a graveyard of

697
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:44,400
things at my spot right now yeah some of

698
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:46,200
these ways can be easier than others

699
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
like you know talking about beginner

700
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,779
mistakes real quick uh you know I've

701
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,839
seen dwc systems where people try to be

702
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,460
sort of hands off with it and they go

703
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,439
ahead and all of a sudden their EC is is

704
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,058
skyrockets they feed a hot too High VC

705
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,980
and their punts are dead overnight you

706
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:03,658
know what I mean so it's like it can be

707
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,640
a little bit more risky than some of the

708
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,280
other methods of growing in my opinion

709
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,720
in an Organics as let's transition to

710
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,819
that now there's so many different ways

711
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,819
you can do Organics as well right you

712
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:17,158
can make your own soil mix and then feed

713
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:19,259
in Blends organic Blends from there you

714
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,020
can do individual amendments you could

715
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:24,720
buy bagged organic potting mix and then

716
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,819
go from there what's your style of

717
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
organic like how do you approach organic

718
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,639
gardening

719
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,440
uh well I'm lucky enough to live on a

720
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,919
farm so I have the ability to kind of

721
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,600
you know work with what's there and also

722
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,038
um you know if you're if you're growing

723
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,178
and that's the thing is with Hydro it

724
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,798
makes sense sometimes because like yeah

725
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,840
you're living in a place where you can't

726
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,240
bring soil in and out and not look like

727
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,558
complete and nutcase like what are they

728
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,980
doing in this nice house coming into

729
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,538
this you know so there's always reasons

730
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,000
for everything right

731
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:56,099
um and and with me with with Organic

732
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,099
like so I I um

733
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:02,459
uh I right now I'm doing uh three by

734
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,459
three uh

735
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,880
cloth pots as the square ones you know

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,619
um I like to grow with large uh

737
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,778
large containers you know what I mean

738
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:15,359
I'm not interested like that's that's

739
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:17,400
like when I see people growing on soil

740
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,599
but they're doing them in one gallons or

741
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,100
three gallons or something and they're

742
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,298
feeding them like at that point you're

743
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:22,678
Hydro you know what I mean you might as

744
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,960
well grow Hydro at that point because

745
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,120
you are feeding them every single day so

746
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,579
for me it's like about a two two day

747
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,079
with a dry back kind of feeding schedule

748
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,298
is about right you know what I mean like

749
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,918
I try not to like I don't want to have

750
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:36,839
to I don't want to have to go down there

751
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,520
every day but also don't I like to hand

752
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,558
feed everything just because it's like

753
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,480
that way I mean the numbers are not very

754
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,678
you know if it was a large scale grow of

755
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,538
course you're going to automate as much

756
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,080
as you can but when you're dealing with

757
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:50,700
personal sized Gardens I think it's

758
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,319
super important that you do hand water

759
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,819
if possible because it really connects

760
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,798
you to the plant like you can you know

761
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:57,178
you pick up the pot you check the weight

762
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,859
you know what I mean if it's in a pot or

763
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:02,220
if it's in a if it's in a three by three

764
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,658
you know you you know you've given it a

765
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,880
couple days you see a little bit of

766
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,580
droop you come in you feed but I really

767
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,799
feel like hand watering connects you to

768
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:12,298
your Garden a lot like it is really like

769
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,099
important that you pay attention

770
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,359
obviously too you know and I'm always

771
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,918
counting in my head like all I'm doing

772
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,719
is walking around and Counting

773
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,820
everything like counting you know like

774
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,319
okay this one check the weight okay

775
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:24,000
that's you know and they kind of know in

776
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,740
your head that's 30 seconds there you

777
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,179
know that's a minute oh this one and

778
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,480
then so I'm just constantly walking

779
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,919
around and poking and prodding and I

780
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,259
feel like it's one of those things where

781
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,020
you like I really don't like when people

782
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,700
feed like on a schedule whenever they

783
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:39,839
feel like it like it's really the plants

784
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,480
it's up to the plants you know what I

785
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,519
mean so like if I go in and this one

786
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,538
over here has not been feeding very much

787
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,099
well I'm not going to give it anything

788
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,319
I'm going to let it dry out a little bit

789
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,639
because I've seen many people who it

790
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,778
just becomes like a system where they're

791
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
just like doesn't matter you know

792
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:55,500
whatever you didn't eat too bad now

793
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,419
you're getting more you know what I mean

794
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,919
but then you'll see you know you can

795
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,038
track those plants down the road and

796
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,480
you'll see though they will not uh live

797
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,859
up to the to the ones next to them

798
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,778
because they're just you know they need

799
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,939
they need a break for a day or so so

800
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:12,778
yeah I think um

801
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,840
for me like organic equals that

802
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,960
idea of hand watering and you know slow

803
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,459
slow pace not trying to the minute you

804
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,380
want to set it all up and forget about

805
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,880
it that's when you you need to think

806
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,380
about Hydra at that point because that's

807
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,120
that's the kind of person you know if

808
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,700
you want to set it up on your phone and

809
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,798
be all high-tech and you know check all

810
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,140
your stuff that's cool and I appreciate

811
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,099
it and it's but a lot of times for me

812
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,860
it's like

813
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,719
it's a lot like uh

814
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:40,979
I used to work on boats right I used to

815
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,360
sail on boats and a lot of times like

816
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,860
when you were on a small boat you do

817
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,359
everything by hand right everything's by

818
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,038
hand you've got to like go in there and

819
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,439
adjust adjust the trim on the on the

820
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,640
sail run back here so but if you're on a

821
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,019
bigger boat

822
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,720
everything's automated you know what I

823
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,038
mean you just poop you hit a button and

824
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,038
so

825
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,019
for me I like the idea of running around

826
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,000
and doing adjusting things because it

827
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,519
keeps me in the in the moment you know

828
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,880
what I mean it also makes me like know

829
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,900
like I know when I'm going to bed like

830
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
oh

831
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,620
I gotta go back and check that because

832
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,019
it's like you're you're connected to

833
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,298
your garden more the minute you like

834
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,099
have it all on your computer or it's on

835
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,298
your phone or whatever it's like you're

836
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,379
waiting for your phone to tell you if

837
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,700
your plants are not good you know what I

838
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,980
mean it's like you shouldn't you don't

839
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,360
you lost it you lost your little heart

840
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,038
connection to your plants at that point

841
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,759
because you're like ah it'll take care

842
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,619
of it and oh [ __ ] my phone's dead oh no

843
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:38,099
like things you know too late too little

844
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:41,398
too late and uh we've all left the uh

845
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:43,199
Reservoir running and ran up to the

846
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,359
somebody rang on the doorbell and you

847
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,558
forgot and you went and started doing

848
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,798
something else you know what I mean and

849
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,538
then you had that that heart drop moment

850
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,099
where you're like oh my God

851
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:56,158
and I've done it

852
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,418
more than most I'd say but

853
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,679
still makes you feel it makes you laugh

854
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,500
at yourself though sometimes which is

855
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,000
always a good thing yeah exactly right

856
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,819
when you're like I can't believe I just

857
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,759
did that again right when it comes to

858
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:11,398
like the fertilizer uh do you typically

859
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,440
do like the organic Blends do you do

860
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,739
individual amendments do you do compost

861
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,419
or worm castings a little of a kind of a

862
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,278
little guilty of all of the above in the

863
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,620
sense of I usually well re-amend all my

864
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:25,679
soil like because I'm doing a three by

865
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:28,139
threes I will and I'm you know I I've

866
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,720
played around with no-till I like it but

867
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,500
the problem is is that I'm also

868
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,659
um

869
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,579
nervous about

870
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,080
any kind of pathogens or any kind of

871
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,178
problems kind of kicking in and having

872
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,099
to like you know like once you have a

873
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,080
soil that you've dedicated years into it

874
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:45,000
you know what I mean it's it becomes

875
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,278
super critical

876
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,140
um that you can keep it maintain it and

877
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,898
and I also have sponsors from the show

878
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,940
so I got like you know bio 365 soil I've

879
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:56,099
got access to all so I'm like well you

880
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,380
know it in an Ideal World of course I

881
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,500
would you know be living on my farm

882
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,700
reimending my stuff and keeping it all

883
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,798
biodynamic and within the actual

884
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,899
confines of the property you know what I

885
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,220
mean but when you have people dropping

886
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,259
off pallets of soil to you you're like

887
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,360
ah probably gonna use it I mean I'm not

888
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,038
gonna go out and make my own soil when I

889
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,740
have people delivering me beautifully

890
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,379
made uh products so I'm doing a lot of

891
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,859
testing which makes it harder to kind of

892
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:25,260
maintain one system so um so like on for

893
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:28,379
instance uh what I'll usually do is I'll

894
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:31,019
have all fresh soil on my smaller runs

895
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,940
and then eventually I'll take all that

896
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,440
soil and put it outside and then

897
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,940
reammend it and and then bring it back

898
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,320
into it and use it in a different

899
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,940
different part of the garden you know so

900
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,519
every it's a beautiful thing I got

901
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,019
chickens and we got you know we got cows

902
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,398
and chickens and horses and things on

903
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,980
the property so it's like a constant

904
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,418
flow which is a beautiful thing you know

905
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,278
what I mean and that's where I I love

906
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,659
the idea of and that that's why I feel

907
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,099
like if you have a situation like that

908
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,020
then you if you're not growing

909
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:57,418
organically it'll be crazy right if you

910
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,798
literally have the ability to you know

911
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,120
take all your scraps and feed them to

912
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,339
your chickens and

913
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,139
they're happy you're happy everybody's

914
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,898
happy at that point

915
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,020
um and uh I also work with

916
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:11,519
um with cultured biologics who's also I

917
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,278

00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,240

you're uh treating your plants super

940
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:05,519
special every time you you feed them

941
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,500
you're just like man and then like his

942

nitrogen he's got a nitrogen phosphorus

944
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:13,500
um and he's got like some saponins and

945
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,480
and

946
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,398
all those products I can't believe every

947
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,558
time I hit him up with it you know you

948
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,839
get that extra special feeling when you

949
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:25,139
walk back in and everything is praying

950
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,119
like amazing and just yeah the amount of

951
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,700
growth that comes off those his nitrogen

952
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,619
one I dropped one recently and it it

953
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,120
really smells right it doesn't smell bad

954
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,459
it's got a really weird smell it's got

955
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,439
like a smell of like a locker room like

956
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,440
kind of like high school locker room

957
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,620
funk which is you know if you know it

958
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,778
you know it and you can it's like it's a

959
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:48,719
weird but it's like uh yeah it's just

960
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:51,359
this weird weird vibe but it's but oh my

961
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,100
God the plants they just go off so yeah

962
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,259
so I have an ability to work with a lot

963
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,980
of cool products which makes it kind of

964
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:59,158
like

965
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,380
my curse is that I'm always changing my

966
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:04,919
stuff up like my mom goes nuts right my

967
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,360
mom grows with me and she is she'd be

968
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,700
such a better grower without me around

969
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:11,279
because she's so consistent with her

970
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,799
stuff like she's just you know can just

971
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
consistently Nails it I mean she's her

972
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,119
dad was the grandfather with the garden

973
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,279
right so she pretty much just has it in

974
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,838
her in her system and she never like

975
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,179
like every time there's a [ __ ] up it's

976
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,159
because I try to do something like ah

977
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,599
yay and then she'll come in and what are

978
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,800
you doing you know I was like oh I was

979
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,800
just trying this new thing you know and

980
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,339
and so so I my my

981
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,899
probably my guilt my worst thing about

982
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,000
growing from my personal point of view

983
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:40,739
is that I'm always trying new things

984
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,838
which I mean I feel like it's part of

985
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:45,118
the nature of the Beast right like you

986
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,739
always want to improve on things but

987
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,240
Ann is a little bit like fashion if I

988
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,398
look at photos from five years ago I'm

989
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,658
like what was I doing

990
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,699
doing there

991
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,800
why are my plants so dark you know what

992
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,838
I mean I'm way over feeding them here I

993
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,940
can I'm always critiquing all my old

994
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,320
stuff and it's amazing how each time you

995
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,900
do something you feel like it's the best

996
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,519
you've ever done or sometimes hope it is

997
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,320
and

998
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,139
and there's no more room for improvement

999
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,460
but then lo and behold you look back a

1000
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,719
year later and you're like oh there was

1001
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,338
so much room for improvement it's very

1002
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,559
similar to the whole concentrate game

1003
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:18,659
and all the different things you see the

1004
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,279
evolution of things and how quickly they

1005
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,679
they go up and you're like if you look

1006
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,780
at a photo again from like 10 years ago

1007
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,480
you're just like what is that like

1008
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,099
couldn't even identify it so yeah I

1009
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,920
think it's uh

1010
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:35,460
it's uh it's it's nice to to try

1011
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,019
different stuff but at the same time

1012
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,400
you know if you can lock in on something

1013
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:41,039
that works for you

1014
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,380
good good good uh rule is to continue

1015
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,059
that same thing you know because you

1016
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,559
will improve on it

1017
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,838
or just be like me and always try

1018
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,219
something different I'm just like you

1019
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,619
where I'm always doing something

1020
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,299
different I mean uh some of my viewers

1021
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,800
have complained because they watch my

1022
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,720
videos they're like hey you're not still

1023
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,740
doing that method why what happened is

1024
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,358
there something wrong with it it's like

1025
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,679
no I'm just trying something new there's

1026
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,719
so many different ways to go about it

1027
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,179
when it comes to Organics I was growing

1028
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,559
uh I was using the Earth dust nutrients

1029
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:10,500
by the green Sunshine Company they went

1030
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,139
out of business craft blend by build the

1031
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,139
soil now I'm using a kiss nutrients pack

1032
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,659
kiss Organics nutrient pack but man

1033
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,159
you're making me want to try uh Tim's oh

1034
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:21,659
Tim's is amazing and you know who else

1035
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,159
is also amazing I'm sure you've had them

1036
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:25,379
on the show before his uh dragonfly

1037
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,578
Earth medicine I haven't had him on yet

1038
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,740
I don't need to have them on yeah

1039
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,720
they're amazing they're up in Canada and

1040
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:32,819
they have a complete biodynamic formula

1041
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,739
Duke uses a lot of their stuff and I'm

1042
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,059
just there they're one of the ones in

1043
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,439
the group like I'd say out of all the

1044
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,078
people that are in the industry they're

1045
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,260
like 100 doing it the right way you know

1046
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,599
like there's no no no uh

1047
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,040
they do not skimp on anything like not a

1048
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,900
single input that's in any of their

1049
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,400
products it's not or not 100 certified

1050
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,619
organic like they

1051
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,619
there's no like oh well we're not 100

1052
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,599
sure no if like even if like product

1053
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,039
that went into the compost possibly

1054
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,059
wasn't organic they don't need they

1055
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,338
don't they don't touch it you know what

1056
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,900
I mean so it's amazing there there's

1057
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:07,739
some you know that's the thing with with

1058
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,960
I think uh people tend to

1059
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,279
always think that it's like one extreme

1060
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,139
or the other and that's why I really

1061
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,000
feel like a kind of a combination of

1062
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,319
everything is it what kind of works for

1063
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,179
everybody and if you notice like

1064
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,400
companies like veganics right back in

1065
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,679
the day you know everybody thought if

1066
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,180
you look at it go look into that label

1067
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,399
and look into it

1068
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,960
it's not because it's not vegan there's

1069
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
not there is there is

1070
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,679
two percent maybe three percent

1071
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,480
non-organics you know what I mean but

1072
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,618
that's all it takes right so if you want

1073
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,719
to be extreme you have to be like

1074
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,740
dragonfly Earth medicine and do it real

1075
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,500
right

1076
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:43,019
can't really bottle Organics and and

1077
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,838
truly have a proper product because it's

1078
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:47,460
like that that two percent is probably

1079
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,960
the most important two percent I mean

1080
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,780
it's like it's what's really making it

1081
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,760
do its thing so you know organic has its

1082
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,599
place but it has to be very you know you

1083
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,460
have to

1084
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,260
you also have to be a little bit like

1085
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,119
forgiving on some things too because I

1086
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,740
feel like you want to give the plant the

1087
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,599
best things it can get you know and not

1088
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,098
limit itself

1089
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,539
but yeah you definitely should try it

1090
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,119
you definitely need to trade the culture

1091
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:11,279
it's amazing now are you also doing some

1092
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,740
of the I like to call optional methods

1093
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,480
which is like cover crops mulch layers

1094
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,159
things that aren't really required when

1095
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,179
growing organically but people do it as

1096
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,279
well in order to try to get a better

1097
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,559
result there's benefits to doing those

1098
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,839
things um I do like um cover crops

1099
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,338
mostly because I feel like it helps the

1100
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,460
soil

1101
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:31,139
um not dry out too quickly you know I

1102
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,820
mean otherwise you get that Dusty top

1103
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:34,559
Zone where you just feel like there's

1104
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,000
not much life in the top two inches you

1105
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,078
know and that's really where you want

1106
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,940
more biodiver more biodiversity so like

1107
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,099
um you know I'll I'll tend to grow

1108
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,900
clover and barley and things like that

1109
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:48,359
and sometimes in between like a lot of

1110
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,019
times if I'm not like if there's any

1111
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:50,699
um

1112
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,139
like when I'm finished with the crop

1113
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,059
I'll just throw a bunch of seeds in

1114
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,739
there just to keep the life rolling in

1115
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,838
that thing so it doesn't get all dead on

1116
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,419
you know so but I won't do it as like as

1117
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,099
like that is my only nutrients or the

1118
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,139
the you know go in there and cut all the

1119
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,940
things down and let it go back in and

1120
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,639
that's it like I'm still

1121
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,858
I'm still you know

1122
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,779
coming from the world of just I want to

1123
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:14,940
see some action you know I want to see

1124
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,280
some accident go down now when we're

1125
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,139
talking about Hydroponics versus growing

1126
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
Organics there's a couple things that

1127
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,920
are kind of controversy which will be

1128
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,900
yield and then flavor let's start with

1129
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,579
yield did you personally notice a

1130
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,039
difference in yield when growing

1131
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:32,519
organically versus hydroponically 100

1132
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:36,420
100 yeah like I mean

1133
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:38,820
yeah yeah for sure like uh the thing

1134
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,400
about growing on hydro is you you do you

1135
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,920
do achieve sometimes amazing results

1136
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,900
when it comes to yield right because you

1137
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,400
are

1138
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,358
basically you know

1139
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,338
um

1140
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,380
fog wiring these things right you're

1141
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:54,299
Force feeding them you're giving them

1142
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,460
whatever you know you're maxing them out

1143
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,079
on their EC you're pushing the plants to

1144
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,599
its limit

1145
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,920
um you know I've seen massive plants

1146
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,200
especially recently too because like I

1147
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,720
go and Tour all these Gardens and you

1148
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,699
know it's it's it's beautiful to see but

1149
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,199
I also know that there's pgrs in there

1150
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:11,699
and I'm not really interested in smoking

1151
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,879
any of it because I don't feel it's

1152
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:16,559
healthy but I see some phenomenal growth

1153
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,300
you know what I mean like it's some

1154
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,960
amazing results

1155
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,359
um so yields tend to

1156
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,920
uh suffer a little bit in inorganic not

1157
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,179
not all the time now there are certain

1158
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,579
situations it really depends on your

1159
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:32,219
location and your in whatever your

1160
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,900
inputs are because organic growing for

1161
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:35,699
instance Outdoors

1162
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,740
yeah there's I wouldn't even compare it

1163
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,419
you know what I mean because you're

1164
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,239
never going to get a salty plant to grow

1165
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,579
as big as an organic plant outdoors in a

1166
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,139
large scale just because it it won't it

1167
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,280
will not there's nothing to sustain it

1168
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:48,838
at that point whereas you know when

1169
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,280
you're growing organically Outdoors on a

1170
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:52,500
scale like that

1171
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,200
just the amount of assistance that's

1172
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,179
going on within the mycorrhagial and you

1173
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,578
know the rhizospheres is a completely

1174
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:02,279
active Place whereas if you go on the

1175
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,480
hydro the rhizosphere is a devoid of

1176
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,619
action you know what I mean it's like

1177
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,199
there's things going there's Roots

1178
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,800
growing but there's hardly any you know

1179
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,239
uh life down there and so for me the the

1180
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,740
key to the whole thing is is everything

1181
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,639
helps each other right so if you're

1182
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:19,679
growing uh so like but flip but then on

1183
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,500
the opposite end of the spectrum when it

1184
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,858
comes to flavor hands down 100 organic

1185
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,260
Ivy time like there's no not even a

1186
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:30,659
question like and people can say oh yeah

1187
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,099
I get I can grow it so you know people

1188
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,259
can't tell the difference

1189
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,780
sure sure you can but I bet if somebody

1190
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,920
else grew it organically it would taste

1191
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,720
better than what you know I mean it's

1192
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,260
just like it really comes down to like

1193
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,759
you cannot compare them because you know

1194
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,760
the cardboard chirps you get off of

1195
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,680
Athena is not gonna ever compare it to a

1196
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,079
you know a properly grown organic garden

1197
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,940
just it ain't happening I'm sorry you

1198
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,320
know and and people can

1199
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,720
because a lot of times people will be

1200
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,680
like no but not from experience only

1201
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:00,899
from

1202
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,118
you know they smoked that they think it

1203
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,559
tastes good but they don't know what

1204
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,760
else could be there you know what I mean

1205
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,338
there's so much more that can be there

1206
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,260
and yeah definitely from a

1207
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:11,880
from an actual wanting to smoke a point

1208
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,619
of view like I had um we did think of

1209
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,539
the adsi which is the out of denture

1210
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,640
Invitational we did him

1211
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:21,179
I think

1212
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:24,059
2014-15 and 18. and every single time

1213
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:26,039
top three organic and this is all blind

1214
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,420
and this is by The Growers like you know

1215
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,820
we did the classic where if you enter

1216
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,159
you get to test so it wasn't like

1217
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:34,619
you know randos it was like

1218
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,980
you entered or you entered Hydro but you

1219
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,420
picked organic so therefore that just

1220
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,099
tells me it wins right there you know

1221
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,619
what I mean like The Growers themselves

1222
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,359
see it and appreciate it

1223
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,460
so yeah I think you can't really beat it

1224
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,259
now what about Bud's structure I heard

1225
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,000
people some people say blood structure

1226
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,060
is compromised when you're growing with

1227
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,880
Hydroponics for example they they uh

1228
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,219
have grown the same cultivar same cut

1229
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,900
and organic versus Hydroponic and

1230
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:03,000
they've got more denser bud structure

1231
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,760
and the organic side of things but

1232
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,559
Hydroponics it's more airier fluffier

1233
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,140
bud structure what are your thoughts on

1234
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,759
that oh yeah I think that's true too I

1235
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,139
mean it comes down to genetics a little

1236
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,460
bit there though also so sometimes

1237
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,460
you'll have certain ones that just

1238
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,659
respond better to the situation

1239
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,099
um you know the thing about Hydro is

1240
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:21,858
it's a lot of water weight right so

1241
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:25,440
you've got this like

1242
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:28,559
massive you know expansion and large

1243
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,240
watery cells you know it's very similar

1244
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,460
to like and then if you take organic

1245
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,739
growing it's like the cell's structure

1246
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:37,318
is tighter you know they sell walls are

1247
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:40,318
thicker so when you take a cell wall

1248
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:42,119
That's thicker and you dry it out and

1249
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,759
you have more mass right so

1250
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,680
theoretically and then and it's denser

1251
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,839
so you don't get this big expansion and

1252
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,838
then retraction right that's that

1253
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:53,460
like big bud right when I was so uh in

1254
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,400
Holland right

1255
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,079
because the Dutch are very um

1256
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,240
they're very money orientated they're

1257
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,039
not so you know flower orientated they

1258
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,379
love their money it doesn't matter what

1259
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,838
it is if it's flowers for the kukenhof

1260
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,519
or if it's you know whatever it is it's

1261
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,679
about the bottom line that's all the

1262
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,259
Dutch really care about that's where

1263
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,078
that's why Americans who go there really

1264
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,920
shine when it came to breeding because

1265
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,839
we really

1266
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,099
we're about flavors and about all these

1267
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,420
things that they weren't about they were

1268
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:26,039
only about size smell and money that's

1269
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,480
kind of that's their that's their goal

1270
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,338
right how big is it what does it smell

1271
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,559
like how much money can I get you know

1272
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:35,400
and so we were more like you know how

1273
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:37,078
does it smell how does it taste and does

1274
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,980
the joint even burn you know what I mean

1275
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,260
because that would be the other thing

1276
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,818
too you get people just pack them up

1277
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,140
with food and don't really flush it

1278
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:45,599
properly and you end up with some

1279
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,318
terribly burning and so

1280
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,838
um

1281
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,119
the but what I also noticed too and you

1282
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,858
you as you go higher up in altitude you

1283
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,660
know your plants change too and that's

1284
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:58,318
one of the things where I almost compare

1285
00:44:54,659 --> 00:45:00,539
like a high altitude plant to a organic

1286
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,400
growing plant and a valley like a low

1287
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:05,460
valley plant to a hydro plant because

1288
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,338
the low valley plant gets a lot of water

1289
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,039
right grows really tall and thin and

1290
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:13,139
kind of just massive biomassy kind of

1291
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,159
situation and as you go up into the

1292
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:17,039
mountains

1293
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:20,879
same genetics would be short

1294
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,818
and more compact to insulate them better

1295
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,160
and also to be more efficient and as the

1296
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:28,980
UV increases as you go higher up and the

1297
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,318
UV increases it it shortens everything

1298
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,059
down like so if you go to the top of a

1299
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,858
mountain and see the trees at the top

1300
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,900
they're a lot shorter and Tighter and

1301
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:38,578
more Compact and as you go down the

1302
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,780
mountain it gets bigger and bigger and

1303
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,760
when you get to the bottom they're

1304
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,260
really big and just water so it's kind

1305
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,040
of like similar in the sense that you

1306
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,920
get this density issue and that density

1307
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,059
is what I believe is the part that

1308
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,260
you're saying as far as like because

1309
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:54,239
I've seen a lot of plants growing in

1310
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,619
Hydra which you know they look they fill

1311
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,358
up the area

1312
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,800
but you can just see that there's not

1313
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,179
much there you know what I mean like

1314
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,099
they have this especially all the Cali

1315
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:04,259
strains all these new Cali strains are

1316
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,940
really lame I'm sorry to say they're

1317
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,940
really lame to grow you grow them and

1318
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,460
you're like what that's it like they

1319
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,720
don't ever explode you know they don't

1320
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,220
have that Vigor that you're looking for

1321
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,838
and I feel like

1322
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:17,459
it's almost like all of us old-time

1323
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,519
Growers we're always going back to the

1324
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,818
90s right oh in the 90s big giant

1325
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:25,679
Williams Wonder but you know we had like

1326
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:26,818
because everything counted right like it

1327
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,919
was like

1328
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:30,719
you get one shot you know you get one

1329
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,119
shot kid and then you gotta get it and

1330
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,578
make it happen whereas now the

1331
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,318
pressure's off as far as like you know

1332
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,200
you're running a licensed facility

1333
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:43,380
there's no there's no pressure Beyond

1334
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:45,239
doing a good job but what's funny is

1335
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,579
that because of that people gotten a lot

1336
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,338
less focused on

1337
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,200
you know like the all of the above

1338
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,900
strains that you want which is like good

1339
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,639
yields are good strength and power and

1340
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,858
does all the things you want they just

1341
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,358
go in for like the one all they're going

1342
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,980
for is extraction that's pretty much

1343
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,440
like that's how people's brains are so

1344
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,539
like whatever they they take it does it

1345
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,940
wash well right when somebody asks me is

1346
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:11,639
does it wash well I'm usually like

1347
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,318
off you know what I mean like really

1348
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:14,699
that's all you care about is washing the

1349
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:17,460
plane you don't even care about the

1350
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,679
plant because the plants that wash well

1351
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,199
are not the plants that smoke well

1352
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,419
the plants that smoke well tend to be

1353
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:26,039
you know individual nice buds that are

1354
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,720
really like get a chance to mature

1355
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:29,579
properly and they're not all these like

1356
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,739
runny little plants and but the ones

1357
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:33,180
that are runny are the ones that are

1358
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,759
loose they're really good for making

1359
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:37,318
extracts you know so you know like you

1360
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,420
don't want to like like your really good

1361
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:42,779
flour plant that's got nice compact

1362
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,818
beautiful buds they're hard to get into

1363
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,319
to make the product so by the time you

1364
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:48,659
get into them you've tore them all up

1365
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,759
and now you've created more you know

1366
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,799
just more chlorophyll in the system or

1367
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,800
more plant matter

1368
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,599
whereas if you get plants that are

1369
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,119
you know like

1370
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,220
just easy there are lots of lots of

1371
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,140
trikes on both sides and it's easy to

1372
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:05,939
get to knock it all off really quickly

1373
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,858
you're hand paddling you know

1374
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,539
everybody's doing it by hand so they

1375
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:11,219
don't want stuff that you have to break

1376
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:13,858
it up you know and if you have to break

1377
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:16,318
it up you're causing more

1378
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:18,539
you know quality control issues at that

1379
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,219
point so yeah I think I think definitely

1380
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:21,900
uh

1381
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,519
and also the other thing too the the

1382
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,338
number one thing I see problems with is

1383
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,960
pH on hydro systems right I'll walk in

1384
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:29,099
and I'll be like I got a pH problem and

1385
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,139
be like oh what are you talking about no

1386
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,220
you know dude you got a pH problem

1387
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,440
telling you right now look at everything

1388
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:36,358
it's all single leaves it's all like

1389
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,440
looking really stressed out you know

1390
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,940
what I mean and that's the problem with

1391
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,800
Hydra is that

1392
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,800
you know you creating all of the

1393
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,720
boundaries and

1394
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,280
therefore there's a huge chance of

1395
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:49,679
messing all up you know what I mean

1396
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,019
because you are a human and you are not

1397
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,059
like the plants have no problems

1398
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:56,338
um if you give them everything they need

1399
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:57,779
they'll figure it out right and they'll

1400
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:59,400
take it in as they need to take it in

1401
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,900
but when you're doing Hydro you don't

1402
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,960
give them a chance because they only

1403
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,358
have a very limited window to feed which

1404
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,099
is like when the timer kicks on right so

1405
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,480
the timer kicks on they're feeding they

1406
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,640
get a little bit of remnants at the end

1407
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,880
of it all and then it's just drying out

1408
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,618
and you know hopefully expanding Roots

1409
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,079
Etc but

1410
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,640
um when it's on soil or it's on you know

1411
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,900
organically it's like

1412
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:27,299
it's kind of like a they have a

1413
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,800
they have a smorgasbord set up in front

1414
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,839
of them you know and so they're like oh

1415
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,818
well I want one of those when you have

1416
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:36,838
some of that you know and at the same

1417
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:38,940
time the mycorrhizal and other things

1418
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:40,858
are you know getting it ready for the

1419
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,960
plants and setting it all up and then

1420
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,480
they come in and scoop up that you know

1421
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,460
what I mean so there's a lot more

1422
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,699
there's a lot more going on that we

1423
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,940
don't get and you'll never get because

1424
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:55,919
it's you know at a microbial level and

1425
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,900
it's not like it's not your decision to

1426
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,519
make you know it's so yeah I think the

1427
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,700
most of the mistakes would probably be

1428
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,139
human error you know on hydro

1429
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:10,139
which is

1430
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:12,059
you know something we can avoid but with

1431
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,460
with Organic you're kind of like

1432
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:16,139
you just kind of try to create the the

1433
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,179
environment for them to do their thing

1434
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:20,879
that makes sense I definitely want to

1435
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,679
get into cost perspective here but there

1436
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,660
are folks that are on the budget right

1437
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,279
they don't want to be spending uh

1438
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:27,899
hundreds or potentially even thousands

1439
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,599
of dollars depending on how big they set

1440
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,639
up they want to have to get started so

1441
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,700
from a cost perspective talk to us about

1442
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,239
Hydro versus organic so by far obviously

1443
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,439
organic would be cheaper to get into

1444
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,799
now when you start talking about cost

1445
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,300
per pound and on Industrial levels and

1446
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,560
things like that

1447
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,539
um

1448
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,858
after the initial input because the

1449
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:51,900
thing about Hydro is you got to buy the

1450
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:53,519
system right so you buy the system and

1451
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,900
then a lot of people they're like yeah

1452
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,400
but I bought it once and I can just

1453
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,260
reuse it over and over and over again so

1454
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,119
that in their mind is their cost saving

1455
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,400
Factor right there's still inputs right

1456
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,500
you still got your cocoa or your rock

1457
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,300
wool or whatever medium that unless

1458
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,219
you're growing on so like dwc would

1459
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,800
probably be the cheapest format of going

1460
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:13,139
into it because you really only have to

1461
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,880
buy that cocoa block each time or that

1462
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:17,039
Rockwell block each time to put on top

1463
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,800
for the most part

1464
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,480
um whereas you know with and and so

1465
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,079
really it comes down to like

1466
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,940
uh from a beginner point of view

1467
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,400
costs are kind of negligible because

1468
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,838
we're not talking about a big system so

1469
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,400
it might cost a little bit more for

1470
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,799
hydro

1471
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,539
um but the

1472
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,700
the at the end of the day like if they

1473
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:42,119
were to take their cost per gram or

1474
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:44,279
whatever it would end up uh

1475
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:46,019
being cheaper on organic in the long run

1476
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,720
but in the short run

1477
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:51,838
because uh you can sort of like say hey

1478
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,759
I spent 27 dollars and I may and I got a

1479
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,578
pound you know okay so there you go

1480
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,520
that's a pretty good ratio whereas a lot

1481
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:02,220
of times with organic stuff uh

1482
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,599
you know the the the initial costs

1483
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,219
depending on what you're doing I mean if

1484
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,920
you go to build a soil there's another

1485
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:10,139
sponsor of my show and he's got every

1486
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,059
range possible Right you could go you

1487
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:14,460
can spend you can also spend quite a lot

1488
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:16,980
of money on on organic stuff too it is

1489
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,679
so it really depends on on what you want

1490
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,119
to do but you can also go like are those

1491
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,799
guys at dragonfly arithms and they

1492
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,480
quoted me at five dollars a pound for

1493
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,619
their organic that's what their their

1494
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,679
costs are

1495
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,119
you know so five bucks a pound is pretty

1496
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,098
damn cheap I don't think you're gonna

1497
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,500
get much cheaper than that and that's

1498
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,660
because of course they're on you know

1499
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,760
they're using everything within their

1500
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:40,440
farm so they're very rarely putting much

1501
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,059
more inputs in it took them a long time

1502
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,400
to get there and I'm sure there was you

1503
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:47,579
know initial costs all the way along but

1504
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,139
you know you you definitely can grow

1505
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:50,640
cheaper

1506
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:52,199
if you live in the right place

1507
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,279
organically like if you don't live in

1508
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:55,199
the right place it's not going to make

1509
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,339
much sense but you know you're going to

1510
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,939
grow especially if you're doing anything

1511
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:00,900
Greenhouse or outdoor anything large

1512
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,280
because I you know when you start

1513
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,838
thinking about

1514
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,059
I mean I've seen people do it like

1515
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,318
Hydroponics Outdoors are like what is

1516
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,000
wrong you're like what are you doing

1517
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,579
over here you know I mean really going

1518
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,760
against the grain as hard as you can

1519
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:17,220
um but in a small scale I think

1520
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,319
cost effective wise

1521
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:23,219
organic

1522
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:25,739
100 cheaper uh

1523
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:28,739
but at the same time when you're growing

1524
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,779
on scale to like for large licensed

1525
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:34,858
producers and stuff they're going to

1526
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:36,240
look at it like the uh they're going to

1527
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:37,980
have a better time with Hydroponics

1528
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,078
because it's easier for them to

1529
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:43,079
calculate the inputs the outputs because

1530
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,240
there's a very simple formula that keeps

1531
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,318
repeating itself over and over again you

1532
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:48,179
know

1533
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,039
it's kind of my my way of looking at it

1534
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:51,539
got it yeah it can be super cheap

1535
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:53,759
organic they have a closed loop

1536
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:55,920
operation right which is kombucha

1537
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,720
explaining that that farm has which is

1538
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,099
basically they're using their own inputs

1539
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:01,078
that they're creating I mean you can

1540
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,880
even go down the natural farming route

1541
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,280
right with the the fermented plant juice

1542
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,140
fermented fruit juice all that stuff and

1543
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,579
it gets really really cheap then and I

1544
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:10,139
think that's actually

1545
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,500
it's one of the

1546
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:14,940
the latest advancements in in

1547
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,099
agriculture that is even though it's

1548
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,679
ancient Technologies the fact that

1549
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,059
everybody's tuned in on it now and it

1550
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:22,799
was like maybe like

1551
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:24,240
four years ago or something like that I

1552
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,460
think it's the first time I even like

1553
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,899
ran across ferments you know what I mean

1554
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,460
and my friend had him in his garden and

1555
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,019
I was like what's this he's like oh I

1556
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,119
made that out of peaches and I made this

1557
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:35,699
one out of uh mangoes and I was like

1558
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,640
really oh wow and

1559
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:40,618
I you know didn't really

1560
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,940
like I mean his Gardens were nice but it

1561
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,220
wasn't like I wasn't like oh my God

1562
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,079
blown away but then later

1563
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:47,939
flavor wise I started to like you know

1564
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,460
he gave me some from that that round and

1565
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,960
I was just like man this stuff's amazing

1566
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,358
taste right and then so I started to

1567
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,338
gravitate towards it and then now of

1568
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:58,980
course miles is making some awesome

1569
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:00,239
ferments and uh you know teaching

1570
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,500
everybody how to do which is really

1571
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,019
important too I think that's the one

1572
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,300
thing if because we have access to all

1573
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,619
these like fresh new material right yeah

1574
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,539
it's like

1575
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,400
turn it into ferments it makes so much

1576
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,440
sense and so when you can make ferments

1577
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,960
from your own plants and then

1578
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,099
reintroduce it into your own garden it's

1579
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,659
like you know it's the difference

1580
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:24,180
between working with uh you know

1581
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:25,679
local compared to like importing in

1582
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:26,578
every time because when you import stuff

1583
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,379
in

1584
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,079
everything has to establish itself but

1585
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,119
when you have local uh you know you have

1586
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,619
local inputs it's just gives you that

1587
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,700
much of a head start and everything's

1588
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,318
like you know that everything can

1589
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:39,899
survive because that's where it comes

1590
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,818
from you know so yeah it's huge I have

1591
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,900
yet to try some of these natural farming

1592
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:44,519
techniques you know the fermented

1593
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,380
Planters run into fruit juice but you

1594
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,539
know it really is my goal to like not

1595
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,220
spend any money on organic fertilizer

1596
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:51,838
you know what I mean if I could send no

1597
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:53,759
money on fertilizer in the future that's

1598
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,318
that would be a huge win so I'm not

1599
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,119
there yet but maybe I'll get there in

1600
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:59,099
the future I think also like you know

1601
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,500
worms having their own little worm bin

1602
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:03,480
going is always a good move

1603
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,039
um just don't let them dry out that's my

1604
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,079
problem out here it's so dry and I think

1605
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,300
oh you come back you're all sad you just

1606
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,519
lost hundreds of more I'm saying

1607
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,539
come back but yeah worms are great if

1608
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,579
you can get them in your garden that's

1609
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,558
that's a huge bonus right there yeah I

1610
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,180
get the worm bin going and yeah so I'm

1611
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,619
working I'm getting there I'm getting

1612
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:21,719
there but I feel like at the end of the

1613
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:24,480
day you know when it talks about Hydro

1614
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:26,219
versus organic I have some people ask me

1615
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,139
what's better and the follow-up question

1616
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,939
shows me what's better for what you know

1617
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:32,039
what are you looking for are you looking

1618
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,019
to make things easy are you looking to

1619
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:35,639
grow plants fast I had to go on one team

1620
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:38,880
or the other I would go team organic

1621
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,500
just because of my feelings of of a

1622
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,539
consumer you know like if it was if it

1623
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,099
was a producing situation and that's all

1624
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:46,139
you cared about was numbers and

1625
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,338
production I can I can understand when

1626
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,078
people might want to go down that road

1627
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:51,779
but if you're if you're doing it for

1628
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:54,059
yourself and you are the recipient of

1629
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,780
all of this material you're doing

1630
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:00,119
yourself no favors by by limiting your

1631
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,220
organic and like being and going with it

1632
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,960
with a hydro system because you really

1633
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,759
at the end of the day like when it comes

1634
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,039
to food or anything that I'm putting in

1635
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,720
my body I really want to focus on you

1636
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:12,539
know having an organic I'd rather the

1637
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,639
extra money to have organic then then

1638
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,039
try to cut corners and I feel like with

1639
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,598
with anything that you're consuming on a

1640
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,219
daily you should think that way because

1641
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,200
there will be

1642
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,598
a reckoning at some point right and when

1643
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,939
you figure out down the road like wow

1644
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,980
been smoking all this pgr

1645
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,720
might look really good but it's not good

1646
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,099
for you I'm telling you it's 100 not

1647
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,118
good for you you know and you can really

1648
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,280
see the difference so we were saying

1649
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,559
earlier about the you know natural like

1650
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,760
or organic compared to

1651
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:43,559
um uh Hydro really it's the pgrs that's

1652
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,059
the number one issue right now and

1653
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,760
that's the problem with most of the or

1654
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:49,619
get most of the hydro formulas unless

1655
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,180
they specifically tell you that they're

1656
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:53,099
not in there they probably are in there

1657
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,980
you know I mean it's almost like

1658
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,900
it's almost like if you uh if you want

1659
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,780
to get corn products right if it doesn't

1660
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:02,039
say it's organic you can guarantee it's

1661
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,660
GMO

1662
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,858
and it's been grown in the Roundup you

1663
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,779
know what I mean so you probably don't

1664
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:08,400
want to consume it at that point so I

1665
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,819
always feel like with anything like that

1666
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:15,059
you really you're better off to uh

1667
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:17,400
take the slow Road and and have a a

1668
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:19,740
quality product at the end that you can

1669
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,260
feel the safe well said well we could

1670
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:24,419
get deeper and deeper into both aspects

1671
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:26,099
but uh we're gonna wrap things up here

1672
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,358
you know what you know what I'm going to

1673
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:29,900
