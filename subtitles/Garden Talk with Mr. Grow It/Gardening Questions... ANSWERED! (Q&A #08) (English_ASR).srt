1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,519
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,518
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,160
and i'm back with another q a video this

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
q a video i actually did live on twitch

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,519
twitch is a live streaming platform

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
that's mostly known for gaming but they

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,000
also do irl and just chatting live

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
streams i made an announcement on my

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
instagram and on twitter to head on over

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,399
there and ask questions and i got a ton

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
of good questions that i'm answering in

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,159
this video if you want to join me in the

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,519
next q a video and ask questions that

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,799
could potentially be featured in a

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,399
future video check me out at twitch.tv

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,399
mr growit once you hit the follow button

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
it should turn on notifications and then

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
you'll be notified when i go live next

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,679
before we get into the episode i just

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,000
want to give a quick shout out to our

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,920
sponsor for this episode thanks to mars

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
hydro for sponsoring this video mars

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
hydro has two new led grille lights the

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,439
fc8000 and the fce8000

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,039
both grow lights are 800 watts and will

26
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,759
work great in a 4x4 or 5x5 grow space

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,960
the fc 8000 has two versions one with

28
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,478
samsung lm 301b diodes and one with

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,919
samsung lm 301h diodes also the bars are

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,920
detachable the fc e8000 has bridge lux

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
diodes and there are more diodes for a

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,759
longer lifespan link to the website is

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
in the description section below and you

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,599
can use coupon code mr growit for a

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
discount on their products

36
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,478
noob question i just started seeing my

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
plant flower how much longer in your

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,438
opinion well it depends on genetics

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,839
right so

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,279
you could have a strain that does eight

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,118
weeks in flowering you could have one

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,599
that does nine weeks in flowering there

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,400
are some cultivars that go up to i think

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,158
13

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
weeks in flowering i believe is the

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
longest or you can get an autoflowering

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,039
strain which is going to be a little bit

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
less than that right you could

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
potentially get a seven weaker that's an

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,359
autoflower

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,359
so it really all depends on what your

52
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,680
genetics is you can look at seed finder

53
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,959
search seed finder in

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,159
google once you go on there enter in the

55
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
cultivar that you're working with the

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
california strain that you have you

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
should be able to find the breeder

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,038
and those genetics

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
and then also be able to see how long

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,159
it's in flowering for whether it's an

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,039
eight week nine week ten week flowering

62
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,919
strain or or what will we see some

63
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,120
videos like your old videos well i mean

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,719
kinda i

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,719
i mean my old videos are pretty cringy

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,400
if you ask me they uh i've come a long

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,239
way since then

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,159
i have released a video on my main

69
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
channel quite recently i mean this year

70
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,280
i've only released four videos on that

71
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
channel but

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
all of them i believe all of them have

73
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,878
been grow updates yeah all four videos

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,280
have been

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,399
like updates in my garden starting up

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,598
with just more topic based videos um to

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
be completely honest with you it's

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,000
really

79
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,518
really time consuming to make videos me

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,199
in particular the old videos that you

81
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
that you're referring to

82
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,719
i would write a script for the video i

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
would film a footage right write a

84
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,598
script uh record the audio for the

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,400
script cut down the audio

86
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,280
overlay the videos add in effects it's

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,599
like a very time consuming process to do

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,199
those types of videos and to be honest

89
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,959
i'm kind of over it you know and i mean

90
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,799
i'm kind of uh

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,759
kind of moving on that i need to take a

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,519
a

93
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,679
page out of pigeons book

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,000
and just be more simplified with the

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
videos i'm trying to get back into the

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,318
groove of one video per week on my main

97
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,639
channel so stick around for that most of

98
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,158
my time has been occupied by

99
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,158
podcasting

100
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,280
i mean i have my garden talk with mr

101
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,878
growit podcast from the stash podcast so

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
those have just been taking up a lot of

103
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,158
my time and also now i'm back in school

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
so

105
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,798
talk a little bit about the breeders you

106
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,079
prefer or trust for new growers breeders

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
i trust so number one square one

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
genetics i mean this is just off top my

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
head

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,158
square one genetics i trust i trust

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
prism labs i trust subcool seeds sub

112
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,318
cools the dank i believe is what's

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,840
called rest in peace sub cool

114
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,560
some amazing genetics dna genetics

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
there's a huge list of of people i mean

116
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,598
this is just soft top my head i'm trying

117
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,319
to think of other ones that i've grown

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,079
in the past th seeds is another one that

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,759
i trust i think that that pretty much

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
answers the question for now what do you

121
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,759
think about topping auto flowers i don't

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,600
like to top autoflowers

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
every time i've done it i've just gotten

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
i feel like i've gotten less yield of

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
course it's impossible to measure if you

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
have two autoflower plants of the same

127
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
cultivar growing side by side they're

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,879
they're coming from seed they're

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,479
different phenos if you top one and let

130
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,959
the other one grow

131
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,879
it's not really a fair comparison

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,359
because they're different phenotypes

133
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,279
but it just seems like for me anytime i

134
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
topped an auto i just haven't gotten as

135
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,519
good of a yield

136
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,918
as when i don't top autos and just do

137
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,918
low stress training for example um it's

138
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,918
for autos the the highest yield i've

139
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,478
ever got was from a plant that i did

140
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,039
lost just low stress training no topping

141
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,079
no super cropping or anything i did

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
it was

143
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,719
carmilicious

144
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,038
that was by msnl genetics

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
and i got eight ounces off of that one

146
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,959
plant one autoflower just with low

147
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,599
stress training so

148
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,439
i'm definitely uh one of the ones that

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
just think low stress training is enough

150
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,000
for auto flowers do you do 72 hours of

151
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,319
darkness before harvest

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,639
sometimes there's really no studies out

153
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,560
there right now proving the point but

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,000
i've talked to so many people about this

155
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,478
people who know about plant physiology

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,319
and know about how trichome production

157
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,879
works i mean just look at my last garden

158
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,759
talk with mr grove podcast with tim

159
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,199
mccormick from culture biologics i asked

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
him a question about darkness before

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
harvest well actually i think he answers

162
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,638
that question before i could ask it to

163
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
him but um it's kind of one of those

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
things that's hard to measure as of

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
right now it's bro science until actual

166
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
science were to come out on it

167
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,719
i

168
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,399
have tried it i've done it before

169
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
i don't know if i've really seen it much

170
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
of a difference it kind of looks like

171
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,599
there's more trichomes on there but like

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
that's just me looking at it so

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,560
subjective i know that it's not going to

174
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,599
be harmful to do it you know what i mean

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
so if like

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
i put my lights off keep my lights off

177
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,439
maybe i'm busy and i can't harvest i'm

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
okay with leaving that plant in 48 hours

179
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,120
72 hours of darkness

180
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
i know the plan is going to be fine it's

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
not going to ruin the final product and

182
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,879
then when i have time i'll go and i'll

183
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,199
harvest it from there so sometimes i do

184
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,240
the 72 hours of darkness are you going

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,120
to show your freak show update that

186
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,960
sounds bad

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
freak show is one of my favorites to

188
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,399
grow so have you grown it before huh

189
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
granny garner yep update on that coming

190
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,120
soon um for those that don't know i

191
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,159

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,519
mj biz con vlog i actually got two freak

193
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,439
show cuts

194
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,799
from humboldt seco

195
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,800
and uh for those that don't know freak

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,439
show just google it and uh super excited

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,680
to to grow that one out i got two cuts

198
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
directly from the breeder

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,598
so directly from humboldt c code at

200
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,519
mjbizcon 2021 i walked up to the booth

201
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,800
and i was just was filming him and all

202
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,918
of a sudden the guy taps me on the

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
shoulder he's like you want to cut a

204
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,959
freak show and i'm like

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
wait

206
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,198
yeah

207
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,639
sure

208
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,160
and then he had they had like i think

209
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,280
three or four

210
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
huge freak show plants in the veg stage

211
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,279
and uh they were just cutting off clones

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,199
for everybody so i got a clone of that

213
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,198
and like two clones of that actually

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
both of them rooted so

215
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,478
i'll definitely be giving you guys an

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
update on that one i happen to have a

217
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,399
guaranteed femme producing manners the

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,240
whole crow is pollinated by pluck them

219
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,000
off the sacks and the lower buds will

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,519
the bigger buds still produce yeah so

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,478
how far along are you sorry to hear that

222
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,079
shark uh how far along are you yeah it

223
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,000
really depends so say that you're in

224
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,839
early flowering

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,478
i i personally would probably kill off

226
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,198
the plant if it was like

227
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,959
week four or earlier

228
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,080
if it's week five

229
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,239
i try to pluck off the nanners and

230
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,758
hope that they don't continue i see i've

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
had plants where

232
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
nanners would just produce like crazy

233
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,279
like you would pluck off some but like

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,598
you come back the next day and there

235
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,359
would be twice as many as before but

236
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,439
i've also had plants where i only had a

237
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
couple manners so you pluck off those

238
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,800
few manners the next day

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,439
you know you might spot one or two more

240
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,319
but it's like you can manage it right

241
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,560
now keep in mind when the plant exposes

242
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
nanners it's immediately releasing

243
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,800
pollen okay so any plants that you have

244
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,399
in that same grow space

245
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,639
it's getting pollinated nine times out

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,360
of ten you've got an oscillating fan on

247
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,278
immediately once that pollen is released

248
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
it's so fine it's blowing around that

249
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,120
gross space is a very good chance that

250
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
it has pollinated now does that mean

251
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
that you're going to be loaded with

252
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,958
seeds and all of your plants buds no

253
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,320
because it's just one manner you know

254
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,479
the amount of pollen there isn't going

255
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,519
to really destroy your crop in my

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,680
opinion but if it was like week five

257
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,519
week six i would try to definitely pluck

258
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,679
them off and then

259
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,839
hope that they fatten up and produce

260
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,399
ripen up uh and then hopefully you can

261
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
uh you can salvage that any great

262
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,639
question here from organic butt flap

263
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,399
when growing organic do you prefer hot

264
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,319
soil and water only or light soil with

265
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
lots of top dressing what are some

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
things to consider when making that

267
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
decision you know super soil is one of

268
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,320
those things where yeah try it out see

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,919
if you can amend the soil and balance it

270
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
out i recommend talking to somebody like

271
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,039
the soil doctor when you're adding

272
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,799
amendments and trying to get the right

273
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,958
ratios of nutrients in there i'm

274
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,958
personally not a soil scientist so i

275
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,639
don't i don't really try to take

276
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,278
different amendments and then make my

277
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,240
own super soil and hope that it works

278
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,320
out

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,000
because if there's an imbalance in any

280
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,760
of these elements in there

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,759
some can lock others out you know i mean

282
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,519
we have excess of some you're going to

283
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,278
see deficiency in others so i don't even

284
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,320
play around when it comes to that

285
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:55,120
um if you buy like an organic bag soil i

286
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
do like to do that at minimum like fox

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,080
found motion for soil a lot of you guys

288
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,199
know i use that that's soil that is

289
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
going to come with nutrients in it

290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,879
that's going to last you you know 30 40

291
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,879
days you know so depending on how much

292
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,519
you plant uh transplant

293
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,600
so uh you know in theory

294
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,879
that would be a little bit easier than

295
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
buying a

296
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,639
a blank soil let's say and then adding

297
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,559
amendments in it so buying the bag soil

298
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,639
you save a little bit of time there

299
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,078
uh and then added then top dressing top

300
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,600
dressing before

301
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,199
flipping the flour and then top dressing

302
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,278
again like 20 to 30 days in

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
so 20 to 30 days after that first dress

304
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,639
dressing is when i do the second top

305
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,079
dressing so that's mostly what i do is

306
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,439
just buy the

307
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,000
the bag soil for the most but i have

308
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
been reusing soil as well and then just

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,399
just re-amending and top dressing but

310
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,240
yeah either way i've done them both ways

311
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
yeah some things to consider when making

312
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,879
that decision is really you know how

313
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
much time do you want to spend doing it

314
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,799
you know because you have to do a little

315
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
bit of research and then also

316
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,519
buy the amendments all the different

317
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,879
amendments if you want to make your own

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
super soil

319
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,559
wondering what issues can happen if i

320
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
have to drive in a room with light

321
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,838
trying to see what options i have

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
limited to a small tent

323
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,440
so light is going to degrade the

324
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,440
trichomes really it's going to cause

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
your your trichomes to

326
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
continue to

327
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,759
mature right from the clear cloudy and

328
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,519
then amber at least that's what it said

329
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,240
or at least it's it's from maybe it's

330
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,959
just the thc to the amber but it

331
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,039
degrades the trichomes i don't know how

332
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,639
long it takes for that to be done i

333
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,958
don't know if anybody knows how long i

334
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,278
don't know if anybody's measured that if

335
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,719
we have the science on that one

336
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,399
but generally speaking it degrades the

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
trichomes you don't want to dry in light

338
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,919
if you can't could you still dry on

339
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
light nine times out of ten yeah you

340
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,599
should be fine you could ruin some

341
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,679
trichomes the bigger thing to worry

342
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
about is the actual temperature and

343
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,120
humidity you know when you're drying

344
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,399
keeping around 60

345
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
humidity

346
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,159
60 degrees fahrenheit try to get that

347
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,759
temperature low the higher the

348
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,439
temperature the more terpenes are gonna

349
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,039
evaporate so if you're going to be

350
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
drying in a room with light i'm assuming

351
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,078
maybe you're drying in your grow room

352
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,480
that gets

353
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,679
70 80 degrees fahrenheit

354
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
it's not ideal for drying but hey if you

355
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,719
that's the only thing you can do that's

356
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,239
the only thing you do right do you top

357
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
your photos yes i do top my photos so

358
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,680
typically i'll i mean i've done so many

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
different ways topped at the third note

360
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,000
top to the fourth note top to the fifth

361
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
note

362
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,879
let it grow to the fifth note drop top

363
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
down the fourth note there's so many

364
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,320
different ways you can go about it uh

365
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,838
topping at the fourth or fifth node just

366
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,920
doing that one top

367
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,560
and then leaving the lower branches to

368
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,399
grow up and pulling them out and keeping

369
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,319
an even canopy you can get a ton of

370
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,639
branches with just that one topping at

371
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
the fifth node for example so if

372
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,759
somebody's new to topping

373
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
just want to try it out for the first

374
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,000
time top of the fifth node let all those

375
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,320
branches kind of grow up continue to do

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
those low stress training so as a a

377
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,079
branch is kind of coming dominating

378
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,759
bring it down so the other branches can

379
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,199
grow up and if you have all those lower

380
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,879
branches growing up and they're uneven

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,240
canopy you get yourself a nice plant

382
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,240
that's going to yield high once the

383
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
earliest we can visually sex our plants

384
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,799
so coming from seed you're going to

385
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,278
as early as 21 days so if you were to

386
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,838
take a seed plant it directly into your

387
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,159
medium immediately put it on a 12-12

388
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,880
light cycle so flowering light cycle to

389
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,078
where phytochrome uh pr which is the

390
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,879
awake state

391
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,278
is not accumulating as much as pfr which

392
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,120
is kind of the night state florigen will

393
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,480
start to accumulate which is a flowering

394
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
hormone

395
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,759
and then it will start to flower but the

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
plant needs to spend

397
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,958
it's 21 days i believe as

398
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,360
my testing what i've done 21 days when i

399
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,159
first saw a pistol so i'd have to do it

400
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,320
for multiple plants to be sure 21 days

401
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,078
but that's the earliest i've ever caught

402
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
i don't know if anybody in the chat has

403
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,439
caught any earlier

404
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,120
so keeping on 12 12 light cycle from

405
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
seed have you seen pistols any earlier

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,078
than that you know the start of

407
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
flowering any earlier than that i'd love

408
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,120
to know do you use build-a-sill products

409
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,679
yes i do

410
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,679
i use their craft blend build soil craft

411
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,958
blend is what i've been using a lot

412
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,278
i'm trying to think of my growing i have

413
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,359
their alfalfa i have their insect frass

414
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,759
i have their build-a-flower

415
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,079
top dress kit i have their diatomaceous

416
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,159
earth which i haven't used yet i forget

417
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,159
what else i have their worm castings so

418
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,319
i do use their products wouldn't the ppm

419
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,399
be measured before watering you could

420
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,519
yeah i do both so i take a look at my

421
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,799
ppm before just to get an idea like for

422
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,159
example last night when i measured the

423
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,879
bpm was like 600 and then i also took

424
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,559
when i fed the plants took the runoff

425
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,919
measurement because nutrients are going

426
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,000
to build up right it's not like they're

427
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,958
going through 100 percent of the

428
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,559
nutrients from the last time around

429
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,799
so whatever the last time around

430
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,958
measurement was you get a figure that

431
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,759
the plant has eaten through some of that

432
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,599
plus if you're organics some amendments

433
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,399
have broken down so that number is

434
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
always

435
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,799
changing what your ppm number is so you

436
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
could take a look at your initial ppm

437
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,000
measurement

438
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,360
and take a look at your last measurement

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,480
and say okay last time it was a thousand

440
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,919
ppm

441
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,839
i'm assuming it's going to eat up to 300

442
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,479
over the last three days

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
i'm going to feed in 700

444
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
it should be in my rain between a

445
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,278
thousand and 1500 you know what i mean

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,920
so it's a total guessing game when it

447
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,439
comes to this whole ppm thing and

448
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,120
it's really these are just general

449
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,120
ranges you know like they said you

450
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,039
mentioned my book my my range i believe

451
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
is a thousand to i wanna say sixteen

452
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,838
hundred somebody said fifteen hundred i

453
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,079
thought it said sixteen hundred in the

454
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
book in flowering and i've had some

455
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,159
plants that were able to take more

456
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
without getting nutrient burn um and

457
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,519
i've had plants that weren't as hungry

458
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,879
didn't need to be fed as often could be

459
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
on the lower side of that thousand or

460
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,720
even a little bit less than that

461
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
thousand ppm and they've been fine so i

462
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,480
feel like this whole ppm thing is

463
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,799
definitely a guessing game thanks for

464
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
tuning into this q a video on the outro

465
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,799
card here the video on the left is the

466
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
previous q a video that i did and the

467
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,479
video on the right is automatically

468
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,519
generated by the youtube algorithm until

469
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
next time

470
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,839
peace
