Talk podcast today I am joined with

68
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,159
David sandelman how you doing today I'm

69
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,639
good how are you Chris good thanks for

70
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,759
asking so you are the inventor of the

71
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,799
canol I'm actually using one of those

72
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,759
I've been using it for over a year now

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,159
and uh we met at a conference I filmed

74
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,799
some footage with you explaining the the

75
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:55,039
katrol in in detail the cool cure and

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
actually one of my videos is dedicated

77
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,400
showing mostly you explaining everything

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,720
it has over 100,000 views wow so I know

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,480
a lot of my audience is aware of you

80
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,840
they're familiar with you and I'm really

81
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,639
happy today to be able to sit down with

82
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,759
you and really dig deeper into the krol

83
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,479
and really drying and curing in general

84
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,959
there's a lot of um a lot of

85
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,439
misinformation when it comes to that

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,840
process a lot of lack of information I

87
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,799
think we've learned a lot just in the

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,920
past three to five years so kind of

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,000
sitting down with you catching us up to

90
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,798
speed uh I think is going to be real

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
valuable for my audience so appreciate

92
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,319
you coming on today uh before we get

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
deep into the questions could you tell

94
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,759
us a little bit about yourself and kind

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,519
of how you got into gardening well um my

96
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:41,359
background is in designing uh control

97
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,200
systems and uh you know how I got into

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,959
this world was uh uh solving a problem

99
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:51,798
for cheese makers uh aging cheese which

100
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,799
led to uh shaku meat which then LED over

101
00:03:51,799 --> 00:04:00,599
to gardening and flowers and uh a lot

102
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,239
was uh by accident uh I took a uh a wine

103
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:06,039
cooler and why a wine cooler because

104
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,719
it's an insulated box with a door no

105
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,000
different I could have used a freezer I

106
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,239
could have used the refrigerator uh I

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,479
could have used the Yeti cooler but what

108
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,319
I needed was an insulated box with the

109
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,478
door so that was the simplest thing to

110
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,959
start with and the size was about right

111
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,839
for an insulated box with a door and

112
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,000
then applied the technology for

113
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,399
controlling the vapor pressure in the

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,439
space and then provide Ed that uh to a

115
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:39,000
local uh grower uh he was a caregiver

116
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:43,079
and so he was uh had lots of plants to

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,439
grow and I said try this and his first

118
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:51,000
comments were ah it's not going to work

119
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:54,160
I only dry my flow when it's hanging and

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,519
there were shelves in it I said humor me

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,960
just put the flour in there and try it

122
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,079
it may not come out as nice as you like

123
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,719
it's not hanging or what but just try it

124
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:08,560
and he did and about a week or two later

125
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,400
I went back to his shop and he said I

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,079
don't know what this is but this is some

127
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,159
of the best flower I've ever produced I

128
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,959
said could I have the box back he said

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,560
absolutely

130
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:24,879
not and he used it for well over a year

131
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,959
one of the first prototypes so wound up

132
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,038
in it you know I'm going to say a lot by

133
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,399
accident coming out of cheese and meat

134
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:36,000
and saying here's another product that

135
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,679
you need to remove extra water and what

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,839
is this extra water this water is

137
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:47,038
Unbound water and Unbound water is what

138
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:50,918
molds and microbes feed and grow on and

139
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,000
if you eliminate that Unbound water so

140
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,478
the only water left is bound water that

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,600
they can't access well they starve to

142
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:01,240
death they can't grow and you have a

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,280
shelf stable product and so in the food

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,280
industry in the pharmaceutical industry

145
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,559
they use water activity as the unit of

146
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,839
measure they don't talk about percent

147
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,120
moisture they talk about water activity

148
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,198
because that's the bound and Unbound

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
water and they want to make sure that

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,240
there's no not enough Unbound water for

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,840
microbes and mold to grow on so now you

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,639
have a shelf stable product and what you

153
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,119
don't want to do in food in

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,319
Pharmaceutical and in our world is take

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,918
out bound water because every molecule

156
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,319
of bound water you remove from that is

157
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,839
weight off the

158
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,400
scale and they sell their product by

159
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,719
weight it's a commodity so you don't

160
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,198
want to remove weight and just waste

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,199
that weight so that's why you know you

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,160
want to use water activity bound Unbound

163
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,319
water as the units of measure so little

164
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,560
bit circular description of how it got

165
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,080
started but that's ties into where it

166
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,280
all started with cheese and meat and

167
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:12,598
applying the same uh physics the same

168
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,878
technology to a flower uh that you want

169
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:18,918
shelf stability and that you want a

170
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,759
really good highquality product that

171
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,079
you're not removing weight since you're

172
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,840
selling it by weight that's awesome and

173
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,639
what year was canol established as a

174
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,159
company and then the cool cure which is

175
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,240
the hom grow dve box what year was that

176
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:38,199
invented H it's about four years ago

177
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,478
that I tinkered with the first prototype

178
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,960
and we tested it and we gave it to this

179
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,719
caregiver and once he said yeah this

180
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:50,279
really works we went to a little

181
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,720
advocacy group uh here in Vermont uh

182
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,638
where it was uh home Growers gathered

183
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,280
and traded notes and they would have

184
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,360
competition for their home grow and we

185
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,239
brought a box there put put it on a 6ft

186
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,960
folding table and uh I think we saw

187
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,759
three or four of them right on the spot

188
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,478
and that's when my wife and I looked at

189
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
each other and said maybe we have

190
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,800
something so we went home and built a

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,319
couple more that's so cool yeah I've

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,240
been using it for over a year like I

193
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,039
mentioned and uh I think it's a game

194
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,120
changer it help has helped me out so

195
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,560
much when it comes to drying just being

196
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,360
hands off more you know not having to me

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,959
mess with a humidifier a fan you know

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,158
within a grow tent I'm able to actually

199
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,559
Harvest put into the box press the on

200
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,319
button and then go on vacation it's

201
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,079
happened to me twice now where I

202
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,680
literally had to harvest and went on

203
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,519
vacation and came back several days

204
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,278
later and it was good to go so um the

205
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,159
convenience factor was a big thing for

206
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:50,120
me yeah now on the cool cure one thing

207
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,120
you emphasize is dupoint a lot of

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,959
Growers go by relative humidity but you

209
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,639
go by dupoint can you explain the

210
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,879
difference between the two and why

211
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,838
there's an emphasis on D Point versus

212
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,559
relative humidity yeah it this is a

213
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,399
common question and relative

214
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:11,599
humidity the first word relative it's a

215
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:14,320
relative value and um relative humidity

216
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,680
is made up of two variables and the two

217
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,160
variables that make up relative humidity

218
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,958
is the temperature of the air and the

219
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:25,078
amount of moisture in the air and if you

220
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:28,000
change either of those variables the

221
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:30,559
relative humidity is going to change so

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,519
when people say oh I can control

223
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:37,759
relative humidity well in reality you

224
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,560
can't it is not a controllable variable

225
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,480
unto itself because it's made up of two

226
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,518
the temperature and the amount of water

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,360
which we call dupoint in the air an

228
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,078
analogy I like to use is let's say you

229
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,680
have a loan and you want to change your

230
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:59,439
monthly payments well there's no dial to

231
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,319
turn up or down to change your monthly

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,480
payment you can change the interest rate

233
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
that'll change your monthly payment you

234
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
can change the principal amount of the

235
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,879
loan that will change your monthly

236
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,159
payment you can change the term of a

237
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,879
loan that will change your monthly

238
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,480
payment but there's no individual thing

239
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,240
that you can dial up and down that is

240
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,560
the monthly payment the monthly payment

241
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,680
is the result of these other variables

242
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,399
be it the length of the loan the

243
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,639
principal of the loan the interest of

244
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:35,159
the loan relative humidity is the same

245
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,439
relative humidity is the outcome of the

246
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,039
temperature of the air and the amount of

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,839
moisture in the air move either of those

248
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:47,120
and you move the relative humidity so

249
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,480
what do we doing we're controlling the

250
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,240
two

251
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,879
components that make up relative

252
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,200
humidity and so dupoint is the amount of

253
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,360
water and the temperature dryb

254
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,519
temperature is the amount of temperature

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,639
now you can add to subtract the uh

256
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,278
temperature of air that's easy heat it

257
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,320
cool it or you can add to subtract

258
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,360
moisture in the air and by controlling

259
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,200
those two variables that's where you

260
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,440
wind up with your resultant humidity so

261
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,079
at the end of the day when you're drying

262
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,600
and curing flour the relative humidity

263
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,239
is no longer important if you're able to

264
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,720
control the two important variables

265
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,360
what's the air temperature around the

266
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,839
flower and how much moisture or the

267
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,560
vapor pressure around the flower now

268
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,839
once you hold the right vapor pressure

269
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,599
and we found that a 54 degree D point

270
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,440
which relates to vapor pressure that's

271
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,519
interchangeable numbers the flour will

272
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,639
dry to

273
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,480
equilibrium the vapor pressure of the

274
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,959
flower will get reduced down to that

275
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,480
vapor pressure of a 54 degree dup point

276
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,000
and now it's at equilibrium the flower

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,759
won't dry anymore that's why you can go

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,679
on vacation and you can even say you

279
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,919
know what I'm not going home I'm going

280
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,359
to spend another week on vacation and

281
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,919
when you get home the flowers is not

282
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,399
going to overdry because it came during

283
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,759
your first week's vacation down to

284
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,078
equilibrium to match that dueo well you

285
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,958
spend another week away it's just going

286
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,479
to hold there at that same dupoint at

287
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:27,559
equilibrium what's happening now is

288
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,680
you're increasing the Cure on the flow

289
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,119
now other things are going on ripening

290
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,198
into tricomes and things like that but

291
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,959
it's not going to overd drry so that

292
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,519
also eliminates before you would put the

293
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,198
flower in a space with an air

294
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,320
conditioner A D humidifier and what are

295
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:46,359
they designed to do remove water

296
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,519
constantly remove water when you buy a

297
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,800
dehumidifier it's rated in pints per day

298
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,198
and it will do that forever until it

299
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:58,120
turns your flour into crispy little bits

300
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:02,120
so that's why at some point we would

301
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,839
dry cure because we had to arrest the

302
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,560
drying process because the room with the

303
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,680
air conditioners and humidifiers would

304
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,078
just keep sucking water out of it and

305
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:15,679
then move it to a sealed container to

306
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:18,879
arrest that drying where in a cool cure

307
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,679
it's at the finished place so it stores

308
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,919
there and holds understood and that's

309
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,838
where it really comes into the vapor

310
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,838
trol technology is my next question but

311
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,240
what I do want to mention which kind of

312
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:33,399
reminds me of dupoint versus relative

313
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,839
humidity is similar to like EC versus

314
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,440
PPM where electrical conductivity is

315
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,480
kind of that that absolute value uh and

316
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,600
then PPM is just a calculation of the EC

317
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,199
yes so that kind of reminds me of you

318
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,000
know dupoint EC and then RH being the

319
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,599
PPM uh it's kind of simpler people kind

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,679
of similar in the sense to where people

321
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,680
are still using PPM but EC is a little

322
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,559
bit more accurate in that Avenue it's

323
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,278
it's the primary unit of measure yeah

324
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,518
right that's D point is a primary unit

325
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,320
of measure where relative humidity is a

326
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,198
calculated value on the dupoint and the

327
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,800
temperature combined that's what the the

328
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,078
equation works out to be got it now

329
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,479
getting into the vapor trol technology

330
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,638
now this is uh something that you've

331
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,920
created I believe it's a a trademark

332
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,560
patent I believe you can cctm on that

333
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:31,439
what exactly is the VAP trol technology

334
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:34,319
so what we've been able to do is control

335
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,800
the vapor pressure in the in the space

336
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,079
as a controllable variable um which is

337
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,000
the D point so when I say vapor pressure

338
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,479
I'm talking D point if I'm saying D

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,799
point I'm talking vapor pressure um

340
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,720
there's an equation where you put E is

341
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,719
at one side vapor pressure and then and

342
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,839
all these other radicals and brackets

343
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,639
and stuff like that or the t's which are

344
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,399
the dupoint temperature so you can flip

345
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,198
the equation either way so you we can

346
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:07,198
use that interchangeably um up until now

347
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:10,039
um air conditioning systems uh de

348
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:15,039
humidifiers have what's called a

349
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:18,240
sensible to Laten ratio okay so when you

350
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,078
start cooling air once you cool it below

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,959
the dupoint condensation forms and you

352
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,439
start drying the air because that water

353
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,159
comes out as droplets on the fins on the

354
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,000
evaporator coil and drops out and you're

355
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:36,120
removing water from the air but those

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,759
units have the sensible latent ratio

357
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,360
which is pretty well fixed so it says

358
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,519
let's say you have a 7030 kind of split

359
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,039
it means 70% of the energy goes to

360
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,919
cooling the air and 30% of the energy

361
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:54,480
goes to drying the air what our patents

362
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:57,919
are about is we have split that so we

363
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,360
can independently control the dry bulb

364
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,838
temperature which is the sensible

365
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,440
capacity of a heating or cooling system

366
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,959
and the latent capacity the amount of

367
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,240
moisture we can remove from the air so

368
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,559
by doing that we can zero in and get you

369
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,600
the dry Bol temperature and the dupoint

370
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:23,879
temperature that you need to get to the

371
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,480
perfect conditions for drying curing and

372
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:32,318
storing and so far we have uh two

373
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:35,720
patents issued and we have a third one

374
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:38,039
back and forth normal course of dealing

375
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,959
with the u United States patent office

376
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,838
and a fourth application about to go in

377
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,719
with the patent office uh the uh

378
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,560
European patent office has already

379
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,959
approved this and we're have patents in

380
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,399
several European and foreign countries

381
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,078
as well oh that's pretty cool and yeah

382
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,240
on the cool cure you can have different

383
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,479
settings right uh I think a lot of

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,839
people are think that it's fixed on the

385
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,360
default settings but you can actually

386
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,880
change that um first of all what is your

387
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,479
recommended or default dry and cure

388
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,000
settings that you have on the cool cure

389
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,959
so we ship the units there are thousands

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,919
of them out there and proven over and

391
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,679
over again a 68 degree dry bulb

392
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:24,919
temperature and a 53 to 54 degree

393
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:28,519
dupoint is the best settings um if you

394
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,520
lower the dry bulb temperature it takes

395
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:33,359
long longer to dry the

396
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,519
material and it's a longer period that

397
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,959
you potentially have Unbound water where

398
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,000
you have the possibility of microbes and

399
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,880
mold to grow so at the settings we have

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,279
we get to a Target water activity in

401
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,280
about four days and then we recommend

402
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:55,119
four additional days of cure uh so

403
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:58,558
things can rip in and get better now

404
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,599
there's a lot of discussion about 6060

405
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,798
and now now first of all we get a lot of

406
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,678
people like get our unit and they go oh

407
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm going to set it to 6060 well the two

408
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,080
readings on the unit the first is the

409
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:15,600
dyall temperature so they set that at 60

410
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:18,279
but then they set the dupoint to 60 well

411
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:22,199
when the temperature is 60 and the D

412
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,359
point is 60 you are at 100% relative

413
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,000
humidity you're at saturation you've

414
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,240
created fog that is the perfect

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,679
conditions to take everything you put in

416
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,440
the unit and turn it into one moldy

417
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,759
gooey

418
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,919
mess so you can confuse 60% relative

419
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:45,558
humidity with a 60° dup point now we've

420
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,080
looked into trying to find the origins

421
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:53,480
of where did this 6060 come from well we

422
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:55,678
do know that a 60% relative humidity

423
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,240
will equate back through a bunch of

424
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,640
equations to a 6 water activity

425
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,480
so there's some some science behind that

426
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,240
but the 60°

427
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,400
temperature what we can surmise is when

428
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,079
people started putting it in rooms with

429
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,360
air conditioners if you brought it into

430
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,439
your bedroom and you hung the flow up

431
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,479
and the thermostat was set at 68° and

432
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,159
the compressor ran for a couple of

433
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,880
minutes every you know couple of times

434
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,720
an hour well it wasn't running long

435
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,039
enough to dry the air because it's only

436
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,360
taking moisture out of the air when the

437
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,519
compressor is running so how do we solve

438
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,959
the problem they would turn down the

439
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,918
therat to force the compressor to run as

440
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,079
much as possible so is actively removing

441
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:49,559
moisture from the air well if you look

442
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,839
at most uh mini splits with wireless

443
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,839
remotes or air conditioning thermostats

444
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:59,199
they only go down to

445
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:01,558
60° so is there science behind the 60°

446
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,120
or is the 60° because that's what most

447
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,720
thermostats will only go down to which

448
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,399
was it was set to to force the

449
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,759
compressor to run to constantly remove

450
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,880
moisture from the air we haven't really

451
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,158
gotten to the source of where that came

452
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,840
from but pretty much everything we've

453
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,840
come up with leads to that's the limit

454
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,319
of Home thermostats where you were

455
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,000
hanging your flow to try and dry it

456
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,759
that's interesting yeah anybody who I

457
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,839
really have talked to over the years

458
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,839
have told me hey 6060 that's the best

459
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,558
way to try it even the commercial

460
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,918
facilities Implement that and they're

461
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,480
using the 6060 but is that really the

462
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,919
best way or is that kind of like a Bro

463
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,319
Science technique where there's really

464
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,240
no studies to back it up that debate

465
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,839
still goes on today for sure it's it it

466
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,400
was the best that was available so what

467
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:57,119
did we do we worked with um the research

468
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,880
Coalition and they ran flour at 6060 and

469
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:04,599
they also ran flour hour well that's

470
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,600
60° temperature and 60% relative

471
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,759
humidity and ran it side by side with a

472
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:14,038
cool cure that was set at the factory

473
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:16,960
defaults of 68 degree dry bulb and a 54

474
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:21,240
degree dup points and they've now put

475
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,079
out a white paper and the tpes were 16%

476
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,200
higher coming added to the cool cure

477
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:31,759
with a 68° dry bulb and a 54° dupoint as

478
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,480
compared comp to the room that was at

479
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:38,480
6060 Legacy conventional so the data is

480
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,960
out and there is a white paper out now

481
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,079
that goes through all of the sciency

482
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,038
stuff that the PHD people did to these

483
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,558
tests typically you hear about the

484
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,119
higher the temperature the more tpine

485
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,000
loss there is does the Turpin volatize

486
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,158
at the higher temperature do you think

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,558
the reason for I haven't seen the white

488
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,200
paper do you think the the the overall

489
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,839
result one of the reasons why

490
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,000
result in that is the consistency in the

491
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,319
conditions and it being inconsistent

492
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,720
with the 6060 method kind of up and down

493
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,439
Swings with with temperature and

494
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,798
humidity yes we we are currently

495
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,400
undergoing now Research into what might

496
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,000
be happening and one of the things and

497
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
we it is yet to be proven and

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,599
demonstrated but this is the path we're

499
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,520
going down is that with conventional

500
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:31,119
equipment uh every time the

501
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,918
Refrigeration compressor Cycles on and

502
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,399
off whether it's with an air conditioner

503
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,240
or whether it's with a

504
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
dehumidifier when that liquid

505
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,839
refrigerant is injected into the

506
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,759
evaporator coil in that piece of

507
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:49,839
equipment um the temperatures are down

508
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:53,119
in the uh mid 20° fah to low 30s and

509
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,720
then when the compressor turns back off

510
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,839
well that coil is no longer cold so the

511
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,360
dup point and the vapor pressure Rises

512
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:04,199
so every time the compressor Cycles on

513
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:08,719
and off the vapor pressure dup point is

514
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,880
cycling up and down up and down now

515
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,360
think of the tops of your tricomes these

516
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,278
nice little bulbs and inside these bulbs

517
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:22,599
are all the tpin and all the good stuff

518
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,720
so what we're imagining is happening and

519
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,918
this is what we're doing with uh you

520
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:32,159
know electron microscopes and uh uh you

521
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,360
know digital microscopes is to see if

522
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,799
the cycling is causing these bulbs on

523
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,439
top to expand and contract expand and

524
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,679
contract and expand and contract and

525
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,840
eventually weaken and fail and now

526
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,360
you're losing your tpin once they fail

527
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:52,918
and what we're hearing about is shelf

528
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:56,918
stability if by us holding a constant

529
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,000
vapor pressure that those Tricom heads

530
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:02,600
are able to ripen

531
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,960
and become more sturdy and more durable

532
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:09,918
and so that way not until you grind and

533
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,880
smoke that flow do you now release those

534
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,080
goodies those tpen that are in those

535
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,799
triome heads yeah the fact that these

536
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,879
swings could potentially be causing a

537
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,038
rupture of tricomes and and a lost of

538
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,440
Tarpin is just it's a little bit

539
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,720
mind-blowing to think that that would

540
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,640
actually be happening and the stability

541
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,558
how important it really is and didn't

542
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,679
really know about that 5 years ago you

543
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,158
know now we do know about it so or have

544
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,440
the technology to maintain stability

545
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,440
true very true but taking a step back

546
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,720
one thing I did want to just touch upon

547
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,759
is we get lots of people asking can the

548
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,919
cool care be set to 6060 and yes it can

549
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,079
be you just have to adjust the dupoint I

550
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,919
don't have it memorized but there is a

551
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,119
setting for 60° Fahrenheit and then the

552
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,200
dupoint can be set so you can achieve

553
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,839
that 60% humidity so if you're a tinker

554
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,640
like me like I've tried with the 6060

555
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:06,959
I've tried 6360 I've tried 6560 I've

556
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,759
tried 6860 so I've messed around with it

557
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,720
quite a bit and really don't notice too

558
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,278
much of a difference to be honest with

559
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,240
you uhhuh yeah and uh you know it it's

560
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,640
you're getting into the

561
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,200
nuances and and with every unit is

562
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,840
shipped uh an instruction manual and in

563
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,960
the back of the manual is a chart and

564
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,519
you can look up for any given relative

565
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,480
humidity temperature what the D point is

566
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,119
so on that chart you would look up the

567
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,278
60° dry bulb you would look across the

568
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,918
chart to find the 60% relative humidity

569
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,159
and then it will tell you what the

570
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,278
dupoint setting

571
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,399
is and you're definitely then causing

572
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:52,880
the machine to work harder because it's

573
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,398
having to run at lower temperatures and

574
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
it's not a refrigerator there's no

575
00:25:55,398 --> 00:26:01,599
compressor so it you know it's not

576
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,679
designed to be cooling to those you know

577
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,519
it can but you know it sweet spot is

578
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,440
where they run understood and so the

579
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:15,359
default settings on the cool cure equals

580
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,159
a dry length to be 4 days some people

581
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,038
may say that's a little bit too fast

582
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,760
others say that's perfectly fine that's

583
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:25,119
probably the the fastest you want to dry

584
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:28,599
at what length of dry is too fast and

585
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:31,199
what are the downsides for a fast dry

586
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,959
okay so let's start with what's the

587
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,080
definition of dry and what have people

588
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,759
been using as a unit of measure for dry

589
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,158
they typically were probably looking at

590
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,759
stem snapping which is a pretty

591
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,799
arbitrary thing or moisture

592
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:53,558
content and when you're looking at

593
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:57,200
moisture content well that's not

594
00:26:53,558 --> 00:27:00,240
representative of uh bound and Unbound

595
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,399
water which is expressed by way of water

596
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,440
activity so when we say the flower is

597
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:10,479
dry we're talking about achieving a

598
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:14,480
water activity of 6 which means it's now

599
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,960
shelf stable that you've removed all the

600
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,759
Unbound water now at that point is

601
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,440
someone going to consider it dry uh we

602
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,519
like to see four more days of cure on it

603
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,080
uh even though the water activity is no

604
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,200
longer going to

605
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:36,918
change so but what can happen is if you

606
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,240
dry something too quickly and this is

607
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,440
doable if you put that flower in a very

608
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,798
low uh dupoint space very low vapor

609
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,600
pressure space you can do what's called

610
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,879
case hardening and this also applies to

611
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:57,278
the food industry that the outer water

612
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:00,919
leaves very quickly and that causes a

613
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:04,000
case hardening and you trap water inside

614
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,600
the inside water can't get out because

615
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you've sort of created a casing on the

616
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:13,398
outside um and that happens in shakuri

617
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,240
if you're drying a salami and you dry

618
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:18,398
the casing on the outside too quickly

619
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,880
the moisture in the center of that meat

620
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,000
can't get out anymore you've case

621
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,278
hardened it and what you will wind up

622
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,919
with is rancid meat because your water

623
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:31,319
activity in the center is still too high

624
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,399
and microbes and all kinds of other

625
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,720
nasties can breed in there because

626
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,278
there's still free available water so

627
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,759
the mechanics probably apply perfectly

628
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,079
well to uh a flower that you remove the

629
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,798
water out of too fast got it and I know

630
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,480
just from uh you know smoking perception

631
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,359
it's can become very harsh it's a fast

632
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,240
dry I've noticed a haast smell on a lot

633
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,038
of things that I've dried real fast and

634
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,759
it's just been very harsh and not

635
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,519
pleasant when consuming now on the other

636
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,398
end of things when talking about the

637
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,798
length of dry being too slow how many

638
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,599
days would you say is kind of too slow

639
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:11,240
of a dry and what are the downsides of

640
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:14,558
having a slow dry okay so back to water

641
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,960
activity the longer you have free

642
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:21,079
available water in that flow the longer

643
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,519
that flour is exposed the possibility of

644
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,480
mold and growth going on in there so you

645
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,720
don't want it sitting around with free

646
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,960
available water for an extend length of

647
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,640
time it's going to go moldy yeah that's

648
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
why we like hitting that water activity

649
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,519
you know in about 4 days as far as

650
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,720
number of days though I've heard as low

651
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,399
as or as maximum as 10 you shouldn't go

652
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,600
any more than 10 days through drying at

653
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:48,719
least bringing that water activity down

654
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,439
to the 6 would you agree with that or

655
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,278
disagree with that is 10 days or longer

656
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,000
too long I personally would not want it

657
00:29:54,278 --> 00:30:00,398
any longer than it needs to be cuz any

658
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,398
day longer is another day you are ex you

659
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:06,439
are exposed to the possibility of mold

660
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:09,439
and bacterial growth you know back to

661
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,278
what our you know objective is is to get

662
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,640
to a shelf stable

663
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:18,119
product and you know at 4 days you're

664
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,278
pretty you know you're good now can you

665
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,918
get the water activity down to a0 6 in

666
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,200
one day uh I've not tried it You'

667
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,240
probably wind up case hardening it and

668
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,960
not be able to get bound water out from

669
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,120
the center so we're typically seeing by

670
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:39,038
day four your water activity at 6 but

671
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:42,278
then another 4 days of cure and there

672
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,079
might be during those additional 4 days

673
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:46,640
some additional

674
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,199
Equalization of water activity

675
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,759
throughout the structure now at the end

676
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,600
of 8 days you have really high quality

677
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:59,200
smokable flour not harsh smooth but you

678
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:03,199
can then leave it there 30 days uh last

679
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,319
night we pulled uh Golden Goat out of a

680
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,399
cool cure that's been in there a month

681
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,918
short of a year and it's still sticky

682
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:12,199
that's incredible now you mentioned

683
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,240
water activity youve touched upon it

684
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,038
several times now I have a lot of folks

685
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
here that are tuning in that this is the

686
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,638
first time they're ever hearing of water

687
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
activity you know that might be more in

688
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,558
the beginner stage or whatever for

689
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
whatever reason this is the first time

690
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,599
they're actually hearing about water

691
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,240
activity you mentioned 6 is 6 the Target

692
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,199
can we get a little deeper into water

693
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,079
activity you know what is it what's the

694
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,919
actual Target why is 6 the target so on

695
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,599
and so forth okay so there's been all

696
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,720
kinds of research uh water activity is

697
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,879
unit of measure that's been used for

698
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,679
decades uh by the pharmaceutical

699
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:53,760
industry by the food industry they only

700
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,399
deal in water activity um what we are

701
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,638
speculating is if uh there's

702
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,239
rescheduling from schedule one to

703
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:05,479
schedule 3 um and the FDA gets involved

704
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,278
FDA Talks water activity and everyone's

705
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,639
got to learn water activity because

706
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,599
that's the unit of measure they look at

707
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:17,079
for shelf stability and products you

708
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:22,398
know that that's a unit of measure um so

709
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:25,480
with Decades of research and stuff at 6

710
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:28,599
the microbes and mole that grow that

711
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,000
will be harmful could no longer

712
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:37,000
survive in an an object something that

713
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,960
has a 6 water activity even museums that

714
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,200
have rare documents measure water

715
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,960
activity and they want to make sure

716
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,960
those documents at are point six or

717
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,079
lower because they don't want mold and

718
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,360
microbes to eat up those rare documents

719
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,119
and open up a box and there's dust in

720
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,158
there so they too are interested in

721
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,638
water activity here's where food

722
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,600
industry uses water

723
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:07,359
activity if you ever get those little

724
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:10,199
cracker cheese

725
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:14,359
sandwiches now cheese you would think is

726
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,080
wet and a cracker is dry so why after

727
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:20,278
you open that package after it's been in

728
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:23,879
there for months aren't those crackers

729
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:27,038
mushy because they make sure that the

730
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,399
cheese and the crackers are at the same

731
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,240
water activity when they're manufactured

732
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:34,879
and put together so now with the same

733
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,079
water activity there's no water that can

734
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,919
transfer from the cheese to the Cracker

735
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,319
or vice versa we're not talking percent

736
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,559
moisture we're talking water activity

737
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,240
which is sort of a unit of measure and

738
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,200
that's why those crackers don't get

739
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,440
soggy from the cheese because you

740
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,038
normally say cheese is wet cracker is

741
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,240
dry but it's all about the science of

742
00:33:54,038 --> 00:34:01,759
water activity there's all kinds of of

743
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,240
uh research and Wikipedia and stuff that

744
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,638
talks about water activity so we're

745
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,079
taking a

746
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:12,480
technology that's been used for decades

747
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,320
with all kinds of research and

748
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,320
understanding and now just applying

749
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,399
it to something different but physics

750
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:26,720
Stills apply and there are these charts

751
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:29,638
and diagrams that show water activity at

752
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:33,519
.98 7

753
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,240
6.5 and through the different values

754
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,039
they show which

755
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,719
microbials can flourish you know where

756
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:44,039
the cut off line is and what they find

757
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,719
is once you get to 6 you're in a happy

758
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,960
safe place really the numbers 65 is

759
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,878
where all of the the nasties you don't

760
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,720
want to grow fall off once you get down

761
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,960
to a0 65 there's no longer that water to

762
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,358
free available water to feed them so we

763
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,440
like to say 6 so we got that little half

764
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,679
a point in there from 6 to point you

765
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,519
know 65 down to 6 to make sure we're in

766
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,199
the the happy Zone and then correct me

767
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,320
if I'm wrong if I'm drying in my cool

768
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,519
cure and it goes to that 4day dry cycle

769
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,160
on the default settings it's safe to

770
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,920
assume at that point that the product

771
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:22,078
inside is at the0 6 water activity at

772
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,119
that point is that right correct that's

773
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,920
what we find and that's that's at the

774
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,280
default settings we set it at we've not

775
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,079
done extensive research at the 6060

776
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,200
number uh because well we you know we've

777
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,560
tested it where the factory settings are

778
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:44,838
and where people have the most success

779
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:48,078
so will you get to a 6 water activity

780
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:51,199
with a 6060 equivalent value that I

781
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,318
don't know it might be a it might be a

782
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,838
day or two longer I do believe that the

783
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,800
lower the temperature the slower it is

784
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,519
to dry so it might push you into that 5

785
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,440
day 6 days but without testing it I'm

786
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,318
not 100% sure okay and then you touched

787
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,800
upon vapor pressure several times so far

788
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:10,440
and that's another thing that I feel

789
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,839
like a lot of my viewers are going to

790
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,800
hear VPD and they're going to be like

791
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,000
wait a minute the plants not growing

792
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,160
anymore correct VPD doesn't really

793
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,400
matter right it's like uh you know using

794
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,799
VPD while the plant is growing it

795
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,039
controls the stomata opening now when

796
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,960
the plant is drying there's no real

797
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,838
stomata for it to open doesn't really

798
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:35,559
affect affec in that Avenue no you're

799
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:37,719
right VPD applies to a living plant why

800
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,440
because the plant is actively putting

801
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:43,279
water out through the stamata and you're

802
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,318
going to that if you know what your Leaf

803
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,519
surface temperature is you can calculate

804
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,559
the saturated vapor pressure of the leaf

805
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,800
and now you have a vapor pressure at the

806
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,480
leaf and then you want to set up the

807
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,640
vapor pressure in the room and you want

808
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,119
to set up a different between the two so

809
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,759
that the water leaving the leaf can

810
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,039
freely flow into the room and not hang

811
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,599
out underneath the leaf where you're

812
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:14,920
going to get microbial growth mold

813
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:18,720
things like that so you are basically

814
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:22,318
maintaining a fapor pressure difference

815
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:26,159
between the leaf and the room almost

816
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:28,119
think about a pump maintains a pressure

817
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,598
difference between in and out you're

818
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,920
sort of creating this difference so

819
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,240
there's this constant flow of the water

820
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,880
vapor from the leaf into the room and

821
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,919
you don't want it to fluctuate you want

822
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,079
a constant flow now let's take that leaf

823
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,000
that that the leaf the flower that you

824
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,640
just cut off it's dead now it's got a

825
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,119
finite amount of water there's no more

826
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:54,759
Roots connected to it to bring up water

827
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,160
so it's it's got an absolute amount of

828
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,760
water it's starting with and so has a

829
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:04,318
vapor pressure and now you're going to

830
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,599
put it in a space like a cool cure which

831
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:09,559
has a lower vapor pressure and the vapor

832
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,280
pressure is set based on the 54 degree

833
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:15,199
dup point and that flow has a higher

834
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,519
vapor pressure there is a difference but

835
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,318
we're not going to talk about vapor

836
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,960
pressure deficit what's going to happen

837
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:22,318
is that flour is just going to start

838
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,720
losing

839
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:27,800
water because it's at a higher vapor

840
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:31,199
pressure but it's now going to

841
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,880
consistently go lower and lower and

842
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:37,598
lower until it comes to equilibrium with

843
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:41,599
the space you've dried it so vapor

844
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:45,119
pressure deficit is a proper term for a

845
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,039
flower room live plants water constantly

846
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,519
coming

847
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:52,199
out would you talk about vapor pressure

848
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,519
deficit when you take a knife and put it

849
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:56,879
through the sidewall of a

850
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,000
tire well there's a vapor pressure

851
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,519
difference when when the tire is full

852
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,280
and then after you pull the knife out

853
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,679
when the tire is flat they've now

854
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,720
equalized the vapor pressure in the tire

855
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,440
is the same as outside the tire it's a

856
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,799
flat tire that's an

857
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,800
equilibrium and when you before you cut

858
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,680
the hole in the tire there was a

859
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,760
difference but you really don't talk

860
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,919
about that it's just that the tire is a

861
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,720
30 PSI and now the tire is at zero same

862
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,480
thing with the flow the flow had a high

863
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,559
vapor pressure and now it's dry it's

864
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,599
equilibrium to the space so is there an

865
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:36,400
ideal VAP vapor pressure for drying or

866
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:40,039
is curing storage yes the 54 degree

867
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,000
dupoint got it if you know 54 degree

868
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:45,838
dupoint you can calculate vapor pressure

869
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,920
it's a linear it's it's a one for one

870
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,679
there's a straight equation you put in D

871
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,639
point and it gives you vapor pressure

872
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,358
you put in vapor pressure and it gives

873
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:57,879
you due point so what is the flow

874
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:00,239
starting at it's a live flow I don't

875
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,920
know it depends probably on the cultivar

876
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:07,479
the size of the flower you know all of

877
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,880
those can vary how much water is in that

878
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,240
flower when it's freshly picked but all

879
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,318
we do know is it's wet and we're going

880
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:19,879
to put it in an environment like a cool

881
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:22,719
cure where the vapor pressure is known

882
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,240
and then that flour is going to lose its

883
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,559
excess water until it comes to

884
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:30,759
equilibrium with the space and at that

885
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,880
point it's going to be at a0 6 water

886
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,640
activity it's not going to have any

887
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,440
Unbound water it's a shelf stability and

888
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:43,719
you got happy life that makes sense so

889
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,480
after the drying comes curing now this

890
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:49,598
is another debated topic here of as far

891
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,679
as length of cure how long does flow

892
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,240
need to cure for okay it so we find you

893
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,279
like to have a minimum of 4 days so like

894
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,039
eight8 days from when you put a flour

895
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,040
into a cool cure 8 Days Later you're

896
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:07,318
smoking some pretty amazing flour but we

897
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:10,960
what we have learned and experienced

898
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:12,279
firsthand is that different cultiv ours

899
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,480
age

900
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,359
differently pure differently so now you

901
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,880
can think about

902
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,358
wines and how some wines the day they

903
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,400
make it it's drinkable and if you let it

904
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,318
sit for 2 years or 20 years it's not

905
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,639
going to get any better if anything it's

906
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,480
going to get worse where there are other

907
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:36,039
wines that when they're freshly made

908
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,039
aren't so good to drink and you got to

909
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:41,599
let it lay for 20 years to mature and

910
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,960
then it gets better so we had that same

911
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,240
firsthand experience we grew a Jil bean

912
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,599
and an aapco gold side by side harvested

913
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:55,679
them both put them in a cool cure at 8

914
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:59,280
Days the Jil Bean as always a favorite

915
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:02,759
it was great we tried the aapco gold it

916
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,079
was harsh it was nasty it was like this

917
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,760
is disgusting we're a bit of snobs let's

918
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,920
throw it away no no let's leave it in

919
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:16,359
the Box 30 days later that aapo became

920
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,280
the new favorite so what we learned is

921
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:21,759
that particular

922
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,599
cultivar does better with a longer

923
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,680
period of cure time as compared to let's

924
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,640
say a Jil bean and we've got got some

925
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,440
commercial facilities who said you know

926
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,279
we've you know come back with them and

927
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,679
said I really would prefer now what I

928
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,240
know to have a different dry cure room

929
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:43,399
for each one of my cultivars because I

930
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:46,519
can see the difference and having one

931
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,280
room I got to compromise to come up with

932
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,759
the best for all W it's pretty

933
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,720
interesting yeah cultivar specific um

934
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,319
you know you hear about that but you

935
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,279
explaining the difference between just

936
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,199
those those two cultivars is like it's

937
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,280
pretty pretty blowing you know that it

938
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:02,879
can be such a big difference between the

939
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,079
two and and then what's happened now is

940
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,280
you have an environment that's

941
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,000
repeatable and consistent so up until

942
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,359
now without having that consistent

943
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,199
repeatable

944
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,598
environment uh there were too many

945
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:21,439
random things that would affect the

946
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,838
drying phase then the curing phase and

947
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,200
at what point did you arrest the drying

948
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:29,719
and put it into a jar or and then

949
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,159
burping what time of year did you open

950
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,759
that jar to burp it in the middle of the

951
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,838
winter when it's bone dry or did you

952
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,040
open it to burp it in the middle of the

953
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:43,799
summer when it's soaking wet outside all

954
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:46,558
those would affect the outcome so you

955
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,359
really couldn't tell what your outcome

956
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,920
was caused by and all of these other

957
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,078
random uncontrollable environmental

958
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,318
conditions now you have the ability to

959
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,480
put a flower and doesn't matter what

960
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,920
time of year it is is it doesn't matter

961
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,800
where you are in the high desert or down

962
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,400
on FL in Florida or on the coast um

963
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,240
you're going to have the same results in

964
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,838
the Box repeatedly over and over again

965
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,519
that's awesome now let's flip it up

966
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,759
let's talk about a wine fridge versus a

967
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:17,199
canol so I've gotten comments on videos

968
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,640
particularly the ones talking about the

969
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,919
cool cure and I did a review video and I

970
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:25,039
did a video kind of just talking about

971
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,119
the unit and um a lot of people had said

972
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,119
oh I'll just buy a wine fridge and drink

973
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,119
dry in there can you talk about the

974
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,838
differences between you know trying to

975
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,720
dry in a wine fridge versus a krol so

976
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:40,318
the reality is uh we need a a sealed box

977
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:44,759
an insulated box with a

978
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:47,800
door and we can buy these boxes

979
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,640
insulated boxes with doors that were

980
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,800
originally designed to be a wine

981
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,039
fridge but that's all we're getting is

982
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,880
the insulated box with the door there's

983
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:02,838
nothing else about about it other than

984
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,358
its visual look or size that makes it a

985
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:08,920
wine fridge it isn't it's an insulated

986
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:11,880
box with a door then we put all our

987
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,559
technology into it and it's some pretty

988
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,280
Advanced patented technology it's not

989
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,480
like you can put some beers in there and

990
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,960
keep them cold it's not what it it's no

991
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,639
it's an insulated box with a door we

992
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,199
don't have cooling systems in there per

993
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:31,358
se that you would put in a fridge

994
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:34,118
doesn't exist and what helps us because

995
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:37,199
these things are expensive to build and

996
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:39,559
we're building them here in the US and

997
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,000
we take really good care of you know our

998
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,720
staff and they're you know well taken

999
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,559
care of it gets expensive so one of the

1000
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:51,000
places we are able to help control the

1001
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:54,359
cost is to buy an insulated box with a

1002
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,719
door that is made by the Millions for

1003
00:45:54,358 --> 00:46:00,358
another

1004
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:02,598
application and so we're able to uh get

1005
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:05,558
you know help reduce that cost of

1006
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,280
materials by repurposing what is

1007
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:10,200
starting out to be an insulated box with

1008
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,280
the door that otherwise could be

1009
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,879
destined to be a wine cooler so what

1010
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,200
would happen if somebody tried to dry in

1011
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,838
in just a wine fridge they'll mess up

1012
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,399
because there's no vapor pressure

1013
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,078
control there's no control other than

1014
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,838
temperature so don't waste your money

1015
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,400
just use your regular household

1016
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,838
refrigerator uh it gets too dry cuz

1017
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,318
moisture is kind of being removed in

1018
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:34,279
that sense right correct yep there's

1019
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:36,358
there's no fast dry over dry no control

1020
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,280
of vapor pressure so what it'll happen

1021
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,759
is it'll keep continue drying drying

1022
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,440
drying and like any other system you're

1023
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,880
now going to be back to a two-step

1024
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,480
process where okay is it dry is it dry

1025
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,119
enough or I got to address the drying

1026
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,960
take it out and then go put it in sealed

1027
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,559
containers and if I took it out too soon

1028
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,880
and there's still free available water

1029
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,000
when I put it in that sealed container I

1030
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,079
need to burp that sealed container where

1031
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,199
I'm going to get stuff moldy or if I

1032
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,318
took it out and it was too late and now

1033
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:10,558
I put it in that sealed container and

1034
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:13,679
then I open that sealed container

1035
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,720
repeatedly in a very dry clim it I'm

1036
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:20,879
just continuing to overdry that

1037
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:23,239
flour so no a wine cooler won't do it

1038
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,400
nor will it dehydrator do it couple

1039
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:26,078
people have mentioned in the comments

1040
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,119
section like oh I'll just take a sponge

1041
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,318
just like the has and I'll put that in

1042
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:32,880
the wine fridge for drying so that'll

1043
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:35,838
help adjust the humidity and well back

1044
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
to adjusting humidity we we covered that

1045
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:40,480
topic and then where where did they dial

1046
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,079
in the vapor pressure or dupoint which

1047
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,240
is what's really controlling the drawing

1048
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,400
all they can control is the temperature

1049
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:51,919
so wine fridge no brain o for drying got

1050
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,599
it now how about for just curing and

1051
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,800
storage let's say that they store in

1052
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,440
jars okay mason jars uhhuh and the jar

1053
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,599
is sealed and they have humidity

1054
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,440
controls maybe they have one of those

1055
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,599
humidity packets in the jar so that's

1056
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,519
controlled and they put that in the wine

1057
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,200
fridge just for curing and storage is

1058
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:14,599
that an acceptable thing to do or would

1059
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:16,358
you advise against that well if they

1060
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,599
already have a cool cure there's no

1061
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:22,880
reason to do any of that because they're

1062
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,440
taking their flour out of a controlled

1063
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:30,000
environment that's going to maintain it

1064
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:33,480
at the exact precise vapor pressure for

1065
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
longterm curing and storing and then

1066
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,559
going to put it into a jar and screw the

1067
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,920
lid on it we don't know exactly what the

1068
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:47,880
environment is in the jar now we can add

1069
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:52,240
uh disin packs into that jar which are

1070
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,440
now trying to uh control the vapor

1071
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,279
pressure in that jar where they already

1072
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,200
took it out of a box where they had it

1073
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,519
under perfect control but now they're

1074
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:05,279
trying to do it another way um it's a

1075
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:08,079
lot of extra steps and I'm not really

1076
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,119
sure what the objective is where in a

1077
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:14,000
cool cure we now offer hemp bags where

1078
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,039
you take your finished flow you put it

1079
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,679
in a hemp bag and you just leave it in

1080
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:20,920
there on the shelf and it's great you

1081
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,318
mark the hemp bag with a sharpie what

1082
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,798
the cultivar was what the harvest date

1083
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:26,759
and over a period of time you have a

1084
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,280
whole library in there you open the door

1085
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,920
let's see what are we going to smoke

1086
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,960
today we want some of this you know Kush

1087
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,838
one of this blueberry some you know I've

1088
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,880
been using the brown paper bags because

1089
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:41,400
I think you guys were using that before

1090
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,720
yep the uh the hemp bags those on I have

1091
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,160
to pick up some H bags yeah now let's

1092
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:47,239
say they don't have a citrol and they

1093
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,879
just want a store in the wine fridge oh

1094
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:54,279
if they then yeah then they're looking

1095
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:57,160
to if they've got the flow to some

1096
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,440
Target water activity

1097
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:02,920
and not moisture content and they put it

1098
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,039
in a jar and the conditions of the air

1099
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,798
you know when they close the jar are

1100
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,798
about where it should be um and they put

1101
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:13,719
some disant pack to help stabilize it

1102
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:16,559
yeah then putting it in a wine cooler is

1103
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:19,199
maintaining a stable temperature and

1104
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,000
there's nothing wrong with that and you

1105
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,759
know brings up an interesting point you

1106
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
know you talk we go back to the

1107
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,920
6060 and if you talk to the wine world

1108
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,920
oh wine likes to be stored at

1109
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,400
55° well has anyone sat down with a

1110
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,358
glass of wine and asked the wine what

1111
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,680
its Optimum temperature where is it

1112
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:46,400
happy to be and the reality is four or

1113
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,519
500 years ago a thousand years ago

1114
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,519
they've been drinking wine a long

1115
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:55,639
time and they found that if you keep it

1116
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,318
in caves that's where you can store it

1117
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,679
and what's unique about about a cave

1118
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:04,400
it's got a stable temperature and the

1119
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:11,159
mean temperature underground is

1120
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:13,720
55° so was to 55 designed for the wine

1121
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:16,639
or did the wine happens to be in stable

1122
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:20,879
temperature caves that happen to be at

1123
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:24,400
55 maybe that Wine's happy at 58 well

1124
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,079
maybe that Wine's happy at 52 we know

1125
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,720
for sure if you put it at 90 it's not

1126
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,359
going to be so good but is there magic

1127
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:33,959
about the 55 or is the magic about

1128
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:37,558
keeping the temperature stable where you

1129
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:41,519
store it so now back to yes keep that

1130
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:44,519
flow in stable temperature conditions at

1131
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,480
a minimum if you don't have control of

1132
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,639
the vapor pressure of the flow at the

1133
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,159
same time got it there's a couple other

1134
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:55,118
devices that are often compared to the

1135
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:57,239
canol humidor what if somebody dried in

1136
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,280
a humidor is that uh efficient drying

1137
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:02,959
advice uh drying system the humidors

1138
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,599
don't have active vapor pressure

1139
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,519
control okay basically they're holding

1140
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,280
some temperature and then they're

1141
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,079
typically controlled with a disin pack

1142
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,319
of some sort okay and then another one

1143
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,440
is the egg incubator could you dry in

1144
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,318
that what are eggs like to incubate

1145
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,798
underneath the chicken they like nice

1146
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,000
warm

1147
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:24,679
temperatures and what a nice warm

1148
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,519
temperatures due to your flour they boil

1149
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:32,879
off your tpin so so we spoke about you

1150
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:35,960
know the 60 60 versus we use 68 you're

1151
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,400
still below the temperature where tpes

1152
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,318
tend to volatilize once you get into the

1153
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,318
high 7s low 80s that's when they all

1154
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:46,838
really start rocking and rolling and

1155
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:49,880
boiling off and uh yeah incubators

1156
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:51,599
they're nice warm cozy places they

1157
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,640
wouldn't want to dry in there either

1158
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,880
that an inator would be no different

1159
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:59,639
than like a food dehydrator okay I a

1160
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,960
product specific question from a viewer

1161
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,838
this viewer had mentioned that they were

1162
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,318
advised to dry in a grow tent for one

1163
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:09,599
day then put into the Cel cure yes is

1164
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,519
that ideal or can people just put it

1165
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,280
straight from Harvest straight from C

1166
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,960
the plant down into the cool cure it so

1167
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:20,519
it depends um it depends on how much uh

1168
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,798
plant matter you have um you know and

1169
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:26,960
there is a limit to how much uh a cool

1170
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:29,838
cure can take um so if you are in a

1171
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,280
rather dry environment and you can take

1172
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,759
your plant and hang it for a day or so

1173
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,720
you're going to lose a good chunk of

1174
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,520
water during that period which will give

1175
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:44,558
you the ability to put more into the

1176
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:48,039
cool cure to start with um not much

1177
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:50,400
different than soaking wet towels going

1178
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:52,558
into your clothes dryer you can ring

1179
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,440
them out before you throw them into the

1180
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,000
Clos dryer it'll help the Clos dryer but

1181
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,920
if you don't have a whole lot to throw

1182
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,880
in your clothes dry just toss them in

1183
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,280
it's going to dry anyway so it's more of

1184
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,039
a technique in order to kind of fit more

1185
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,640
product within the cool cure to maximize

1186
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:11,599
it that's right yeah yep but if it's not

1187
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,480
if it's not an issue uh some people you

1188
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:17,119
know you get into that Harvest period

1189
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:19,599
want to turn it over pretty quickly so

1190
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,559
that buys them some time by doing it for

1191
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,280
a day outside before they're utilizing

1192
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,640
the

1193
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,400
unit for bringing more flour in if

1194
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,719
you're not in those time constraints or

1195
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,440
volume constraints no just throw it in

1196
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:35,439
there you don't need to do it okay good

1197
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,720
to know yeah I've just been harvesting

1198
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,079
and then cutting the individual branches

1199
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,239
up taking off the larger fan leaves and

1200
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,039
then putting into the actual cool cure

1201
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:45,479
and that's working out great for me the

1202
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:49,440
larger fan all fan leaves all they do is

1203
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:52,119
adding uh water to remove that has no

1204
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,200
value I also have heard strange things

1205
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:57,599
like oh should I turn the plant upside

1206
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:01,199
down to hang and like the they were

1207
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:04,240
saying it was almost as if the sap was

1208
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,558
going to flow through the stems and wind

1209
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:09,199
up in the tricomes

1210
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,839
no there's nothing running down the

1211
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,439
stems into the tricomes I've heard so

1212
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,798
many different things some of the

1213
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,400
comments I get on YouTube is just so

1214
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:21,559
farfetched one comment I remember

1215
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,358
vaguely is somebody had mentioned that

1216
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:28,200
the tricomes should rupture during the

1217
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:31,558
drying a curing process for a more Oozy

1218
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,558
and sticky

1219
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:36,318
result I didn't know if it was just a

1220
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,558
troll like just trying to troll and get

1221
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,440
people to like I don't know have a bad

1222
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,400
dry or or if they' actually thought that

1223
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,920
ah there's some crazy ideas out there

1224
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,559
yeah so the final product coming from

1225
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,519
the cool cure right so you've dried it

1226
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,798
for four days youve got the 4 days worth

1227
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:56,920
of curing 8 days and you can keep it in

1228
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:58,318
there for really several months years

1229
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,159
kept it in there and it's been a great

1230
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:05,440
product how do you describe the final

1231
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:10,679
product okay it's uh fluffy not fluffy

1232
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:15,039
in a lightwe more uh spongy uh and

1233
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:18,519
sticky um when you grind it and we found

1234
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,000
now instead of a grinder that shreds

1235
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:25,079
we're using these things called flour

1236
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,639
Mills and the consistency is amazing

1237
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:32,519
it's easy to roll it like sort of has

1238
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:36,679
the spongy and it just lays out nicely

1239
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:40,519
smooth there's no hacking you know it's

1240
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:42,719
rare if ever someone who smokes from

1241
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:46,038
flower that comes out that's properly

1242
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:50,358
dried and cured has that hard hacking

1243
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:53,520
cough it's just got lots of flavor taste

1244
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:56,358
it's like you can really experience um

1245
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,599
all the nuances of the flavors and

1246
00:56:56,358 --> 00:57:01,558
smells that are you know in the

1247
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,519
description of what that cultivar is and

1248
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,359
well you experience it yourself yeah

1249
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,920
when I remove flow from there you know

1250
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,279
the initial smell isn't too anything too

1251
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,039
crazy but then when you put it in the

1252
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,920
grinder it really you know like you

1253
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,720
mentioned being being locked in there

1254
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,000
and then unlocked kind of as you put it

1255
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:21,480
through the grinder it definitely

1256
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,079
releases a lot of uh a lot of loud smell

1257
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:28,760
those are the tpin that locked in the

1258
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:31,720
tricomes Y and we do get complaints that

1259
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,839
the flower doesn't have as much smell

1260
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:36,759
when it comes out and it's like that's

1261
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:39,480
right because all the tpin are still

1262
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,799
sealed in there break it open or grind

1263
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,960
it and typically the response we get is

1264
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,880
oh

1265
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,079
my yeah I mean I think that's one of the

1266
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,358
biggest misconceptions is like when

1267
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,760
somebody's just has their flower in a

1268
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,440
bag for example and they open I'm like

1269
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,160
this stuff stinks this is this is

1270
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,119
fantastic it's like is it great that

1271
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:01,679
you're smelling all that right this

1272
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,680
second because it's all volatized and

1273
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:08,480
it's now in the air it's not in the

1274
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:10,798
flower so yes it is nice in in in uh it

1275
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,440
is nice to get that smell But realize

1276
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:15,079
that there's actually a loss happening

1277
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,798
into the air we we experience it at Big

1278
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:18,640
commercial we'll go to a big commercial

1279
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,960
grow and when you're half a block away

1280
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:24,159
and you smell it you go pick of problems

1281
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,920
there so how does the final product

1282
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:31,838
compare to freeze dry it's completely

1283
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:35,119
different um as far as the texture you

1284
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,239
know uh Breeze dry you just turns to

1285
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,400
dust in your fingers when you try and

1286
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:42,558
when you're trying to roll with it um

1287
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,400
powder versus something that's got some

1288
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:50,119
nice springy texture sticky texture to

1289
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:54,480
it um as far as the smoke um it I find

1290
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:56,358
freeze dried to be harsh um compared to

1291
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,838
you know something that's dried in C

1292
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:02,920
with the cool cure that's my personal

1293
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:06,358
preference um and if you are looking at

1294
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,240
weight um when you freeze dry you're

1295
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:11,880
getting rid of all the water all your

1296
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,239
weight so if you're in in the business

1297
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,318
um it's not a good bottom line I agree

1298
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,078
yeah I think there's a big difference

1299
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:19,759
between the two I actually got my hands

1300
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:22,920
on some free freeze-dried product last

1301
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:26,119
week and uh for the first time and it's

1302
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,599
great in bowls and bongs but when you're

1303
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:32,720
rolling it and you know a joint or a

1304
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,680
blunt it's like not anywhere good as

1305
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:37,798
just stuff that's been in the canol for

1306
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,838
example or or dried in a grow tent um

1307
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:43,559
big big difference there so when people

1308
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:46,159
say that is freeze drying is the future

1309
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:49,240
I can't agree with that because I I feel

1310
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:51,159
like it's not good for all methods of

1311
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,919
consumption there there are great

1312
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:55,719
applications for it I don't believe

1313
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,119
smokable flower is one of them and one

1314
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:59,558
thing reminds me I wanted to touch upon

1315
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:00,880
is the actual final product you

1316
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:02,440
mentioned before but I forgot to mention

1317
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,760
it is when you mentioned fluffy I just

1318
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:08,358
want to clarify that it's not Airy like

1319
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,160
the buds aren't always Airy uh I know a

1320
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:12,279
lot of folks go after density and the

1321
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,679
density is definitely still maintained

1322
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,359
so I just want to clarify that in case

1323
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:18,118
anybody anybody uh took that the wrong

1324
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:21,960
way I think the fluffy has to do when

1325
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:24,640
you squeeze it it Springs back a little

1326
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,199
bit versus

1327
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,598
crumbling got it yeah makes sense makes

1328
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,519
sense yeah the freeze-dried stuff just

1329
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:32,480
just crumbles right up big difference so

1330
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:34,480
talking about the future of the cool

1331
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,079
cure are there any new features coming

1332
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,920
out in the future for that at at this

1333
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:42,240
time no um you know since a lot of it is

1334
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,200
basic

1335
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:48,279
physics um you know we're just working

1336
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:50,000
on basic physics so this you know

1337
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,760
technically there's not a whole lot we

1338
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,358
can do there um and as far as things in

1339
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:59,280
the future we're always pondering it but

1340
01:00:56,358 --> 01:01:01,358
nothing at this time you know to uh to

1341
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,400
talk about okay and then I got to ask

1342
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,358
because it is one of the biggest

1343
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,160
complaints the price is many claim that

1344
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,880
the price is too high will there be a

1345
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:12,038
price drop at any point in the future uh

1346
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,440
there's none that we anticipate you know

1347
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:16,559
we've cut out what we can part you know

1348
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,119
we discussed early we're buying an

1349
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,280
insulated box with a door that was

1350
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,559
destined to be a wine cooler to get the

1351
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,039
price as low as possible for that

1352
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,559
component um and then the rest of it is

1353
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:32,720
the electronics um and then it's built

1354
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:35,839
all here in Vermont in the United States

1355
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:39,279
we have an amazing staff uh they get

1356
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:43,000
paid vacations they got a 401k they got

1357
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,559
health insurance um and they cost money

1358
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,639
to treat people well and that's what we

1359
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:50,400
believe in and you know yeah could we go

1360
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:53,440
and uh have this whole thing made in

1361
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,440
China uh people who are you know barely

1362
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,200
scraping by for labor that's not what we

1363
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,079
believe in understood yeah a lot of

1364
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,199
people do want to support American

1365
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:04,720
manufacturing American assembly and buy

1366
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:06,598
America and sometimes that does result

1367
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,278
in the price being a little bit higher

1368
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:11,200
but uh you're paying for the workforce

1369
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:12,679
you know you're really employing people

1370
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,759
so yeah there there's a bigger picture

1371
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:17,480
there yep and that's that we're firm

1372
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,559
Believers in it that we were just just

1373
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,119
listed as one of the best uh businesses

1374
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:25,960
companies to work for in the state of

1375
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,720
Vermont W that's awesome congratulations

1376
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,199
