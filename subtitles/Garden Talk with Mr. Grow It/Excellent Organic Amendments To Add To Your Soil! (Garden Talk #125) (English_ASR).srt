121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,560
potential that's awesome yeah I have uh

122

awesome just so easy to use just one

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,639
scoop per plant and then uh do it a

127
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,960
couple times throughout the grow water

128
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,560
only from there on out and plants are

129
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,079

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,240
best way to amend your garden is through

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,880
a soil test so if you have the ability

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,038
to get a soil test and then get a

169
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,159
specific recommendation we can add back

170
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:24,399
in the exact fertility that was removed

171
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,520
when you harvested your plant um and

172
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,638
that that's what I just did in my garden

173
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,240
that's sort of what the whole idea with

174
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,680
a nutrient pack is if you can't soil

175
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,160
test then the idea is then you can we

176
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,800
can get you we can give you get you

177
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,639
close based on adding a general amount

178
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,160
of fertility overall back into the soil

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,360
but then there's all these specific

180
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,880
amendments and they all do different

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,038
things and have different benefits and

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,959
that's really what I think we're going

183
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,519
to talk about today and and to start

184
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,478
with with uh organic maled barley so

185
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,120
this this actually dates back to

186
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,560
Clackamus cot and it's something that he

187
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,598
came up with uh with the idea being

188
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,319
borrowed from the beer industry that

189
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:02,399
malting bar

190
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,598
freezes barley sort of at its highest

191
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,318
enzymatic levels and because of the

192
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,680
enzymes in the seed itself these enzymes

193
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,520
are things that enzymes are just things

194
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,840
that speed up uh chemical reactions and

195
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,918
so um what the idea was by adding malted

196
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,038
barley is you're speeding up a lot of

197
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,560
the uh natural plant processes and

198
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,639
reactions and so you would take the

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,199
malti barley you would grind it up um

200
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,720
apply it to your soil and then water it

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,800
it and that was part of uh something C

202
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,680
came up with as a way of um getting

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,160
better health and growth now I've done

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,319
this a couple times I've done I did a

205
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,360
trial in my tomato garden uh when I had

206
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,360
the farm and I didn't see an a

207
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,000
statistical difference on my plants

208
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,960
there so it's not something that I

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,038
utilize on a regular basis but we do

210
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,959
offer it a lot of people love it I've

211
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,959
heard many people say their plants just

212
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,399
exploded after trying it so in some way

213
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,680
it must have been addressing some

214
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,758
limiting a factor of growth in those in

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,439
those scenarios so I'm I'm not here to

216
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,759
say it doesn't work I'm just saying for

217
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,399
me it didn't I didn't get the results I

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
wanted but I think it's um it's

219
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,120
definitely worth trying in your garden

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,079
that's an input that I haven't tried yet

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,439
myself I've heard a lot about it it is

222
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,639
one of those things that are really

223
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,360
optional right like you don't have to

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,840
add it in order to get through the grow

225
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,680
but it is something that could certainly

226
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,279
add have some benefits at least it is

227
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,840
said to have some benefits so I'll have

228
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,758
to give it a try in the future these

229
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,560
next few that we have on the list here

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,080
are kind of similar so we probably talk

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,958
about at the same time which is a a

232
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,759
compost it's a fungal compost and then

233
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,799
there's also fish compost I thought it'd

234
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,000
be a good opportunity to kind of talk

235
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,599
about compost overall and the

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,200
differences between the two yeah so

237
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,839
compost is a is a whole podcast in of

238
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,360
itself uh making the compost determining

239
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,839
the quality of the compost it can vary

240
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,200
dramatically depending on what the

241
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,279
original feed stocks were how the

242
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
material was actually compost was it was

243
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,720
it thermophilically compost meaning I

244
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,120
killed all the weed seeds and all the

245
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,240
pathogens uh was it processed long

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
enough that the nitrogen cycled there

247
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,680
there's a lot of things that go into

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
this so uh just be aware I guess the big

249
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,278
takeaway is that not all composts are

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,278
created equal you want to Source a high

251
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:22,559
quality one in general composts tend to

252
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:24,958
be lower in fungi than bacteria and so

253
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,838
you know we call ours a fungal compost

254
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,199
um for one of the ones on our on our

255
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,720
website because we're adding food

256
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,320
sources to feed F fungi to get a more

257
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,160
balanced ratio there that being said

258
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,920
um really just make sure that your

259
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,480
source of compost is clean because

260
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:46,278
compost is going to be your your biggest

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,039
contaminant in your grow in terms of um

262
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:53,720
heavy metals and in terms of pests and

263
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,799
pathogens so pretty much all Pest and

264
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,759
pathogens can be avoided in compost if

265
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,958
it's properly thermophilically composted

266
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,799
with the exception of fungus Nats uh

267
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,599
anytime you bring organic matter like

268
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,199
compost into your grow space you're

269
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
potentially adding fungus snats so it's

270
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,160
always a good idea to have a plan for

271
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,079
that like bti or um I SF nematodes

272
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,559
something something along those lines so

273
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,958
when a consumer is looking to purchase

274
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,639
some compost you said look for a high

275
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,518
quality one is there something like in

276
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,000
the product listing that they can like

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
look at look for I should say to

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,720
identify whether or not it is a quality

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,200
compost yeah it's a little bit

280
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,839
complicated there are you every compost

281
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,278
manufacturer should be able to provide

282
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,360
you with a chemical analysis of their

283
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,559
product which um they're required by a

284
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,399
lot of have just to sell as a commercial

285
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,399
compost and that'll tell you some key

286
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,039
information like C to n ratio that

287
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,919
carbon to nitrogen ratio uh to show you

288
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,000
that that material is fully composted

289
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,278
that it's free of pathogens uh they'll

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
have that testing what they don't really

291
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,159
have for you which I think is also

292
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,040
important is sort of what are the

293
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,199
physical properties of that compost so

294
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,759
how much large particulate is in it how

295
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,278
well screened is it because that can

296
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,159
affect the physical properties of your

297
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,240
soil when you add it and then the other

298
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:11,159
thing is the biological properties of

299
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,839
that compost this is this is a time when

300
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,639
I like to break out the microscope and

301
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,800
uh throw the compost under there and

302
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,879
just make sure that I'm seeing all sets

303
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,719
of functional microorganisms in decent

304
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,000
quantities and that's really the best

305
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
way to do it is sort of all three of

306
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
those things um and then do a

307
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,399
germination test as well uh if you're

308
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,200
not going to do all that then you really

309
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,839
have to rely on the manufacturer or the

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,360
supplier to be giving you accurate

311
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,360
information or that you trust that what

312
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
they're providing is going to be good um

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,240
or maybe a buddies or things that have

314
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,159
tried it but but keep in mind with every

315
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,959
compost that you add or even compost

316
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:50,799
extract or compost tea you're adding uh

317
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,518
some fertility usually nitrogen and

318
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,479
potassium and you want to account for

319
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,759
that in your re amending process so you

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,278
don't overdo it you mentioned a

321
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,720
germination test can you kind of go into

322
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,439
a little bit of detail what you mean by

323
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,839
that yeah you can just throw some seeds

324
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,079
in there uh you know radishes are a good

325
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,680
option A lot of times um because I think

326
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,439
they're fairly sensitive to herbicides

327
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,278
so just some some cheap seeds is a way

328
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
to see if the if the plants are able to

329
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,240
grow in it um usually the compost

330
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
manufacturer will have germination tests

331
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
on their

332
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,759
um on their analysis that they can send

333
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,600
you so that it'll show you know we had

334
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,198
96% germination in this that so you know

335
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,879
that there's no um residual herbicides

336
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,000
or anything else from that compost

337
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:38,759
Source cuz some composts are made from

338
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,839
different manur or commercially um

339
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,799
collected yard waste and so there are

340
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,600
sources of contaminants that could be

341
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,799
potentially an issue in your garden

342
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
depending on where you're sourcing it

343
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,719
from that makes sense and you said not

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,680
all compost is created equal would you

345
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,879
also say that as far as the application

346
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,439
rates you know how much to apply how

347
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,198
often to apply is there any general

348
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
guidance amongst all composts or do you

349
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,240
have to kind of look at the packaging

350
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,319
and get the manufacturer's

351
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,039
recommendation so if we're talking about

352
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,920
making a soil from

353
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,958
scratch uh one of the most

354
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,639
popular formulations is this Cornell mix

355
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,119
which is a third a third a third so

356
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,519
that's a third Pete Moss a third Iration

357
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,480
like perter pmus and then a third

358
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,959
compost now I personally like to use

359
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,440
less compost than that I'll use compost

360
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:33,000
in most of my commercial mixes around

361
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,440
15% of my total media um and then once

362
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,440
that soil is established and I go to

363
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,120
reimen I will rarely add compost mostly

364
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,000
because I don't want additional

365
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,959
contamination specifically I don't want

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
to have to deal with with fungus Nets

367
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,119
and I also want to risk bringing any

368
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,560
more heavy metals into the scene so I

369
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,480
tend to not add compost every cycle but

370
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,000
a lot of folks do and get really good

371
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,120
results too so I'm not here to say that

372
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,480
doesn't work um but you just need to be

373
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,120
thoughtful about your application rates

374
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,079
um once that soil is in place you know

375
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,720
and you and you're running I wouldn't

376
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:08,838
add more than a cubic foot per yard of

377
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
of total compost every cycle that would

378
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,680
be the max I would I would want to add

379
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,518
okay that's good to know moving on down

380
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,319
the list we've got biochar next can you

381
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,720
talk to us about biochar yeah biochar is

382
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,000
amazing I I became a Believer when I

383
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,000
visited a facility and the only

384
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,679
difference between the two soils um they

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,278
were using our water only soil and then

386
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,599
we made a a formulation adding in 8%

387
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,679
biochar by volume they were getting

388
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,839
about 8 or 9% better growth and yield

389
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,319
with the addition of biochar and like

390
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,480
compost not all biochar is created equal

391
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,120
um there's a big difference between

392
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,320
biochar and charcoal so you do have to

393
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,000
do a little research but um by using

394
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,920
biochar you're getting uh the the

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,440
nutrients are going to be better

396
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,719
retained heavy metals are going to be

397
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,160
less available you're going to get

398
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,639
better water retention uh and just we

399
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,799
see better overall health and growth

400
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,000
with the plants um I'm not sure that I

401
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,479
fully understand it at this point either

402
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,078
at least why we're getting such a

403
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,839
dramatic response for it from it uh you

404
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,399
do need to charge the biochar but if

405
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,920
you're mixing your soil you can just add

406
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
raw biochar at that point in time

407
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,360
there's enough nitrogen and other

408
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,360
nutrients in there that is not an issue

409
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,600
but I definitely recommend if you have a

410
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
soil mix that does not have biochar and

411
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,879
adding it in at a rate of five to 8% of

412
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,318
your total volume uh can really make a

413
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,240
big difference in your overall plant

414
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,838
health biochar is something I've added

415
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,079
into my soil here and there haven't

416
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,839
really been calculated approach to be

417
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,879
honest with you but I need to kind of

418
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,279
circle back around to it and make sure

419
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,318
I'm using it correctly you know what I

420
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:44,000
mean because I don't want to use too

421
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,759
much don't want to use too little I feel

422
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,120
like uh it's got to kind of be the right

423
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,120
amount in order to kind of see an impact

424
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,519
from it right yeah it's a pretty safe

425
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,639
amendment to add the one thing to be

426
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,919
aware of is it can alter your pH it

427
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,560
tends to be alkaline so you just want to

428
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,679
make sure that your pH isn't creeping up

429
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,159
too high to pull you out of it effective

430
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,758
nutrient uptake range okay something to

431
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,360
keep an eye on next on list I have worm

432
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,000
castings now in particular African

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,759
Nightcrawler worm casting which is on

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,440
your website and it really made me think

435
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,079
of there are different types of worm

436
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,440
castings and we don't really talk about

437
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,679
that much right so worm castings I think

438
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,839
a lot of my audience is familiar with

439
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,719
the benefits of It kind of how to use it

440
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
but if you can break that down for us

441
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,480
and also kind of the differences between

442
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,839
like you know African Nightcrawler worm

443
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,600
casting versus other types Yeah so

444
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,720
basically the African is just the type

445
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,278
of worm that is used in this system It's

446
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,639
a larger worm larger poop uh so it looks

447
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:42,318
really nice and um I really like the

448
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,278
African one that we carry but there's

449
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,799
nothing I'm not here to say that like

450
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:50,559
African worm castings are going to be

451
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,958
superior to um red wigler worm castings

452
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,599
for example it's really the the most

453
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,638
important factors with worm castings are

454
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,040
the feed stock so what the worms are fed

455
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,879
the quality of that how long the worm

456
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,919
work that material so when you look at

457
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,480
worm castings and it's easier with

458
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,759
African because they make bigger poop

459
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,480
but what you should see is a bunch of

460
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,119
tiny balls if you're seeing a bunch of

461
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,038
other stuff in there that means that the

462
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,719
worms haven't worked that material fully

463
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,640
so that's the biggest factor in terms of

464
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,078
uh getting pure castings and getting

465
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,360
your money's worth we used to sell a red

466
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,399
wiggler casting but what we found over

467
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:29,199
time was this particular Source was um

468
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,559
higher chlorides in and sodium in the in

469
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,440
the final product that we want because

470
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,798
we're always testing these things and so

471
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,160
we stopped selling that one but uh prior

472
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,319
to that from a biological perspective

473
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,720
the the African looked just as good as

474
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,720
the red wigler but the chlorides and

475
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,160
sodium were much higher than the red

476
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,759
wiggler so we dropped it so just be sure

477
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,880
to you know look into your sources and

478
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,359
make sure you're adding things because

479
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,400
when when you get too high of sodium or

480
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,038
chlorides in your soil both of those

481
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,480
things can cause issues with your EC and

482
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,839
limit available nutrient uptake for your

483
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,679
plant yeah too much sodium can certainly

484
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,678
inhibit some of the other nutrient being

485
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,679
upt and that's a problem I ran into I

486
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:08,400
have high sodium I water high sodium

487
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,240
bicarbonates and so when I tried using

488
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,600
tap water here it just it was a terrible

489
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
result I had deficiencies unfortunately

490
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,879
a whole bunch of crap was going on in

491
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,759
the medium there it was uh not a good

492
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,640
result at all so that's interesting that

493
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,519
that was in the worm castings though

494
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,440
yeah yeah water is the most important

495
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,240
thing I Wherever Whenever I move to a

496
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,400
new location the first thing I do is

497
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,120
test my water and make sure that it's

498
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,759
suitable for irrigation because what you

499
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,158
can drink is not necessarily what you

500
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,720
want to put put into your soil or put on

501
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,159
your plants so that's a really good

502
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,798
point I'm sorry you're dealing with that

503
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,760
and in regards to application rate now

504
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,960
is this more generalized versus the

505
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,960
different types of wor I'm castings like

506
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,880
typically what I'll do is uh you know

507
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,600
either cup or I'll do like an inch

508
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,760
across the top layer of the soil is

509
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,079
there certain application rate or

510
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,839
General application rate that you advise

511
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:01,038
folks to use for warm castings no so the

512
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,240
way I approach worm castings is really

513
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,720
because they're so expensive it and we

514
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,120
don't have we usually have limited

515
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,960
access to them because of the cost um I

516
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,558
tend to use them specifically for

517
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,480
biology so I will use them like you said

518
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:15,599
with a light top dressing or I'll make a

519
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,480
compost extract or compost tea out of

520
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,959
them and irated compost tea is a way of

521
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,720
extracting and replicating those

522
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,279
microorganisms so uh I think those are

523
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,679
the best ways to get the most Bang from

524
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,918
your buck from earthworm castings good

525
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,640
to know next on the list is kiss

526
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,640
Organics microbe Catalyst talk to us

527
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,120
about that sure yeah so

528
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,840
this this product specifically was

529
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,959
something that uh we discovered worked

530
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:44,359
really well as a as a diversified food

531
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,400
source for making compost tea so we

532
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,319
called it a microb catalyst because it

533
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,159
it speeds up the microbial reproduction

534
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,879
in your tea and it's easier to use than

535
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,640
uh sticky liquid like um unsulfured

536
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,480
blackstrap molasses for example so yeah

537
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,759
we have rates and recommend for people

538
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,319
to use that as a sort of a a compost te

539
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,240
food source and that's that's primarily

540
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,720
what we sell to folks for that's awesome

541
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,319
I wasn't familiar with that product at

542
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
all I'm going to have to pick some up it

543
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,759
seems uh seemed interesting to use that

544
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
so you basically use it in replacement

545
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,720
to like a molasses that you would the

546
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,798
same dosage that you would with a tea or

547
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,839
what yeah so in a five gallon Brew for

548
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,519
example you would add a half a cup of

549
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,798
the micro Catalyst and a tablespoon of

550
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,599
the alphalpha of organic alphalpha meal

551
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,720
and that would be all the food that your

552
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,959
microbes would need for that 24hour to

553
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,679
36-hour brew cycle um in addition to the

554
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,000
compost that you're adding um and that's

555
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,480
that's really all you need it makes it

556
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,440
really easy and it's just uh it's it's

557
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,599
it's affordable and clean the Molasses

558
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,798
works great too it's just kind of sticky

559
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,798
and messy and um that's the only reason

560
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,038
that we uh we form it's hard to ship

561
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,960
molasses too so we we thought adding a

562
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,599
more Diversified food source we see we

563
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,798
tend to see really really good results

564
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,240
under the microscope using that as a as

565
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:04,839
a feed stock that's awesome I'm

566
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,319
definitely going to have to try that out

567
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,839
let's uh we're on a roll here let's just

568
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,200
keep on going we got that neem cake

569
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,798
pellets next on the list yeah so

570
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,880
neem the neem cake comes from the neem

571
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,240
tree it's a the neem uh it's also called

572
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,400
neem seed meal essentially what it is

573
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,880
it's the Pressed version of the seeds

574
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,880
it's what's left after they extract the

575
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,720
oil so it's still going to have some as

576
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
a dra in percentage it's going to vary

577
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
depending on your source and how well

578
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,599
that material was pressed and um it it's

579
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,400
got an NPK value that's fairly good I

580
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,199
tend to not use neem as much anymore

581
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,278
when I first started out with Clackamus

582
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,480
cot uh NE was one of his must must use

583
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,960
amendments and so we we added it to our

584
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,919
mixes and I was using it in CO's mix at

585
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,960
the time and and we still offer it but

586
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,919
I've I've dialed it back for a couple

587
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,200
reasons one is sort of the ecological

588
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,080
impact of shipping a product all the way

589
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,840
from India to here because it's they're

590
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,879
not grown here it's grown in India so we

591
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,599
have to get that fertilizer here I just

592
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,600
think there's sources that offer us

593
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,759
similar nutrient values that can be

594
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,798
sourced more locally or

595
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:19,200
sustainably second and this is more of

596
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:21,240
an issue with the oils but we did uh one

597
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
of the a good friends of mine was

598
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,880
working with a farm in Oregon and they

599
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,639
actually failed for a chemistry of

600
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,320
pesticide that hasn't been used in the

601
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,080
United States since since the 70s it's

602
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,519
been banned and essentially what

603
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,960
happened was that pesticide had been

604
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,960
sprayed on the neem tree and then

605
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,640
pressed into the concentrated into the

606
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,919
oil and then when the when the farmer

607
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,679
here used that oil he ended up failing

608
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,759
uh when he submitted his final flower

609
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
for testing and so this this is this is

610
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,599
a rare occurrence I don't think this is

611
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,519
this is something to necessarily be

612
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,319
afraid of but it is a a potential source

613
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,519
of contamination and we try to limit

614
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,839
those as much as possible so um I I just

615
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,240
think there's other options that we can

616
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,798
turn to that are a little safer um that

617
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,480
work just as well wow since the70s it

618
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,679
was a a long time ago that's uh that's

619
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,000
very surprising very surprising result

620
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
well yeah so it was obvious that the the

621
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,359
farmer the medicinal plant farmer hadn't

622
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,359
been spraying this product cuz they

623
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,959
wouldn't even able to Source it but the

624
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,759
fact that it was there in Trace Amounts

625
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,200
on their plant they traced it back to

626
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,519
this oil and then the oil got traced all

627
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,840
the way back to India where they they

628
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,599
figured it out essentially and

629
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,879
realistically the person who was selling

630
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,439
the neem oil didn't realize that the

631
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,640
product had been contaminated either um

632
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,720
because they thought they were sourcing

633
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,480
a clean source as well so when we're

634
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,880
getting things internationally there's a

635
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,880
certain level of trust that uh we're

636
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,720
having to put in terms of how that

637
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,080
product is produced I mean it's it's

638
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,000
worse for our food frankly but it's just

639
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,960
something to be aware of great Point

640
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,919
next up we've got humic acid powder talk

641
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,038
to us about that yeah so humic acids are

642
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,320
uh derived typically from leonardite

643
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:10,158
it's a minded product it's very good at

644
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:13,200
chelation um this humic acid powder is

645
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,760
going to have uh some level of fulvic

646
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,960
the humic and fulvic it just relates to

647
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,640
the size of the molecule itself um so

648
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,360
it's a great carbon-based input that you

649
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,720
can use when you are doing a folar

650
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,359
application or even a light soil drench

651
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,558
when you're applying other products so

652
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,439
it's sort of like U uh it's I put in the

653
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,678
category of things like surfactants that

654
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,120
you would add to a to a product when you

655
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,880
go to apply it just to get a little

656
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:42,759
better efficacy out of the product

657
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,320
itself you mentioned the word cation and

658
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,640
I do have a mixed audience here some are

659
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,720
beginners intermediate some are Advanced

660
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,759
some know what cation is some don't do

661
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,159
you mind taking a second here to explain

662
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,119
what cation is yeah cation is just a

663
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,960
fancy word for bonds width so

664
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,398
essentially what it does is bonds with

665
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,000
and makes these uh minerals or your

666
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:07,678
fertilizer application a little easier

667
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,798
for the plant to um to access the

668
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,919
nutrients in your application and is it

669
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,200
is it heavy metals usually that kind of

670
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,520
bind to that keyate easier I'm speaking

671
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,679
a little bit above my head here I'm not

672
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,038
crazy into chemistry here but from my

673
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,559
understanding something like iron for

674
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,079
example is uh can be chelated and kept

675
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,918
in that form so the plant can be uptaken

676
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,079
when the ballpark there or what yeah

677
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,440
Iron's a tricky one because uh it

678
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:40,359
oxidizes so rapidly when exposed to

679
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,038
oxygen it um it changes form but um I I

680
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,439
so I feel like a broker record bringing

681
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,000
up heavy metals what my my thought was

682
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,640
in relation to humic acid is just

683
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,679
realize it can be another potential

684
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,720
source of heavy metals because it is a

685
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,480
mined product and I have seen uh it come

686
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,038
back with higher levels of lead you're

687
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,839
using such a tiny amount of it it's

688
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,119
probably not a large risk I mean you're

689
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,480
we're talking like an eighth of a

690
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,239
teaspoon per gallon of water but still

691
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,159
it's just something heavy metals has

692
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,720
been a bigger topic for a lot of Growers

693
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,520
because of uh regulations around around

694
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,278
growing and so we just try to limit as

695
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,599
much as possible and for our own

696
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:20,079
personal health too even if I'm growing

697
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,879
plants medically I want to make sure

698
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,519
that I'm I'm growing the cleanest

699
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,960
possible product that I can you really

700
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,200
bring up a great point with the heavy

701
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,200
metals I think that's off of a lot of

702
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,159
people's radar you know they're not even

703
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,840
looking at that but it is a concern and

704
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,960
it it can be a concern with all natural

705
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,599
inputs as well uh some people think oh

706
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,480
it's just just a synthetic stuff that

707
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,079
you got to worry about heavy metals no

708
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,399
no there's all natural inputs can

709
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,759
absolutely have he heavy metals included

710
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:48,798
in there as well and we actually had uh

711
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,158
we covered it quite a bit in our last

712
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,398
talk so I want to reference people over

713
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,520
to that last talk that we had because

714
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:56,879
you went on for several minutes just

715
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,879
talking about heavy metals how to check

716
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,840
for them things to look out for so on

717
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
and so forth so check that last episode

718
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,119
we did together if you want to learn

719
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,480
more about heavy metals next on the list

720
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,000
we have coconut water powder yeah so

721
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,399
this is another one that has to get

722
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,359
credited back to Clackamus cot back in

723
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:17,000
the day the the idea there is that a

724
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,240
seed has all the nutrients that it needs

725
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,798
to grow you don't need to add fertilizer

726
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,960
to get a seed to germinate uh so those

727
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,798
initial stages everything it needs is

728
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,519
inside the seed itself and so coconuts

729
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:33,398
are the largest seed seeds that you can

730
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,558
get so by taking the water out of the

731
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:37,558
coconut what we're getting is all of

732
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,240
those enzymes and nutrients that a plant

733
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,798
needs to start its life and so what

734
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,919
folks have done is essentially taken

735
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,960
that coconut water uh or the coconut

736
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,600
water powder which is just a dehydrated

737
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,798
form of that's more concentrated so it's

738
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,558
more affordable and then um applying

739
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,918
that to their plants is a way of getting

740
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,839
plants some more essential enzymes and

741
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,840
and

742
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,398
nutrients uh again it's not something

743
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,079
that I recommend on the regular uh but

744
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,879
we do offer it and a lot of people

745
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,079
really like to use it I don't think it

746
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,159
makes sense

747
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,558
commercially just due to the cost

748
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,640
associated with it um we really try to

749
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,798
limit inputs on a commercial scale uh

750
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,880
because it's all revenue driven and

751
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,480
we're trying to create the simplest you

752
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
know least number of touches to get the

753
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,679
maximal result that we can but for a hom

754
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,240
grower I think things like the Mal

755
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,399
malted barley and the coconut water

756
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,720
powder are absolutely worth

757
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,879
experimenting with and see what kind of

758
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,120
results you get in your grow and and if

759
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,799
it's worth using on a regular basis or

760
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,639
if you just don't really see a benefit

761
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,398
that's an input I haven't used just yet

762
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,640
but it was on my list of things to try

763
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,158
in the future so I'll probably be one of

764
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,519
the ones that to experiment with it in

765
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,320
the future awesome next up we have

766
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,480
karanja seed meal let's get into that

767
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,158
yeah karanja seed very similar to neem

768
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,399
and that it's uh it's sourced from India

769
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,760
it's got a little different NPK value

770
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:03,879
than the neem does

771
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:07,240
um I don't have a ton more to add about

772
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,200
it other than when I I did some

773
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,679
microscope work work with it I found

774
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,319
when I so I take compost distilled water

775
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,320
I add a little bit of NE cake for

776
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,960
example to it and I let the microbes um

777
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,359
work it for a while and then see what

778
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,960
happens and with the neem cake we found

779
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:26,798
the microbes actually increased in

780
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,240
biomass uh specifically bacteria seem to

781
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,879
really like it would the cran seed it

782
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,278
actually kind of had an opposite effect

783
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,640
I didn't see a lot of growth microbial

784
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:38,119
growth from adding it which I I thought

785
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
was really interesting I don't know what

786
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,119
that means in terms of the properties of

787
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
the product itself uh we primarily use

788
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,678
it just for a little bit of NPK and I

789
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
know it's something that Clackamus cot

790
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,840
used in his original mixes pretty

791
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,479
straightforward there next up on the

792
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,558
list I have maganese sulfate now I know

793
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,519
a lot of people are familiar with

794
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:00,038
magnesium sulfate but maganese

795
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,120
sulfate a little bit different talk to

796
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,038
us about that yes so very important you

797
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,000
don't confuse the two let's start there

798
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:10,398
because uh mang manganese is very

799
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,640
different than magnesium um if you if

800
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,439
you were to apply manganese sulfate at

801
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,480
the rates you apply magnesium sulfate

802
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,558
you would get in a lot of trouble so

803
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,240
manganese is a uh Trace element that all

804
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,639
plants need it performs a bunch of

805
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,839
different specific plant functions but

806
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,640
you need parts per million of it so you

807
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:32,480
don't need very much and what we found

808
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,200
more recently with our soil testing is

809
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,640
that by that plants are utilizing a fair

810
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,880
amount of Manganese and so we're

811
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:46,600
applying it like I just reeded my my

812
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:50,159
grow base and I applied um two two

813
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:52,119
teaspoons per yard of soil to give you

814
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,480
an idea on a rate and that because I

815
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,678
can't sprinkle that in evenly I add it

816
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,440
to water I dissolve it and then I water

817
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,480
that in and that's going to be all the

818
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,600
manganes requirement I'll need for a

819
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,278
whole cycle just to give you guys idea

820
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:08,079
of how little we're using but um yeah

821
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,278
based on the tissue testing and the soil

822
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:14,000
testing we are seeing some

823
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,200
manganese uh deficiencies or hunger to

824
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,480
that we want to address by just adding a

825
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,919
tiny bit more okay and technically this

826
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,798
is a salt right you got two elements

827
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,480
that are bound together the maganese

828
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:31,119
sulfate it's salt and a lot of people

829
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,240
just ass associate salts with synthetic

830
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,398
however there are all natural salts and

831
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,200
this is one of them right do you know

832
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:41,879
the source of this magnesium sulfate or

833
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,519
I said it wrong there magnes sulfate

834
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,639
yeah so a lot of these products are

835
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,038
mined um and then refined and it's that

836
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,638
refining process that technically uh

837
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,638
people have issue with in terms of the

838
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:57,558
the fact that it is a A sulfate but keep

839
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:01,599
in mind that gypsum is also a sulfate

840
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:03,798
it's calcium sulfate um magnesium

841
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,959
sulfate Epsom salt is also some A

842
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,359
sulfate so all of these things are mind

843
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,480
products um they are approved for use in

844
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:14,240
organic production if you can show a

845
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,000
deficiency on your soil test um so it's

846
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,079
not something that I necessarily shy

847
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,159
away from because it's the easiest way

848
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:24,480
to get targeted available manganese for

849
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,440
my plant but there are other ways you

850
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,480
will get some manganese potentially from

851
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,600
VAR compost sources uh Rock dusts kelp

852
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,399
meal um you're just you're bringing in

853
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,839
other sources other nutrients at the

854
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,798
same time and you're also bringing in

855
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:43,240
more contamination and heavy metals so

856
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,599
uh it's you got to make a choice there

857
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,638
as to what you're comfortable with as a

858
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,558
grower using using in your grow and

859
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:51,439
honestly if you didn't use manganese you

860
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,558
probably wouldn't see a visible

861
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,720
difference in your plant but we are

862
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,519
seeing it in the tissue testing that um

863
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
the plant is taking it up and is

864
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,240
utilizing it that's interesting it's

865
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,240
good to know next up we have aisel 16h

866
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,000
which is a potassium silicate talk to us

867
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,440
all about that what are the benefits

868
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,319
application rate so on and so forth yeah

869
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,440
so many people are familiar with uh a

870
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:19,240
lot of the silica products on the market

871
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,278
like uh Silica Blast or din gr protect

872
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,759
things like that the Exel 16h is just a

873
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:27,839
dried powder that allows you to make

874
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,158
your own liquid silica by adding your

875
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,398
own water so you're not paying for them

876
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,639
to ship water so you end up with about a

877
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:38,199
gallon a pound will equivalate to about

878
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:42,278
a gallon of uh din gr protect in terms

879
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,440
of the ratios and similar to you know

880
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:46,200
these other products that we've talked

881
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,919
about it is uh approved for use in

882
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,000
organic production as a foler

883
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,720
application for IPM but it's not allowed

884
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,798
for uh soil drenches and other uses for

885
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,278
fertility so it is not uh fully organic

886
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,079
but it is allowed for use in organic

887
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:05,159
production so people do your research

888
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:10,039
depending on how you feel about that but

889
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,838
silica is amazing it helps with uh uh

890
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:15,159
stem strength it helps with drought

891
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:19,000
resistance heat resistance uh pretty

892
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:21,878
much all forms of abiotic stress it

893
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,480
mitigates microt toxicities of uh

894
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:26,480
micronutrients in your Leaf by spreading

895
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,079
that out more evenly so you don't end up

896
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,800
with um toxicity issues it's uh it it

897
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,720
has so many benefits I did a whole

898
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,280
podcast with Dr Wendy zelner just

899
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,559
talking about silica and I learned a ton

900
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,280
it it's it really should be an essential

901
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,440
mineral and if the soil if your soil is

902
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,879
deficient in silica you will actually

903
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,960
see higher uptake of heavy metals so

904
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,199
getting that silica in there actually

905
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,519
helps mitigate heavy metal issues too so

906
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:58,118
it really is a wondrous Amendment and

907
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:02,280
there are other sources of silicon that

908
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,119
you can get they um they they just are

909
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,560
may not be quite as available but some

910
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,440
other options for folks are dious Earth

911
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,799
is another one um there's biogenic

912
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,358
sources which just means it's plant

913
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,920
derived from things like bamboo or rice

914
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:21,880
um and then lastly the least available

915
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,358
form uh is is quartz or things like

916
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,160
silica sand those I tend to shy away

917
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,119
from just because they may not be

918
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,279
available within a reasonable time frame

919
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,280
for your grow so adding them you know

920
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400
you may not get a result for months to

921
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,119
years in terms of availability

922
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,800
but yeah I I think people should do a

923
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,880
deep dive on silica and really consider

924
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,839
utilizing it in your grow next up on the

925
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,960
list we have borax this is something I

926
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:51,119
haven't really heard of people using

927
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,838
talk to us what is it and how do you go

928
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,119
about using this in your garden yeah so

929
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,799
borax is is a source of boron you want

930
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,240
to be really careful with it it's a a

931
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,200
trace mineral like manganese but you're

932
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,318
we're talking you know just a few parts

933
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:08,719
per million and so uh I would only

934
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:11,960
suggest that Growers use Boron or Borax

935
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:14,399
if you are uh if you have a soil test

936
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,920
and you are low on that test and you can

937
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,318
to add just a tiny amount you would mix

938
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,800
it with water and water it in to your

939
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,079
soil but if you don't have a soil test I

940
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,640
would not even mess with it um

941
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,480
interestingly enough you can pick it up

942
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,879
at your locally local grocery store

943
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,519
because it's the same stuff people used

944
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,200
to wash their clothes uh so it's kind of

945
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,800
that's kind of fun but uh just be

946
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:35,239
careful very very careful with it

947
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,119
because you can absolutely make your

948
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,039
soil uh toxic and cause a lot of issues

949
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,838
for your plants that's where I heard her

950
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,400
from it's a grocery store but I had no

951
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,119
idea that it was actually able to be

952
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,680
used in the garden that's interesting

953
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,079
yeah yeah kind of fun there's a few

954
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,559
things like that is the next thing

955
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,000
something like that corn gluten

956
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,119
meal so corn corn gluten meal it's a

957
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,639
byproduct of uh

958
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,599
corn the egg industry and essentially

959
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,879
what they found you'll see it in a lot

960
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,280
of products as a weed preventor so it's

961
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,559
a pre-emergent so you can use it to

962
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,599
deter germination in something like your

963
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,679
lawn if applied at the right time in the

964
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,240
spring other than that it's primarily

965
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,078
just a nitrogen Source it's not

966
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,118
something that we uh use a lot of with

967
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,280
our medicinal plants specifically but it

968
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,920
is something that we we do offer for

969
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,200
folks folks but we don't we don't use a

970
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,400
lot of it got it and so everything that

971
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,399
we had just talked about is available on

972
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,000
your website correct me from wrong there

973
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
kiss organics.com one of the things I

974
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,318
wanted to bring up I don't know if you

975
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,800
want to talk about it you sent me a

976
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:46,880
usual suspects chart and I thought this

977
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,640
was pretty interesting here it kind of

978
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,079
breaks down some of the soil amendments

979
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,960
and what you get out of it as far as the

980
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,960
nutrition are you able to talk about

981
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,039
that at all yeah one of uh one of the

982
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
guys that

983
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,318
Brandon Hudson actually kind of came up

984
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,880
with coting the frame the phrase Usual

985
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:06,719
Suspects with the idea that these are

986
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,640
the these are the amendments or

987
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,199
fertilizers that we tend to recommend

988
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,279
over and over again uh either because

989
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,199
they they bring in the specific nutrient

990
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,920
that we want uh they're very clean

991
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,759
they're very affordable they're easily

992
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,039
accessible uh so that list is that's

993
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,599
where that list came from and you can

994
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:26,000
get it actually downloaded from our

995
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,480
website on the soil testing information

996
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,440
page U or if you go to our website you

997
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,000
can also select uh amendments based on

998
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,079
what you're looking for by mineral like

999
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,480
are you looking for nitrogen you can you

1000
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,920
can click on that and see all the things

1001
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,119
that are going to give you nitrogen or

1002
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,760
potassium or phosphorus or if you're

1003
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,599
dealing with a Target pest same kind of

1004
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,000
thing you can click you know Target

1005
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,200
aphids target white flies Target

1006
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,358
spidermites so we tried to make it as

1007
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,598
simple as possible for folks to find

1008
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,400
what the information that they're

1009
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,838
looking for um on the various pages so

1010
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,440
yeah feel free to share that link list

1011
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,880
or I'm happy to talk about any of those

1012
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,720
amendments uh at any point too yeah

1013
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,760
we'll definitely get that list shared

1014
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,559
and if you want to find out more

1015
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,240
information you can contact kiss and uh

1016
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,078
they'll be able to send you this chart

1017
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,000
as well and some additional information

1018
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,200
in regards to it so taking all these

1019
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,960
inputs that we just talked about what

1020
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,799
advice would you have for Growers using

1021
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,559
these inputs for the first time so some

1022
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,680
of the best advice that was ever shared

1023
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,880
with me is

1024
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,199
to if you're just going to go

1025
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,559
go for it as in no soil testing and you

1026
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,759
want to start experimenting with these

1027
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,279
things couple couple piece of advice

1028
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,359
would be sort of a half cup to a cup per

1029
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,680
cubic foot is a good rate if it has a

1030
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:42,679
higher mpk value go with that lower rate

1031
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,000
if it has a lower one like alfalfa meal

1032
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,960
for example you can go with a little bit

1033
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,280
higher rate of like a cup per cubic foot

1034
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,760
and generally you can stay out of

1035
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,319
trouble with something like that if if

1036
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,319
you want a product that's already done

1037
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:58,119
that for you that you can just mix in

1038
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:00,079
you can get there's commercial products

1039
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,480
like our nutrient pack for example where

1040
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,880
we've already kind of done that

1041
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,559
formulation for you it's going to give

1042
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,680
you a wide variety of amendments and you

1043
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,358
can just mix it into your soil you don't

1044
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:11,879
have to go through that process um the

1045
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,880
the last piece of advice I have would be

1046
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,960
if you do have the ability to do a soil

1047
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,838
test uh I absolutely recommend it

1048
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,800
because that's going to tell us exactly

1049
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,599
what is going on with your soil and we

1050
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,200
can then really dial things in specific

1051
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,880
for what your plants are going to need

1052
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,719
so if we know the crop and we know the

1053
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,280
water quality and we know the the

1054
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,838
fertility of the soil we can get we can

1055
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,319
hit whatever targets we're looking for

1056
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,199
um for your particular crop um but

1057
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,800
whatever you do have fun with it I mean

1058
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,439
I I think experimentation is a lot of

1059
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,519
fun and I'm always doing experimenting

1060
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,200
with my plants the one thing I think

1061
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,199
that's important when you do experiment

1062
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:53,519
is to just do change one variable at a

1063
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,000
time so add biochar to half your garden

1064
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,559
don't do anything else differently cuz

1065
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,880
when you start when you start experiment

1066
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:00,880
add five different things it's really

1067
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,519
hard to know what actually made a

1068
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,920
difference and what you're wasting money

1069
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,679
on or what made or maybe one of those

1070
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,240
things actually was antagonistic because

1071
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,838
it added too much potassium or too much

1072
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,759
nitrogen so just change one thing see

1073
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,480
what the results look like and then make

1074
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,160
another decision your next round and and

1075
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,880
go from there I think that's some really

1076
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,719
good advice and one more thing I'd like

1077
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,880
to add to that is you know get some

1078
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,399
viewers tune into this or listen to this

1079
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,200
and they think that they need to go and

1080
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,240
buy every single one of these inputs and

1081
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,159
add it to the Garden they absolutely do

1082
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,439
not need all of these inputs in order to

1083
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:35,679
be successful in the grow actually this

1084
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,838
particular list here you could probably

1085
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,399
get away with not using any of it and

1086
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,318
still be successful in the grow there's

1087
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,720
other inputs that you can add such as a

1088
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,639
kiss org against nutrient pack for

1089
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,279
example you can use just that and get

1090
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,920
through the grow what we've talked about

1091
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,920
today are just additional inputs that

1092
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,318
you can add to potentially get a better

1093
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,440
result in your G better growth higher

1094
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,440
yield quality so on and so forth and so

1095
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,480
I thought that would be um Worthy of

1096
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,400
mentioning here right now because I do

1097
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,000
have some folks that think they need to

1098
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,280
buy everything go out and buy everything

1099
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,358
right now and uh another thing is people

1100
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,319
think that we're just trying to promote

1101
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:12,159
products the whole time and the fact of

1102
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,079
the matter is we don't care what the

1103
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,920
heck you buy go ahead and do it yourself

1104
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,880
we're just here to talk shop reveal some

1105
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,960
information here and uh just have fun

1106
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,280
with it you know enjoy the conversation

1107
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,159
I think some people watch my episode

1108
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,000
sometimes and they're like oh you're

1109
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,279
just trying to push products and it's

1110
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,039
like I don't care what you buy go buy

1111
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,240
what you want I'm just talking products

1112
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,759
and it kind of goes back to the um the

1113
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,159
fact that we're always in social media

1114
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,400
there's always advertisements in front

1115
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:38,719
of us and those advertisements are

1116
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,119
always products so our brain is just

1117
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,799
kind of hardwired to think product

1118
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,519
advertisement you know what I mean so

1119
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,760
just want to clarify that thing that we

1120
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,838
don't care what you buy we just talking

1121
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,599
about the products talking about inputs

1122
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,719
getting Tad's advice on these different

1123
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,720
inputs what he uses how he uses them and

1124
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,838
so on and so forth so appreciate you

1125
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,558
sitting down with us today Tad great

1126
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:02,119
talk I will definitely have a link to

1127
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,920
Ted's Channel down in the YouTube

1128
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,358
description section below if you didn't

1129
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,318
know he has an excellent podcast as well

1130
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,838
more advanced podcast similar to this

1131
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,480
Garden Talk podcast but kind of more

1132
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,880
advanced folks so if you are on the

1133
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,559
advanced side of things and happen to

1134
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,280
not know about his podcast 100%

1135
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,800
recommendation for you to tune into his

1136
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,440
podcast because I tune into it and I

1137
