1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,119
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,528
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,390
and you're watching my extra channel

4
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,210
here I've got the California light works

5
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,739
solar extreme 500 LED grow light in this

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,450
video I'm gonna measure the power output

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,070
I won't be talking about any of the

8
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,048
grill lights features in this video I

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,640
actually recently released a video where

10
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,140
I unbox the unit and talk about some of

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,368
the features I'll link that video in the

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,230
description section below so you can

13
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,018
check it out for the part tests I'll be

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,689
using the Apple gmq 500 power meter this

15
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,509
meter shows measurements and ppfd and it

16
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,969
measures from 389 nanometers to 692

17
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,410
nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers if

18
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,509
this girl light is emitting any light

19
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,339
that's outside of that range it will not

20
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,019
show on this meter and this is really

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,760
just to give you a general idea of what

22
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,739
the power output is for this light it's

23
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,299
not going to be exact I do have this

24
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,640
grow light in a grow tent which has

25
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,349
reflective walls so that could increase

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,119
the numbers I also have the grow tent

27
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,760
door opened so we're not getting the

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,159
reflective on one side I have this light

29
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,780
in a 4 foot by 4 foot grow tent which is

30
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,959
actually the coverage area for this grow

31
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,730
light and I'll be doing two distances 18

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,790
inches away which is for flowering and

33
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,590
24 inches which is for vegetation both

34
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,540
of these distances are recommended by

35
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,310
the manufacturer just like all the other

36
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,719
part test videos that I create I will

37
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,719
let the measurements do the talking

38
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,649

what do you think of these measurements

43
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:54,979
let me know in the comment section below

44
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:56,780
I will leave a link to this grow light

45
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,530
in the description section below and I

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,658
will leave it at that

47
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,799
thank you so much for watching and until

48
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,798
next time face
