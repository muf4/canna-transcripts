00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,600
stairs and this episode is a little bit

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,000
different than any of the other episodes

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,960
on this podcast we're talking gardening

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,159
content creation although this episode

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,878
isn't focused on growing plants I still

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,679
thought it'd be valuable to hear how

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,640
gardening content is created gardening

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,359
channels he watches gardening channels

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,359

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,079

hop right into an introduction tell us

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
about you a little bit about yourself

86
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,519
and how you got into gardening uh well

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,158
uh my name is Big Daddy buds you know I

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
got the channel called the ground of the

89
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,399
stairs of course uh and I'm a content

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,159
creator been doing this for about 18

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,719
years now started on YouTube right along

92
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,239
when YouTube started when there weren't

93
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,919
that many people doing it yet when it

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,039
was kind of weird to do it so uh I made

95
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,719
a living off of this and now I'm trying

96
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,878
to do it over here in this side of the

97
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
garden that's awesome man this episode

98
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,079
is going to be a little bit different

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,439
you know when we were first talking

100
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,040
about things usually what we do is we

101
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,560
talk about Garden fundamental things

102
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,280
that you can do in the garden so the

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,959
folks that are hearing this can

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
potentially take some of those practices

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,759
and Implement their Garden you talked

106
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,679
about how you potentially want to get

107
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,120
into content creation talk about content

108
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,719
creation and at first I was like I don't

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,719
know if this is really going to fly but

110
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,680
I thought about it for a little while

111
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,000
longer and I'm like it's gardening

112
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,599
content creation it totally relates to

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,239
everything this podcast is about you

114
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,919
know you're in the gardening niche

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,480
we can totally get into that in this

116
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,199
episode and I think I think people will

117
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,639
definitely gain some value out of it

118
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,598
something different you said you wanted

119
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,359
something different and so uh yeah glad

120
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,438
to have you on here yeah you know what

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
it is I figured I've seen so much on

122
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,079
your channel and so so many people that

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,680
are educated already uh that have phds

124
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,439
that do this for a living uh and have so

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,639
many different angles to come at uh when

126
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,399
when we talking about this plant that I

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
just felt you know let me bring

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,879
something different to the table what I

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,079
have experienced is my PhD is in content

130
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,839
creation and it has to do with the plant

131
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,519
and it still has to do with how we

132
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,918
distribute information about the plant

133
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,240
that we love so I figured you know let's

134
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,959
bring that to your channel and hopefully

135
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,960
uh give the people a different Viewpoint

136
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,359
of what it is that we do well said and I

137
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,560
think it's going to open up a some eyes

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
too because there's some some things

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,360
behind the scenes as content creators

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,519
that we do that like the viewers don't

141
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,080
really realize like how much work gets

142
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,279
put into it how we are so suppressed and

143
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,120
so on and so so forth so we're going to

144
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,959
get into all that today which which is

145
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,720
really going to be a fun conversation

146
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,799
but how did you how did it all start for

147
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,919
you how did you get into content

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,840
creation I guess something that content

149
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,680
creators all have in common is H the

150
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,038
need to to want to be liked and accepted

151
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,160
and I feel like I had some of that

152
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,719
growing up I also uh have led a kind of

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,840
very interesting life I've done a lot of

154
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,680
things that I think are cool and I've

155
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,799
always wanted to share that with other

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
people so when I was younger I used to

157
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,079
travel a lot that was what my first

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,839
channel was about was about traveling

159
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,399
and showing all these experiences that I

160
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,399
would have I I used to send all these

161
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,918

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
really want to be bothered like that not

167
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,759
everybody's into that type of stuff so I

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,560
started uploading the content to YouTube

169
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,479
and people started following I found an

170
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,160
audience and since then I've been hooked

171
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,519
and you started a long time ago you said

172
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,800
I mean before we even hopped on here

173
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,918
started recording you had mentioned 2006

174
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,038
is you your first YouTube video which is

175
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,758
a very long time ago so pretty

176
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,839
impressive there yeah I had to look back

177
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,840
on mine 2007 was the first one for me I

178
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,079
upload 10 videos in 2007 definitely not

179
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,519
gardening videos you know completely UNR

180
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,598
related me do just doing crap with my

181
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,359
friends but uh it's wild to see like how

182
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:25,918
far it's come and um just thinking back

183
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,800
at all the work that was put into it

184
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,240
it's wild right it's crazy because back

185
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,000
then it wasn't cool to be a YouTuber at

186
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
all it was actually kind of weird you

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,279
know and there was a very small amount

188
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
of people that would even put themselves

189
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,000
out there you know once you put yourself

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,400
on on screen it's like it's there

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,519
forever so back then even 10,000 views

192
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,079
felt like a lot because no one else was

193
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:51,038
doing it you know so I remember those

194
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,758
times were so weird I wanted to be on TV

195
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,598
and now look how things have changed

196
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,319
instead of me wanted to be on TV it

197
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,800
seems like TV people want to be on

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,840
YouTube like U movie stars have their

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,478
own YouTube Channel and this wasn't like

200
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,839
this before it would be kind of weak

201
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,079
even for like a a famous person to have

202
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,000
a YouTube channel back then so the way

203
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,839
that things have shifted uh is is has

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,160
been amazing to me yeah it's been crazy

205
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,679
to have kind of like an open source to

206
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
where anybody can go in there and upload

207
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,360
videos and make it impact get scen and

208
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,079
so on and so forth versus uh you know

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,479
back before YouTube you had to be kind

210
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:29,478
of an actor or some sort of celebrity to

211
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,079
to get on camera so uh yeah it's kind of

212
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,000
up the floodgates there for anybody to

213
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,918
really have an opportunity so for your

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,319
particular channel the grow under the

215
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,519
stairs can you talk to us about that

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,639
channel like what it's about when it got

217
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,279
started your style of content over there

218
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,280
so on and so forth okay so so the reason

219
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,519
I started growing at home the medicinal

220
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,359
plant that we all love was out of fear I

221
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,158
found myself one time we all have these

222
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,400
stories I found myself in New York

223
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,519
needing to to buy something because all

224
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,839
of my usual people didn't have it

225
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,560
anymore and it was one of those sketchy

226
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,679
situations where you're in one of these

227
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,478
dark rooms with some people that you

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,280
don't know they're all looking at you

229
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,918
funny their weapons on the table there's

230
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,198
that type of deal and you're you're not

231
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,560
part of that world I just want a little

232
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,199
something to relax and uh I had that

233
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,720
situation happen to me I I I got scared

234
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,800
straight I came back home and I said

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,080
listen I'm going to have to start

236
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,079
growing because it's not worth it to

237
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,399
keep doing this so this was back when it

238
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,679
was super illegal and I had to go into

239
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,799
New York to do that so I figured you

240
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,199
know what I mean if I'm going to take a

241
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
risk let me take a risk and start

242
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,879
growing at home from there I'm a content

243
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,320
creator by trade so I it just became

244
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,278
part of what I did I'm like let me start

245
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,600
a channel then and let me uh showcase

246
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:51,919
what I'm doing and I I teach as uh at

247
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,759
the same time as I'm learning and I'm a

248
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,559
comedian so that would be my angle that

249
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,200
that's what I could offer different to

250
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,119
this community it's like let me make it

251
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
entertaining so that while you're

252
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,000
learning you're also laughing I feel

253
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,560
like that's a a nice niche that within

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,159
the niche that I'm carving out for

255
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,439
myself and nobody else is really doing

256
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,879
that you know what I mean you have that

257
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,079
unique style of both education and

258
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,439
entertainment humor that not many people

259
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,359
are doing and and one thing I like about

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,600
your content is that you're you're

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
showing the plants right you're in your

262
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,959
garden you're giving them valuable

263
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,319
information but you're also showing a

264
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,078
little bit about your personal life as

265
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,480
well you know you're showing your cats

266
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,879
you're showing you going out to dinner

267
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,200
you're showing this massive snowman that

268
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,278
you saw uh down the street that broke a

269
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,160
record I think in Anchorage Alaska which

270
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,480
you live now so seeing like all of that

271
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,240
together it's like it's different than

272
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,959
everybody so I think you have some

273
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
really good content and you also grow

274
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,319
some really good looking plants you grow

275
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,959
some fire and you know another thing I

276
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,040
was thinking about before we you know as

277
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,278
we were planning this is like okay if we

278
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,039
start talking about content creation

279
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:53,559
some people are going to want to

280
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,719
actually know how you how you grow your

281
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,078
plants they're going to be disappointed

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,200
like oh man I want to know how to grow

283
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,239
his plants like him you know so maybe

284
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,680
we'll we'll do something like that that

285
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,759
in the future to where we do talk about

286
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,439
you know break down your style of

287
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,519
growing and stuff like that because I do

288
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
have a feeling that some people are

289
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,600
going to be like what the heck I want to

290
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,838
know how he grows fire you know yeah

291
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,040
yeah but you know um the videos

292
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,040
themselves are about that I do weekly

293
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,838
videos that that display weekly what the

294
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,559
plants are doing and I feel like a lot

295
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,360
of people have strayed away from that

296
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,958
kind of content because you know YouTube

297
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
restricts what they show and who they

298
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,239
push if you're showing certain things

299
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,959
and saying certain things but I think

300
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,399
it's still important to to look at these

301
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,039
plants as they develop and Tackle these

302
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,240
problems that arise on a week toe basis

303
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,319
you know I love the whole uh from C to

304
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,799
harvest videos but I feel like there's a

305
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,639
lot that gets missed you know you're not

306
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,240
going to throw in that you

307
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:52,278
sprayed iron for an iron deficiency for

308
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,039
one day and it fixed it in in in a video

309
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,720
that's an hour long from C you know

310
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,599
you're not you're going to forget you're

311
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,200
not going to forget in a weekly video so

312
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I feel like uh uh I'm going continue

313
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,040
doing this and hopefully people would

314
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,959
just learn to have a little bit of

315
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,439
patience and come and just look at the

316
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,838
plant and learn from it uh even if it's

317
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,519
like little by little you know that's

318
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,200
how they grow it takes time it takes

319
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,000
patience so that's kind of what I'm

320
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
offering too yeah really good point

321

330
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,000
touch about the other the other thing um

331
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,799
when when you spoke about sharing my

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,958
personal life in the videos and

333
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,439
everything like that it's kind of crazy

334
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,119
and and I wonder if it's the same for

335
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,440
you since we've been doing this for so

336
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,360
long but when I started the the the

337
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,720
videos that I was doing were about

338
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,399
travel you know about my traveling and

339
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,399
my experiences after that I switched to

340
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,679
Comedy you know I started doing the

341
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,879
comedy after that I switched to to

342
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,159
cooking I was doing cooking and and now

343
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,679
I'm here in this gardening space but all

344
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:08,278
of the stuff that I learned before I'm

345
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,838
able to apply it here so I am using

346
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,759
comedy still you know what I mean I'm

347
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,040
just mixing everything together is it

348
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,399
the same for you where you get to it's

349
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,360
almost like you you're acquiring skills

350
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,159
in every step of the way and then you

351
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,199
end up here you just know how to do so

352
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,039
much you know what I mean yeah for me

353
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,879
kind of like I started out doing just

354
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,879
dumb videos with my friends uploading

355
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,958
those and then I actually did I was

356
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,639
recording prank videos on the Strip here

357
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,958
in Las Vegas going there filming hidden

358
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,039
camera prank videos and then yeah I

359
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,278
guess some of the stuff I think some of

360
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,838
like more like the behind the scenes

361
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,480
YouTube stuff like the titles

362
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,959
descriptions tags all that stuff that

363
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,079
kind of get you farther over reach that

364
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,958
stuff can be applied to this so yeah I

365
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,439
totally get what you mean by what you've

366
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,119
learned before definitely comes over to

367
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,920
this same Niche because you're still

368
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,320
making videos yeah I totally get what

369
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,759
you mean by that and I I completely

370
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,160
agree so you're wearing a mask right now

371
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,039
and you wear a mask in all your videos

372
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,600
what made you wear a mask you need to

373
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,439
HDE your identity are you doing things

374
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,680
illegal over there or or what and will

375
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,680
your face ever be revealed or is this

376
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,039
always gonna be like that I am not a

377
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,799
crook well you know there's there's two

378
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,000
reasons for the mask the the first one

379
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,879
being you know when I started this it

380
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,360
was it was super illegal where I was at

381
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,278
so uh I didn't want to get in trouble as

382
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,480
I kept doing the videos the law started

383
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,360
to change in my favor

384
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,519
but then there was the second thing and

385
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
that's that I've actually found success

386
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,399
before in content creation so I didn't

387
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,759
want to mix the audience that I've

388
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,320
already created on another space with

389
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,799
this audience because I already know

390
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,680
that that audience uh is not all there

391
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,359
when it comes to the medicinal plant

392
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,239
that you know I like to talk about but

393
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,440
hopefully uh as things keep changing

394
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,919
people will be a little bit more

395
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,480
accepting and then I'll be able to take

396
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,120
off the mask but it is something that

397
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm I'm really close to wanting to do

398
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,560
you know like is in my heart I want to

399
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,159
be able to uh show uh share with the

400
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,599
public and you know and intermingle with

401
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,919
people and you know it's kind of fun

402
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,199
when you're in an event and somebody

403
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,679
says hey you know I saw your video and

404
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:16,399
everything like that and I missed that

405
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,319
so hopefully I be able to be fresh face

406
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,159
with y'all soon yeah that'd be cool

407
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,680
that'd be cool to see a face reveal and

408
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,198
I get what you mean by you know you can

409
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,239
be recognized by people in your that

410
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,879
were watching your old videos right some

411
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,000
might not like that regarding the the

412
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,879
niche that we're in also I actually can

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,519
totally relate I had to hide my face

414
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,159
when I first started making Grill videos

415
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,278
cuz I had an employer right I was afraid

416
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,120
I was a manager at

417
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,399
amazon.com and so like I was afraid that

418
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,440
my associates were going to be

419
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,879
recognizing me and they be oh you grow

420
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,440
weak huh so it's like H you know so

421
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,320
hiding identities I I can relate yeah

422
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
and you know it's funny

423
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,240
um when I first started watching trying

424
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,078
to to learn to grow I was actually

425
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,720
watching you guys so I was watching I

426
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:09,638
was watching pigeons actually you know

427
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,839
and that was before he showed his face

428
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,440
that was the OG pigeons that was the

429
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,880
pigeons that I you know that I was uh

430
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,920
that that I could relate to and and and

431
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,039
it was it's crazy

432
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,879
cuz the reason I was able to figure like

433
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,480
the mask out is because I'm like hey if

434
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,039
he could do it without a face everything

435
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,278
else I had been doing before had been

436
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,198
with my

437
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,600
I've never seen anyone do it like that

438
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,599
you know like without a face so I'm like

439
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,560
if he could do it if they could do it

440
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,920
then I could just you know I could do it

441
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,559
too and actually that gave me the

442
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,719
courage to start that's actually a

443
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,958
question I was going to ask you is where

444
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,800
do you get your inspiration from was it

445
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,638
it seems like part of it was pigeons was

446
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,278
there anybody else that kind of inspired

447
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,720
you um Mr Canucks I I you know I

448
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,519
definitely uh watch a lot of his videos

449
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,360
and the fact that it seems like he put

450
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,240
so much work into it you know there's

451
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,278
people that really do like they they go

452
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,198
to work work on their videos and and to

453
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,278
me that's inspiring because it makes me

454
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,879
be better you know I don't I don't have

455

forget nobody but uh how we grows I

492
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,440

495
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,200
mean a whole bunch of people if you make

496
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,720
content uh about the plant I'm probably

497
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,319
trying to learn from you some way or

498
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,200
another like either by watching your

499
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,599
videos as far as quality and how you do

500
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,960
your thing or watching how you grow so

501
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,558
of those content creators or you can

502
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,919
expand it to even beyond that which one

503
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,720
do you kind of recommend to people if

504
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,720
somebody were to ask you hey where can I

505
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,038
find good content besides your channel

506
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
who would you say I mean definitely you

507
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,558
you know I mean you guys should check

508
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,759
out Mr Grow you know check out your groc

509
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:18,158
series and everything like that but uh

510
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:21,319
you know I I like I like Mr Canucks man

511
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,720
I think he's a a a person that everybody

512
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,720
could appreciate or in general you know

513
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,679
like you could appreciate the art he

514
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,000
also grows a lot of fire and he's not as

515
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,240
abrasive as me I'm I'm in your face I'm

516
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,720
right here I'm right you know he's not

517
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,599
he's more like laidback so are you which

518
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,640
is a better entry point for more people

519
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,759
I I I think uh if I were to recommend

520
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,600
somebody I would do either you or Mr

521
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,960
Canuck I think that's a great way to go

522
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,119
how about uh Dakota from homeg gr TV you

523
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,120

527
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,879
day like like I can't believe the amount

528
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,639
of work that you put in your videos man

529
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,559
like that's another level of of work and

530
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,520
and and I don't I haven't met him in

531
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,798
person I don't know his personality if

532
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,720
it's the same as in the videos but when

533
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,558
I when I watch stuff like that it makes

534
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,360
me want to grab the dude and and and ask

535
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,399
him a whole bunch of questions related

536
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,000
to how his day goes and how he plans

537
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,280
these things because he's really really

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,558
uh he you know his work speaks for

539
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,639

545

549
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,158
this very fun short to the point kind of

550
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,480
jokes uh so I would recommend for jokes

551
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,720
man basement Grow Show on Instagram

552
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,038
that's that's that's right at the top of

553
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,839
the list for me yeah grower Joe is funny

554
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,919
he's so funny I met him in person I met

555
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:11,639
Dakota in person he is the nicest person

556
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,840
both of those guys are extremely nice

557
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,000
but Dakota is just he's just so humble

558
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,918
and like he's just so appreciative you

559
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,359
know and I give him feedback hey dude

560
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
your videos are awesome totally Next

561
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,959
Level if anybody hasn't tuned in to

562
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,519
homerow TV on YouTube search for it and

563
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,038
check out his videos because that's like

564
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,440
the number one guy right now who's

565
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,319
really pushing it to the next level when

566
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,279
it comes to video production

567
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,720
storytelling educating the viewer so on

568
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,319
and so forth so I can't speak uh highly

569
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,919
enough about him he's a a great great

570
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:45,399
dude another one I would personally

571
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,480
recommend is build the soil I know you

572
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,440
mentioned him right but as far as

573
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,279
organic gardening definitely the the

574
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,159
education is there if you want to learn

575
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,399
how to grow organically just build a

576
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,840
soil by far is is probably one of the

577
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,400
best if not the best channels out there

578
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,240
for sure but this is uh you know like I

579
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,798
like to categorize some of these into

580
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,640
different Cate you know into uh

581
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,079
different places like some of these I

582
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
only watch for entertainment purposes

583
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,399
build the soil is one where you're going

584
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,119
to school so you know to be honest I

585
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,480
don't know if that would be the first

586
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,359
place I would send you if you don't know

587
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,079
what you're doing at all H you know I

588
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,158
feel like he speaks about a lot of

589
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,879
advanced stuff and a lot of things that

590
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,799
that

591
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,360
people you know I feel like you got to

592
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,558
have your foot in already maybe to to to

593
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,079
check out Builder soil you know what I

594
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,200
mean I totally get what you mean yeah I

595
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,839
completely agree with you there are

596
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,880
things that be brones beginner walks in

597
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,639
there and starts listening to to him

598
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,039
talk that things might go over his head

599
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,159
left they're walking right

600
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,720
up forget this I'm sticking on my

601
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,600
bottles you

602
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,880
know right yeah I completely agree there

603
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,079
are different categories you know the

604
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,480
humor there's education things that's

605
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,359
just entertainment there talking head

606
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,960
videos there's people that show plants

607
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,199
people that don't show plants you've

608
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,079
actually been pretty vocal that you had

609
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,840
some concerns about yeah say the current

610
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,240
state of content creation you know

611
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,558
people showing plants people not showing

612
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,038
plants can you kind of expand on that

613
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:15,879
yeah you know YouTube is it is kind of

614
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,119
not clear on as far as like the rules

615
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,559
when it comes to what we're doing

616
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,319
because it says that we're okay it says

617
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,200
that we're okay to say it it says we're

618
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,558
okay to show certain things you know but

619
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,600
then it doesn't it doesn't act like it's

620
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:32,918
okay

621
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:35,558
so my problem is when when when us as

622
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,240
creators stop showing the plant we're

623
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,319
also saying it's not okay we're we're

624
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,599
it's like I feel like we're agreeing by

625
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,519
by by doing it so in my opinion I feel

626
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,000
like if it is okay then let's treat it

627
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,759
like it's okay and let's show it like

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,200
it's okay let's talk about it like it's

629
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,679
okay instead of doing the opposite you

630
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,558
know that and it's not as interesting

631
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,159
for me to hear people just talk about

632
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,000
something that I love to see part of the

633
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,360
reason I wake up every day is to see the

634
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,759
changes in the plant I actually enjoy

635
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,399
that that gives me energy I'm able to

636
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,079
record the videos because that same

637
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
excitement that I feel I'm able to

638
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,158
capture it you know it's easy to go

639
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,558
there and like oh my God look at this

640
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,480
plant and then just put a camera in

641
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,678
front of it that did itself you know and

642
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,599
and when you sit when you take that the

643
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,480
aspect of the plant away for me it takes

644
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:31,439
some of that excitement away as well so

645
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,880
as a fan I would love to to continue

646
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
seeing plants as a person that's a

647
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,559
proponent of the plant I would love for

648
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,240
people to make it more to normalize it

649
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,240
and act like if it's okay you know yeah

650
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,359
I understand and YouTube has changed so

651
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,880
much I mean back in you could monetize

652
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,599
the content you know what I mean you can

653
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,960
monetize and actually get paid for your

654
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,558
work a lot of people don't think that oh

655
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
you're just uploading YouTube videos why

656
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,480
should you get paid for it's like it's

657
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,000
work it's videography you know you're

658
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,960
filming you're editing you're putting in

659
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,720
hours you know you saying that oh people

660
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,400
making TV shows they shouldn't get paid

661
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,798
you know oh forget the people who film

662
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,240
there forget the people who do the

663
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,000
editing you know none of them should get

664
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,640
paid they're just making videos you

665
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,880
could say that about anything oh Uber

666
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,000
drivers they're just driving people

667
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,480
around why should they get paid driving

668
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,079
it just doesn't make sense driving yeah

669
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
I don't get when people oh you're just

670
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,639
making YouTube videos you shouldn't

671
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,678
really get paid for that don't worry

672
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,759
about getting paid and so like I don't

673
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,840
know I'm kind of against that I

674
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,798
personally I have a clean Channel and

675
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,759
dirty Channel now I have a dirty Channel

676
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,879
which I which I show my plants because

677
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,519
YouTube is very restrictive now

678
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,039
everything has to be 18 plus they

679
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,839
suppress your videos you can't monetize

680
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,398
it right so I'm not I don't get paid at

681
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,639
all right all the all the time energy

682
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,519
I'm spending on creating those videos I

683
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
get nothing in return for it you know

684
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,158
now luckily I have sponsors who help

685
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,159
with uh you know funding my content

686
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,960
creation Affiliates uh things like that

687
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,120
so that's kind of helping me keep a flow

688
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,720
but I want to get paid for my work and

689
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:03,319
so kind of having a clean Channel where

690
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,079
I abide by YouTube's guidelines and and

691
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,079
still be able to reach an audience and

692
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,398
still be able to relay things tiptoeing

693
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,480
around their guidelines in a sense I

694
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:13,119
think that's a good thing I want to kind

695
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,079
of reach more more of an audience and

696
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,000
not be suppressed for once and and be

697
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,599
compensated for my work so I I could

698
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,839
kind of see it both ways I can see why

699
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,079
people stopped showing plants you know

700
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,599
it makes you put all this energy into it

701
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,000
you get nothing out of it okay well I'll

702
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,759
just sit back and make talking head

703
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,599
videos and then I will get paid for it

704
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,200
you know what I mean so it's like I

705
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,359
understand why everything shifted the

706
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,679
way it did but uh I I'm with you like I

707
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,959
I really feel like it would be nice if

708
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,640
people still made videos about plants

709
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,919
and just yeah I enjoyed that content as

710
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,559
well so and you know even in the the

711
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,360
parody that I did I mentioned uh

712
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:51,000
specifically that that the way that you

713
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,959
did it is good you have a different

714
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,480
channel that you show your stuff and I

715
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
can't tell people how to run their

716
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,120
business you know at the end of the day

717
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,000
this this is just my opinion and I'm

718
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,558
coming at it from a Fan's perspective I

719
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,798
want to see the plant you know what I

720
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,398
mean I want to put on my YouTube and I

721
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,440
want to see the plant bro like that's

722
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,839
what it comes down to so I'm going to

723
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,360
push for that just for my own personal

724
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,079
uh Gams you know but I also think it is

725
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,678
important to to normalize it you know I

726
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,319
don't want to I don't want to hide it if

727
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,200
it's not something that needs to be

728
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,038
hidden if that's not how you feel and

729
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,519
you know like I'm G even take it

730
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:31,079
further you know we we we come from the

731
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,158
era of where it was really illegal you

732
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,720
know like it it people really went to

733
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,320
jail for this people were the only

734
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,759
reason we even at the point where we

735
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,278
could do these videos is because they're

736
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,640
people that gave their freedom for it

737
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,000
they're people that you know stood

738
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,960
outside and said I'm going to sell this

739
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,839
I believe in this I'm going to smoke

740
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,319
this I believe in this outside even if

741
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,079
I'm getting arrested or whatever the

742
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,439
consequences are so now it's like I'mma

743
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,278
lose my YouTube channel like that's okay

744
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,038
bro like I'm GNA take that L if if

745
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,759
that's what it comes with at the same

746
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:04,119
time I have a mask on so I don't want to

747
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,278
pretend that I'm toly I'm still not

748
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,839
risking anything you know what I mean so

749
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,519
uh uh I feel like my channel could be

750
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,879
the sacrificial lamb if if if it needs

751
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,119
to be in my case because I saw so many

752
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,679
other people risk so much more got to

753
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,879
keep fighting the fight you know but

754
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,840
yeah it is tough that YouTube is really

755
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,120
suppressing people I mean I actually had

756
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,839
another content creator hit me up this

757
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,158
morning he's like dude I received a

758
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,439
strike what do I do and I'm like what do

759
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,760
you what do you think you received a

760
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,480
strike for and he's like I think it's

761
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,440
because I I promoted Grove bags I'm like

762
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,399
think in my head what Grove bags and he

763
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,640
sent me a clip of his video and he's

764
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,639
promoting Grove bags he has the the the

765
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,600
website for Grove bags he's got his

766
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,038
discount code and he's showing the Grove

767
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,759
bags empty and then he's showing them

768
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,000
with buds in it so YouTube probably

769
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,759
thinks that hey you want to buy these

770
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
bags see the bag actual full thing

771
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,398
strike so they think that hey he's

772
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,359
directing them to where they can

773
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,000
purchase it and that's where YouTube has

774
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,000
a huge no no you can't link to anywhere

775
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,880
we can purchase it um also with the

776
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,720
seeds as well you can't link to anywhere

777
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,200
where you can purchase those I know a

778
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,798
lot of people shy away from even talking

779
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
about it because I I think you can get

780
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,158
strikes for that I don't really know

781
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,679
YouTube's so unclear and you kind of

782
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,799
touch upon this it's

783
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,480
like it's like we're walking on a tight

784
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,440
rope we don't know which way to go in a

785
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,759
sense how to kind of balance things out

786
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200
it's it's tough right so I so so so

787
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,720
because of these things like like look

788
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,480
at that right there he says he thinks he

789
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,960
thinks is because of the growth backs

790
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,720
like we don't know it's not even that

791
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,679
clear so that's part of the problem so

792
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,679
because of that I also understand when

793
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,960
when people do choose to just do talking

794
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,919
head videos and and you know find

795
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,679
different ways around it because like

796
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,960
you said you know these these videos

797
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,679
take take a long time to do we do put a

798
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,558
lot of work into it and not only that

799
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,000
man like these videos stay on our minds

800
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,079
the whole time we're working on them you

801
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,480
know it might look like I'm only editing

802
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:04,240
for for two hours today but I'm thinking

803
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,319
of the storyline the whole day like it's

804
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,159
burning me it's burning it's burning me

805
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,720
down to ashes so I understand when

806
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
people change the way they do things

807
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,079
because they need to get paid they need

808
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,600
to make a living off of this so it's

809
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,000
there's no knock to them I'm just again

810
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,798
as a fan and as somebody that enjoys the

811
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
plant that's why I wake up uh I want to

812
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,359
see it I want you to show it

813
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,038
baby that makes sense this next question

814
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,398
it kind of relates to just talking about

815
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:32,879
I think is like you the fact that lots

816
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,239
of YouTube content creators that are are

817
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,159
filming their plants they start a

818
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,679
channel then they disappear within the

819
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,399
first year or two because either the

820
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,200
video gets no traction YouTube

821
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:46,119
suppresses them they get strikes so on

822
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,798
and so forth what keeps you going you

823
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,678
know I I'm a fan of the videos

824
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,759
themselves at the end of the day uh it's

825
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,000
kind of weird and I know I know I I

826
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,679
don't know if I'm going explain this

827
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,599
well but I know I'm doing the videos I

828
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,600
sit there I edit I record I'm thinking

829
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,959
I'm burning my brain I'm whatever but

830
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,519
once the video is done and it's on the

831
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,200
TV and I'm playing it on YouTube or

832
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,759
whatever I'm a fan of that video like I

833
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,240
am if I become a different person it

834
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,960
becomes magic to me I don't know how I

835
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,919
made it I was there the whole time but I

836
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,038
don't know how that came out it makes

837
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,880
sense what I'm watching make sense and

838
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,640
it's

839
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,799
own apart from me so that is a that's

840
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,559
like a high that I need in general I

841
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,839
need to get that video I need it for

842
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:38,960
myself that's the main thing I enjoy

843
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:41,158
what I'm doing uh the second thing is

844
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,600
the response from the public I'm able to

845
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,000
see you know as a YouTube you can go to

846
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,798
YouTube and check your analytics I love

847
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,880
the fact that I made a video that's 12

848
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:54,440
minutes long and I got 70% retention 70%

849
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:00,120
of people that started watching that

850
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:02,720
video ended that video to me I feel like

851
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,439
it feels like this to me it's like man

852
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,759

853
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,320

854
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,119
laughed when I watch it my jokes hit you

855
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,079
know you enjoyed the plan like I enjoyed

856
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,759
it just talking about it it gets me this

857
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,038
is where I come from you know like this

858
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:20,798
is my video right here like this energy

859
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,119
that's what keeps me going and the

860
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,759
actual creation process certainly get

861
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,759
you fired up as well uh you put so much

862
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,398
into your videos I can tell just by

863
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,519
watching it me being a content creator

864
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,439
I'm like looking I'm watching your

865
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,960
videos I'm like man this is this must

866
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,440
taken him 10 plus hours per video I mean

867
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,600
the amount of uh effects transitions

868
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,600
overlays uh you're doing skits in there

869
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,480
all that stuff the filming part of it

870
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,719
how long does it take you to film a

871
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,720
video edit a video like what's that

872
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,960
process look like for you it it feels

873
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,839
like the whole week you know it feels

874
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,519
like a working week even though it's not

875
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,240
40 hours because it's in my head the

876
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,599
whole week it feels you know it feels

877
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
like the whole week but I'll give you an

878
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,480
example the narration part of it which

879
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,720
is the last thing I

880
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,120
do uh to record a a 12 minute it takes

881
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,278
me about one hour to record two to three

882
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,719
minutes of

883
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,679
audio so if that's just what it works

884
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,079
out to and um so that that that'll give

885
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,919
you like an idea of how much effort goes

886
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:29,398
into into one of these things so I'm

887
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:33,038
sitting there for hours hours trying to

888
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:36,359
just come up with silly things to you

889
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:39,359
know uh and and the rest of the video is

890
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,959
sort of as it happens I record things as

891
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,359
they happen as I need to do them so this

892
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,440
week I need to water change the

893
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,959
reservoir I record when that is going on

894
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,639
you know I don't I don't try to make

895
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,720
anything happen I don't try to change

896
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,479
anything it's more like I want to take

897
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,440
notes of what I'm doing Are there

898
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,839
specific topics that you feel like are

899
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,558
kind of more popular than others oh yeah

900
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,879
for sure so the howto this is listen if

901
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:06,319
you guys are starting a Channel howto

902
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,760
videos are going to get you everywhere

903
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,678
you know uh how to maximize yields those

904
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,440
type of

905
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:17,480
videos uh you know those are going to

906
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,200
get you very far but uh you have to know

907
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,639
what you're talking about I think that's

908
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
important a lot of people just

909
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:25,000
regurgitate the same information and

910
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,200
they just want to do it because it gets

911
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,679
a lot of views and they end up putting

912
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,360
the same wrong information don't do that

913
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,559
you know if you wantan to in my opinion

914
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:37,119
if you're gonna do a how-to video make

915
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,558
sure you it's from experience I think

916
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,119
it's always it comes out better bro yeah

917
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,678
I remember I've had so many of those

918
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,038

two dozen times but that's a that's an

971
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:46,078
event for that you for the thing itself

972
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,639
right yeah yeah but no I mean for the

973
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,839
most part I just I don't really care to

974
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,118
be recognized and stuff and if somebody

975
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:53,719
does recognize me and comes off to me

976
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,200
and says what's up that's cool like

977
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,799
let's have a conversation about growing

978
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,480
where I said in recent podcast is kind

979
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,240
of a rare breed in a sense like there's

980
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,599
not many people really in the grand

981
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:06,399
shika things in like this the world that

982
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,838
actually grow this plant so like we got

983
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,680
something in common like let's hang out

984
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,400
and talk you know so exactly yeah it's

985
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,318
cool I think it's I think it's one of

986
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,039
the most enjoyable parts of of the

987
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,400
situation is connecting with the person

988
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:23,000
so it's it's cool when you connec in per

989
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
on the internet and in person is even

990
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,480
cooler absolutely so we talked about

991
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,639
like hot topics things that are kind of

992
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,159
popular what about cold topics that

993
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,960
people kind of don't seem interested in

994
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,759
these days uh well you if you want the

995
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,960
exact titles for the cold topics you

996
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,040
just go to my page and check out all the

997
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,240
titles that I

998
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:47,119
have but um you know yeah I think it

999
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,318
used to be when I started watching it

1000
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,119
used to be week by week that used to be

1001
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,279
what people did week one a flower week

1002
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,680
two of flower and again I guess those

1003
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,640
topics have died down and now it's more

1004
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,960
more like the SE to harvest situation

1005
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,679
which is more popular but I still like I

1006
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,358
said I still enjoy the week to week but

1007
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,239
uh those are the topics that like week

1008
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,440
number one of flower number two number

1009
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,879
three uh you're not going to get much

1010
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,358
attaction if those are your titles

1011
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,640
you're going to get a very specific

1012
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,318
amount of people that are looking for

1013
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,400
that specific information and that's it

1014
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,719
yeah me personally I feel like things in

1015
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,358
veg like the vegetation stage nobody

1016
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,639
really clicks on those videos as much as

1017
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,039
flower stage right we know it's all

1018
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,318
about the title and thumbnail to whether

1019
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,639
or not the person clicks whether or not

1020
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:33,159
they watch is a whole different story

1021
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,719
but to get that initial click which is

1022
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,920
what shows up as a view on on YouTube

1023
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,719
showing a flowering plant you're going

1024
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,720
to get a lot more clicks than you would

1025
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,279
just showing a veg planter or even a

1026
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:45,239
Seedling plant although some Seedling

1027
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,440
videos do pretty good like if you say

1028
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,838
week one video you typically does pretty

1029
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,920
good for me you know week one seedling

1030
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,799
just starting a new grow you know people

1031
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,760
want to start from the beginning and so

1032
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,880
those videos do pretty good but the veg

1033
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,200
videos haven't been doing good good for

1034
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,640
me flower videos do a lot better seed to

1035
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,480
harvest videos like you mentioned do

1036
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,879
really really well where people can see

1037
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,000
see everything you know from seed all

1038
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,760
the way to harvest so yeah there are

1039
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,239
definitely some some cold topics I'm

1040
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,560
trying to think of other coold topics I

1041
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,799
think like unboxing videos are cold now

1042
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,279
like nobody really clicks on those yeah

1043
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,800
it might be too saturated and you know I

1044
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,400
think you guys spoke on this uh but uh

1045
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,920
the light technology seems to have

1046
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,559
slowed down as far as like how uh fast

1047
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,240
it was moving so it feels like now you

1048
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,199
kind of getting the same light over and

1049
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,039
over again as so now where I used to

1050
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,039
watch Channels and I didn't mention them

1051
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,000
because of this that that used to just

1052
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,519
review lights uh now I'm not watching

1053
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,719
that anymore because this seems like

1054
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,519
it's the same the same uh we we maybe

1055
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,959
reached a little ceiling for it so

1056
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:54,039
perhaps that's why unboxing

1057
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,880
videos have also maybe fell to because

1058
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,599
the the the equipment doesn't seem to be

1059
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,880
advancing as fast as it was just a a

1060
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,720
couple years ago yeah I completely agree

1061
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,680
yeah it's the lighting technology just

1062
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,358
just in the past year in particular it's

1063
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,960
kind of gotten a little little boring

1064
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,639
all these companies are releasing the

1065
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,880
same diodes and not really doing much as

1066
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,679
far as upgrades and it's good on price

1067
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,920
it's good it feels like the pricing is

1068
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:19,919
now getting better because everybody has

1069
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,000
the same uh components but so that's

1070
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,119
good but as far as yeah unboxing and and

1071
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,960
the excitement of a new toy you know it

1072
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,480
that that excitement is not there right

1073
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,760
now for me do you think it's still worth

1074
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,480
it to create beginner type content on

1075
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,640
like basic topics like how to germinate

1076
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,599
how to train plants how to set up a grow

1077
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,598
tent when there are like a countless

1078
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,599
number of other of these types of videos

1079
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,200
on YouTube already you know it's like

1080
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,680
saying you know the same reason why

1081
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,480
movies keep getting

1082
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,519
remade uh it's a new generation there's

1083
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,559
PE new people being born every day so

1084
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,079
you know I think there is a space for uh

1085
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,599
let's say even somebody that's watching

1086
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,920
this video right now that's thinking

1087
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,880
about joining YouTube and thinking uh

1088
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,760
what what what can I contribute what you

1089
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,039
got to contribute is your voice and your

1090
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,960
style the way that you're going to say

1091
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,599
that information to others so I think it

1092
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,000
is important to still make those videos

1093
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,960
in your way cuz uh there might be a

1094
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
person that specifically learns the way

1095
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,280
that you teach so is your duty to do

1096
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,920
that for that

1097
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,359
person and uh not only that

1098
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,200
but if you're a content creator then you

1099
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:31,519
moving off of energy of of excitement

1100
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,919
I'm very excited every time I set up a

1101
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,159
new tent I'm very excited every time I

1102
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,400
plant a new seed because I don't know

1103
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,799
what it's going to be you know what I

1104
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,960
mean like I'm excited to see what's

1105
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,519
going to happen why not record that and

1106
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,159
share that every time I do it every time

1107
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,880
yeah you make a good point there for

1108
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,358
sure you especially as legalization

1109
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,240
sweeps Across the Nation here it's like

1110
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,279
more and more people are new you know

1111
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,479
it's it's more and more people coming on

1112
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,200
board so having these basic beginner

1113
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,838
type videos is is valuable and I think

1114
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:03,919
with YouTube the ranking comes into play

1115
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,119
like you know how old the video is some

1116
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
old videos certainly are still going to

1117
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,440
show up on the ranking when you search

1118
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,358
for them but newer videos could

1119
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,838
potentially show up newer on the ranking

1120
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:14,119
so yeah no you bring up a good point

1121
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,039
yeah and you you should always be

1122
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,640
looking for new content you know even if

1123
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:21,358
it's the same thing again uh you're

1124
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,920
doing it again it's new you know it's a

1125
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,400
new day you might do it a little

1126
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,400
different maybe you're you're using

1127
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,480
different kind of people P than you used

1128
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,920
before you know like anything you

1129
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,679
anything that's different could be

1130
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,079
beneficial to somebody watching to a to

1131
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:39,279
a beginner just like you said uh with

1132
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,640
legalization just about to well it keeps

1133
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,800
getting better for everybody I'm not

1134
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,239
going to say it's going to Fally be

1135
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,359
legal because that just keeps taking

1136
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:51,000
forever but um every day you get new

1137
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:52,279
people that are interested so so be

1138
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,039
there for those people just like

1139
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,760
somebody was there for you yeah

1140
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:58,079
absolutely well said we've been talking

1141
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,760
a lot about YouTube and YouTube videos I

1142
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,800
mean that's where you know me and you

1143
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,520
are kind of our passion that's what

1144
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,240
that's what our focus is on but there

1145
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,440
are other communities on other platforms

1146
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,199
right what are your thoughts on

1147
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,720
gardening content on the other platforms

1148
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:15,480
like Reddit Facebook Instagram so on and

1149
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,039
so forth man you know

1150
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,440
um I haven't had the best of luck on

1151
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:23,000
other platforms I just joined X I just

1152
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,920
followed you over there so I heard that

1153
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,079
X is actually uh uh very friendly to

1154
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,559
creators on on our side so you know I

1155
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,880
got the verifi badge and and and let's

1156
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:38,000
see is if that's a that's a fact so I'm

1157
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,039
excited for that Instagram has been bad

1158
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,920
for me you know I've had profiles get

1159
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:46,400
banned a bunch of times uh and and and

1160
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,200
you know it makes it it it's to the

1161
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,240
point where you can't really they just

1162
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,039
ban you they don't even tell you why you

1163
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,279
can't contact anybody it seems like you

1164
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,920
can't uh plead your case to anybody it

1165
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,599
seems like so definitely don't recommend

1166
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,838
that one uh Discord has been good so far

1167
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,920
you know um those are the ones that I'm

1168
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,119
using at the moment I focus mostly on

1169
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,000
YouTube though so that's where my bread

1170
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,519
and butter is I've tried to go on

1171
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,280
Facebook they slap me on the wrist

1172
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:17,119
before on my page on there I still have

1173
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,800
one but they don't like some of the

1174
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,200
content I post there I tried joining a

1175
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,318
lot of the Facebook groups because

1176
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:25,039
there's like a lot of grow groups and

1177
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:28,400
man I have not signed up to a group and

1178
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,599
left a group so quick before the

1179
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,680
toxicity in some of those groups I just

1180
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,920
I could not stand you know somebody post

1181
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,000
a picture of a plant they're like what's

1182
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,880
wrong with my plant and you get 50

1183
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,920
million replies from people and some of

1184
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,960
them are hating on the guy them day with

1185
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,800
the

1186
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,720
Forum it's so crazy man it's like so

1187
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,519
much mixed information and just hate and

1188
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,078
H same thing with Reddit like haven't

1189
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,159
really had a good experience it's just

1190
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,760
at least for me there was negativity a

1191
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:59,358
lot of negativity on there and it just

1192
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,960
it didn't feel like a community and I

1193
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,838
don't want to speak it like it's a

1194
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,358
blanket right I'm sure there are good

1195
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:06,279
communities out there within redit good

1196
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:09,159
subreddits I know there was one science

1197
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,680
back one I think was like R Bud science

1198
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:11,719
which had some good information on there

1199
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,279
they're really trying to break things

1200
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:16,759
down there but uh yeah my experience on

1201
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,839
those platforms hasn't been that well

1202
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,160
Instagram they're always penalizing

1203
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,480
people and and they they have this

1204
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,799
review program when you appeal stuff

1205
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,519
that's automatically automated I don't

1206
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,640
even know if real people look at these

1207
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,000
posts that get appealed and stuff and

1208
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,279
you just get shot down and accounts get

1209
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,639
deleted and then they come back and it's

1210
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,119
a mess over there so yeah I I personally

1211
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,799
haven't had a great experience on some

1212
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,280
of these other platforms as well but

1213
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,240
looking into the future how do you see

1214
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,760
gardening content on platforms like

1215
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:50,399
YouTube five years from now I I think it

1216
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,920
could be to the point where we're

1217
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,160
cooking you know how you have a bunch of

1218
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,240
cooking people showing you how to cook

1219
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,318
and it's a thing and everybody does it I

1220
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,879
feel like this has a potential to do the

1221
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,639
same I don't know if it's I don't know

1222
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,838
if it's really going to go like that but

1223
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,759
this has the potential to do the same I

1224
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,480
feel like uh once hom grow is legal if

1225
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,599
you consume the

1226
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,440
plant I don't I don't see a reason to

1227
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,119
not get into it yourself and just have

1228
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,400
like a little tent or something going

1229
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,200
you know like a the the expenses that

1230
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,720
you would have to pay to get any grow

1231
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:28,879
going pays itself back if you're

1232
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,199
somebody that consumes already just by

1233
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,640
The Grow that you're going to get so for

1234
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,318
me because of

1235
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,039
that as as long as we the content

1236
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:39,358
creators keep doing what we're supposed

1237
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,480
to do and getting people excited about

1238
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,239
the plan I feel like we could get more

1239
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,519
people joining and and and making it a

1240
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,679
community just like the cooking

1241
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,838
Community is just maybe in a smaller

1242
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,000
scale but um there's there's so much so

1243
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:55,920
much business opportunity and in in what

1244
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,960
we're doing so many ways to monetize

1245
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,079
channels that I just don't understand

1246
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,519
how YouTube is not letting it happen

1247
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,519
there's medicinal plant companies that

1248
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:09,079
want to actively uh uh uh they want to

1249
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:10,880
advertise in our channels that's a

1250
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,280
that's a money Revenue that you know

1251
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,599
you're not letting us have you not

1252
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,760
letting the company do what they're

1253
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,640
supposed to do why would you get in the

1254
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,240
way of that you know there's so much

1255
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,480
there that's left on the table right now

1256
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,558
that I can't wait till that starts

1257
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,240
happening where YouTube says hey we're

1258
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,160
going to allow these companies that want

1259
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:28,799
to be in your channel to monetize their

1260
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,399
product in your channel that's going to

1261
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,280
be so good I can't wait for that to

1262
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,720
happen do you think this space is

1263
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,280
oversaturated or do you foresee

1264
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,039
oversaturation happening in the future

1265
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,559
it's like anything else you know just

1266
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,039
just like the cooking thing it's the we

1267
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,280
can go right back to that you know

1268
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,318
you a matter of fact let's let's take it

1269
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,440
away from that I watch a whole bunch of

1270
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:52,239
different content creators so for me if

1271
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,760
you love The Plant if you really want to

1272
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,000
learn you're going to eat this up you're

1273
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,920
going to consume and you're going to

1274
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,400
keep wanting that information from as

1275
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,880
many different people as you could get

1276
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,440
it so while yes you could have a bunch

1277
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,880
of people doing it you're only going to

1278
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,400
have a certain amount of people that are

1279
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,880
going to be doing it good you're only

1280
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,240
going to have a certain amount of people

1281
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,640
that are going to be giving quality

1282
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,679
content you know as far as how it looks

1283
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:19,759
how it sounds and people that that you

1284
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,480
know that actively uh trying to find an

1285
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,960
audience not everybody's going to do

1286
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,920
that so I'm not really worried about

1287
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,280
that as long as you focus on doing good

1288
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,200
work you're going to find an audience

1289
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,440
eventually you know cuz cuz it's not

1290
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,799
like I'm only going to watch you and

1291
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,559
then not watch high again you know

1292
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,920
because I watch turpy he I'm not gonna

1293
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,960
watch Bill Ward like it doesn't matter

1294
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,318
I'm gonna watch everybody I love it you

1295
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,519
know I totally get what you mean yeah

1296
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,759
there are a lot of content creators

1297
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:49,000
coming into the space some have really

1298
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,800
good content starting brand new starting

1299
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,480
fresh some content isn't so good but uh

1300
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,200
but they try what advice you have for

1301
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,480
those that are just getting started

1302
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,159
creating gardening content just in

1303
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,318
general I guess it doesn't have you know

1304
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,719
not not only gardening but just since

1305
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,599
I've done so many different types of

1306
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:14,358
content uh what has always motivated me

1307
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,760
is is showing what I'm excited about I I

1308
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,759
saw somewhere that if you want to be

1309
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,119
interesting you have to be interested so

1310
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,559
just show the people what it is that

1311
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,318
you're interested in you know it becomes

1312
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:28,119
very easy to put that on camera

1313
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,838
if you think that oh my god I've never

1314
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:32,800
seen this on a plant

1315
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,838
before then then record that and show me

1316
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,318
that that excitement is already there

1317
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:39,239
you already saw it you don't have to

1318
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,279
make it up so for me the best advice is

1319
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:44,039
that is show me what it is that you're

1320
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,040
excited about and I'm I'mma connect with

1321
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,599
you on that same level and if you could

1322
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:49,358
continue to do that through the video

1323
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,960
then you have a fan I think that's a

1324
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,000
good advice and I think for those folks

1325
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,480
that are looking to start that haven't

1326
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,599
started that feel like they aren't able

1327
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,199
to start because of equipment I know

1328
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:01,519
I've talked to some people like oh I

1329
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:04,759
don't have a camera yet I don't have a

1330
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,239
DSLR you know I don't have a a $3,000

1331
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,160
camera to get started you don't need

1332
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,318
that a lot of people use their iPhone

1333
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,838
you know you get away with using your

1334
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:15,039
iPhone you could buy a $15 tripod on the

1335
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,679
hand and just go around and doing that

1336
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,039
microphones now for a really good one

1337
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:21,358
you could get a good one for 100 bucks

1338
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,358
even cheaper than that on sale so you

1339
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,679
can start off with really not spending a

1340
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,000
whole lot of money you don't even need

1341
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,519
the microphone right just just your

1342
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,519
phone but yeah you can definitely get

1343
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:34,039
started with little to no equipment and

1344
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,480
still make some good quality content so

1345
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:39,318
I figured that was worthy of mentioning

1346
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:42,639
as well yeah and and uh also I always

1347
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,279
say to people start with where you from

1348
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,279
where you're at with what you have like

1349
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,839
start from right there you don't have to

1350
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,880
buy new running shoes to start running

1351
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,199
you know you don't need the the the the

1352
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,160
fancy stuff to start doing it when I

1353
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,639
started doing comedy

1354
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:01,318
I didn't

1355
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,480
uh I didn't have anyone to do the SK the

1356
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,599
skits with

1357
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,599
me so what I ended up doing instead of

1358
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,119
uh you know beating myself up over it or

1359
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,798
not doing the sketch that I wanted to do

1360
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:13,960
is I started dressing up as different

1361
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:16,159
people you know sort of kind of what I

1362
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,119
do now in my channel you know how that

1363
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,279
that transferred over I would play

1364
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,559
different characters I would play my mom

1365
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,519
I'll play myself you know and just set

1366
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,519
up the cameras and just record myself

1367
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,358
that's how I started once those videos

1368
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:31,559
started going viral everybody wanted to

1369
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,880
be in my videos famous people wanted to

1370
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,359
be in my videos I couldn't get enough

1371
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,039
people in my videos so you know and it

1372
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:39,558
just started because I just didn't have

1373
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:41,880
anything else so you start with where

1374
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,079
you're at with the idea and that forces

1375
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,559
you if anything to be more creative

1376
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,960
because you don't have the fancy

1377
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,280
equipment you got to figure it out and

1378
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,960
figuring it out is what's going to make

1379
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,599
you different Look at me now I'm the one

1380
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,280
dressing like this because I don't have

1381
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:59,960
the people but I'm now now I'm the guy

1382
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,640
now I'm the guy you know I made it work

1383
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:05,039
so uh don't think of your situation as a

1384
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:07,639
disadvantage think of it as an

1385
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,440
opportunity to be creative and show who

1386
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:11,039
you really are great point and bring

1387
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,679
your own style right I mean you have

1388
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,798
your own style that you brought to the

1389
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,239
table you put yourself out there you

1390
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:19,599
didn't copy anybody right I think that's

1391
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,798
uh people get themselves in this

1392
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,920
situation to where they're trying to

1393
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,239
copy somebody because they see oh

1394
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,039
somebody else's success well let me do

1395
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,479
what they're doing I've probably about a

1396
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,558
half a dozen people copy the way that I

1397
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,719
do interviews and that's fine you know I

1398
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,200
I appreciate that I'm humbled that

1399
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,879
somebody was inspired by my work and

1400
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:39,598
wanted to want to copy the way that I do

1401
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,039
it but um people quickly quit because

1402
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,559
it's not them you know they're not

1403
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,960
having fun creating content the way that

1404
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:48,839
somebody else is creating content right

1405
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,639
so do what you want to do your own style

1406
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,599
and have fun with it I think those are

1407
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,440
good ways to go about it I mean gez you

1408
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,960
even went to uh you even went so far to

1409
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,440
create parody videos right he created

1410
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,199
one on me on my

1411
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,559
Chanel yeah so so that's actually a

1412
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,039
great segue for that because you know

1413
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,240
the reason I was trying to get on on

1414
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,558
your Channel at that point was because

1415
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,159
because of how suppressed you feel and

1416
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,319
and when you're making content and

1417
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:17,078
you're putting all these hours and no

1418
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:19,798
one's watching your content so I'm like

1419
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:21,400
man like this guy has a platform you

1420
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:23,480
know let me figure out a way to get

1421
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,039
there so I just reached out to you and

1422
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,798
unfortunately you were booked till next

1423
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,759
year

1424
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,880
and uh and and I said well you know what

1425
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:34,760
I still want it and there you go back to

1426
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,358
use what you have I have myself so I

1427
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,280
disguised me as you and interviewed me

1428
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:42,400
as you you know I made it work I still

1429
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,000
did what I needed to do I didn't do it

1430
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,720
with you but I still did it you know so

1431
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,159
don't ever let your situation limit you

1432
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,358
if you have a great idea you know it's

1433
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:53,759
going to work try it out with whatever

1434
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:56,119
you have around you that's going to make

1435
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,000
it stand out even more and the and the

1436
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,519
cool part about this is that I'm now

1437
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,318
here with you in real life you know what

1438
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:07,920
I mean like with episode 11 the same one

1439
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:09,558
the same number as the Parry that I did

1440
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,639
I thought that was a great that was

1441
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,559
awesome I had to do it yeah I had to do

1442
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,759
episode 118 because that was what it was

1443
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,559
in the parody so I thought that was like

1444
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,559
fitting for that to happen but yeah my

1445
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,359
my list of you'd be surprised there's at
