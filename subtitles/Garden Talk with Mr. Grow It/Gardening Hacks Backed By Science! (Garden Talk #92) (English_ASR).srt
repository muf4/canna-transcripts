1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
coming up on Garden talk mother plants

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,620
aren't the same as production plants you

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,660
have a different strategy there we don't

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,059
want too much nitrogen

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,820
too much nitrogen depletes the stored

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,500
carbohydrates in the plant it'll slow

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,359
down rooting when you take the cutting

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,219
if you wait until the plants are

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,840
suffering they're turning brown and

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,879
dying say oh let me just add some of

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,618
this it's not going to magically bring

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,299
them back maybe they'll come back a

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:28,859
little sooner than they would have but

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,320
really you want to do it before the

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,359
stress happens if you've dissected your

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,859
soil after a grow you'll see that

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,299
there's pockets of roots where the water

18
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,159
was flowing in their pockets where

19
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,899
there's no roots at all with the Yucca

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,359
would be more even sponge of roots

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,920
Nature has all the answers this isn't

22
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,899
anything new they have all the answers

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,160
if you know where to look and then if

24
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,439
you can work with nature in an

25
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,099
intelligent way now you're a gardener

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,660
Growers course a few years back

120
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,339
excellent course I learned so much and

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm excited to have you on here today so

122
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,060
I can pick your brain a little bit but

123
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,860
first can you tell us a little bit about

124
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,339
yourself and how you got into gardening

125
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,400
sure I'm Harley Smith as you introduced

126
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,198
right now I'm today I'm the chief

127
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,478
science officer for commercial

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,379
production facility Total Health

129
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:52,139
cultivation in Michigan but I started

130
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,379
back in 1995.

131
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:58,680
uh almost getting close to 30 years ago

132
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:01,620
and back then I was a video producer I

133
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,360
wasn't a gardener I was making videos on

134
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,620
science and technology

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,500
and I was hired by a company called

136
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,079
Superior Growers Supply and they asked

137
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,899
me to produce a video introduction to

138
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,019
Hydroponics for schools

139
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:22,079
so I knew nothing but by the time I

140
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,219
finished the series I knew enough that I

141
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,918
knew that there's something to this

142
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,900
Hydroponics I really got hooked I knew

143
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,819
it was a great way to teach the science

144
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,319
that knew that there was a great need

145
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,538
for it especially here in the United

146
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,759
States because we were so far behind the

147
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:38,639
rest of the world so I ended up getting

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,220
in as a career of working with schools

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,079
setting up Hydroponics Labs all over the

150
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,419
United States doing professional

151
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,300
development workshops for agriculture

152
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,339
teachers about Hydroponics I was showing

153
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,579
people how to improve the nutritional

154
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:56,459
quality of food and improve the plant's

155
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,740
natural resistance to pests and disease

156
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,019
and I got quite the reputation

157
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,180
in fact I got such a reputation for

158
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,060
knowing the science that I finally got

159
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,038
the white jacket I was hired by a

160
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,978
fertilizer manufacturer in Michigan to

161
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,418
be their director of research in this

162
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,060
that's just the beginning of the story

163
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,639
and it goes on don't ever forget the

164
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,079
most important part along the way I got

165
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,900
my first grow light

166
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,659
an oscillating fan and started growing

167
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,620
tomatoes and herbs in my basement and

168
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,139
then

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,759
that's where the real journey began it

170
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,740
wasn't just doing the research and

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,500
interviewing NASA scientists and

172
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,600
Educators it was actually Hands-On and

173
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,699
that's where a little trial and error

174
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
made some of those rookie mistakes and

175
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,720
maybe today that we we could help new

176
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,879
other Growers avoid making the same

177
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520
mistakes that we probably made early on

178
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,800
a trial and error turned into trial and

179
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,959
success and here we are still standing

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,300
so pretty significant background there

181
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,279
you've been doing this for a very very

182
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,680
long time and I know from taking your

183
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:02,159
master gross course you know a lot about

184
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,978
chemistry and chemistry really combines

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,419
with gardening quite a bit and I'm sure

186
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:08,459
we're going to get into quite a bit of

187
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,740
chemistry as we go on here today but

188
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,599
let's start with clones can you talk to

189
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,879
us about things that can be done to help

190
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,160
clones root and maybe anything else we

191
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,418
need to know about clones rule number

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,660
one

193
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:24,719
healthy moms healthy clones

194
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,319
you have to have strong healthy mother

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,720
plants and it mother plants aren't the

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,759
same as production plants if you have a

197
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,620
different strategy there we don't want

198
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,080
too much nitrogen

199
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,899
too much nitrogen depletes the stored

200
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,000
carbohydrates in the plant it'll slow

201
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:45,899
down rooting when you take the cutting

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,439
so first rule reduce the nitrogen to the

203
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:52,379
low end of sufficiency for moms and then

204
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,079
it improved the uptake of calcium

205
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,639
because if the calcium forms the glue

206
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,800
that glues the cell walls together you

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,379
get a stronger vascular system the plant

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,478
takes up and distributes all of the

209
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,899
Essential Elements more efficiently so

210
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,839
they all build up in into the into the

211
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,339
tissue so you take the cutting

212
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:14,219
separating it from the mom it has to

213
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,679
depend on the stored carbohydrates and

214
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,639
water and nutrients that are in that

215
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,360
cutting

216
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,519
so if you have a strong healthy mom lots

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,759
of stored carbohydrates it'll root

218
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,139
faster and and afterwards now another

219
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,538
thing you can do

220
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,120
once you start to get the initial

221
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:36,538
rooting early on those initial roots

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,620
coming out you can add some kelp

223
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,338
extracts

224
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,259
and kelp has auxins in cytokine kinens

225
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,080
that will stimulate more lateral root

226
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,720
growth and more root mess so first this

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
is the material itself that's the most

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,480
important and then you can do some

229
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,579
things to help the plant take up

230
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,860
nutrients and get a good strong Health

231
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,200
Head Start I know some people are going

232
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,820
to cut their clones at a certain angle

233
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,620
for example they say that that helps

234
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,899
with rooting is there anything to back

235
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,120
that or is that just something that

236
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,458
maybe somebody picked up tried out

237
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,278
thought that I rooted faster but may not

238
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,500
actually root faster it's it's not a

239
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,019
huge difference

240
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,200
but I do I cut on a 45 degree angle

241
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,820
simply because it gives an oval so you

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,100
get a little more surface area for the

243
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,620
roots but you could cut it straight

244
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,300
across and you'll still get rooting but

245
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,179
you know there's something to it but

246
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,639
it's relatively insignificant I know

247
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:36,359
some people that will even scrape the

248
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:40,019
the outer bark a little bit just to uh

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,959
to show more of the surface area of that

250
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,379
Precambrian layer

251
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,659
but who has the time to do that on large

252
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,039
scale yeah me as a home grower I've done

253
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,360
that before where I kind of scraped out

254
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,879
the sides a little bit to help with the

255
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,399
rooting and that definitely has worked

256
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,379
for me in the past so yeah it is

257
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,539
beneficial but if the mother plant has

258
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,299
deficiencies or it's all stressed out

259
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,159
it's not a good thing to take clones

260
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,379
from and that's why I kind of want to

261
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,000
get into next is stress tolerance of

262
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,700
plants what are some things that

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,179
gardeners can do to improve plant stress

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,000
tolerance okay well

265
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,919
I think the number one thing is this is

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,019
where biostimulants come in

267
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,338
and to play not just the nutrients

268
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,100
themselves

269
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,459
but Virginia Tech for example did a

270
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,220
10-year study on biostimulants and they

271
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,199
found that a combination of five parts

272
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,980
humic acid

273
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,100
human phobic to two parts kelp five to

274
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,320
two ratio work 50 percent more

275
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,139
effectively than either one and one of

276
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,540
the things that that combination did is

277
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,539
it stimulated the plant to make 50

278
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:54,480
percent more of an enzyme

279
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:57,059
called superoxide dismutase that

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,480
protects the plant against stress heat

281
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,059
stress salt stress UV stress

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,379
plant will stay green longer recover

283
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:08,099
faster

284
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,958
so that would be a key if the plants but

285
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,860
the best way to do that is before the

286
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,539
stress

287
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,539
because you're making plant protection

288
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,519
agents to protect against the stress if

289
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,500
you wait until the plants are suffering

290
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,419
they're turning brown and dying say oh

291
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,339
let me just add some of this it's not

292
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,838
going to magically bring them back maybe

293
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,880
they'll come back a little sooner than

294
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,579
they would have but really you want to

295
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,100
do it before the stress happens

296
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:36,120
and should that be applied as like a

297
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:40,139
soil drench or foliar or either Ah

298
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,360
that's good if stage zero of cloning is

299
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,659
doing a foliar spray with that same

300
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,379
thing the kill the the humic

301
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:52,019
orophobic I like either one I kind of

302
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,778
prefer phobic for foliar

303
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:58,078
over humic humic morph for the soil

304
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:59,939
pulvic more for hydro or for the and add

305
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,359
a little bit of Yucca extracts as a

306
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,940
wetting agent to it a very small amount

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,060
so that the water doesn't beat up on the

308
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,459
surface spreads out in the film so two

309
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:15,179
weeks before you take cuttings do a

310
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:18,000
light mist with the kelp fulvic acid

311
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:20,819
little Yucca that's all it takes but

312
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,639
don't do it any more than once a week at

313
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,620
the most once every two or three weeks

314
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,679
even will have a noticeable beneficial

315
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,679
effect on the plant so it will help

316
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,919
the plant literally pull nutrients into

317
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,620
those tissues pull in the sugars and the

318
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,240
nutrients so their store the battery is

319
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,519
fully charged

320
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,039
so yeah you can use that at the roots

321
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,200
because you get more root mess there's a

322
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,179
sponge to take up water and minerals and

323
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,519
then you take use it at the surface on

324
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,919
the leaf to pull the nutrients the

325
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,959
cytokine is literally pull the nutrients

326
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,958
into the tissue so you got to push from

327
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,000
The Roots pull from the leaves lots of

328
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,799
beneficial Trace elements too you're

329
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,899
adding

330
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,019
yeah if you have a healthy mom along the

331
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,778
way you are going to see a very high

332
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,220
percentage of rooting and there'll be

333
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,100
shorter period of time than normal

334
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,600
that's a great tip you mentioned Yucca

335
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,579
and I think a lot of people are probably

336
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,139
watching this I have a lot of beginner

337
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,458
and intermediate folks I'm sure there's

338
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,620
some people out there that haven't even

339
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,939
heard of what Yucca is can we get a

340
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,700
little bit deeper into that I know you

341
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,519
wrote an article for maximum yield all

342
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,320
about Yucca and uh you know what is

343
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,320
Yucca and what are the benefits of using

344
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,879
it by the way you can go to the archives

345
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,220
the maximum yield

346
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,679
if you do Harley Smith

347
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,060
maximum yield you'll they'll show a lot

348
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,159
of my articles you could probably read

349
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,979
the whole article but Yucca is a desert

350
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,360
plant and The Roots can be used to make

351
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,000
an extract

352
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,459
which is has opponents in it kind of

353
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,179
soapy

354
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,879
and

355
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:00,958
it's a natural fungicide

356
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:04,220
and natural wetting agent both the

357
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,138
plants themselves will make saponins

358
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,379
uh as they're as a plant protection

359
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:13,079
agent against fungi attaches like like a

360
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,679
steroid steroid like attaches to the

361
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:20,039
cell walls of a fungus in it deactivates

362
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:23,278
it so butt plants makes opponents Yucca

363
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,958
is rich in saponins so it makes uh so

364
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,659
it's beneficial as a wedding agent so

365
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,759
the water will spread out in a thin film

366
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,639
on the leaf

367
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,819
when you add that and uh so it's more

368
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,539
easily and efficiently absorbed and it

369
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:43,320
doesn't beat up into and just make spots

370
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,899
on the leaves and it has a fungicidal

371
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,600
properties to it too even though it's

372
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,179
not a fungicide in itself although they

373
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,820
tested it over in Europe they've cut

374
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,939
back on copper fungicides in the fields

375
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,139
because it's heavy metal and it's

376
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,639
contaminating the groundwater in the

377
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,740
soil so they were looking for

378
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,759
Alternatives they did one study on

379
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,919
apples

380
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,559
where they just used Yucca and water

381
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,078
only into the spray and it was just as

382
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:14,278
effective as the chemical fungicide

383
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,500
so it's also biodegradable

384
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,519
so it's because it's just a natural

385
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,659
chemical

386
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,459
made by plants so as a I like it as a as

387
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,679
a foliar but you can also if you make

388
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,479
that foliar spray and you spray it you

389
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,879
have some left over don't put it on the

390
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,500
Shelf it'll go bad because it's very

391
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,600
biologically active

392
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,519
it'll be a feed the microbes so you

393
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,560
don't really want it on the Shelf have

394
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,620
any leftover use it at the roots the

395
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,479
Yucca also will help the water disperse

396
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,720
through the root Zone especially in

397
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,639
growing mediums in soil so the water and

398
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,220
the nutrients and the biostimulants get

399
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,079
to all the developing root hairs

400
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,720
around the edge of the pot doesn't just

401
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,599
go in and flow through and go out down

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,940
the drain it spreads out disperses yeah

403
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,620
from my understanding it can be very

404
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,920
beneficial if you have a soil that's

405
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,959
gone hydrophobic so uh it helps you know

406
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,179
as a wetting agent helps re-wet that

407
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,559
soil or we free moisten that soil I

408
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,479
guess you could say now my question is

409
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,518
is this would this also be considered a

410
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,620
surfactant yes

411
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,799
it's a natural surfactant

412
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,440
sort of like like soap would be

413
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,120
in fact it is a little soapy

414
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,740
but you can see it I mean if you'd want

415
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,139
to do an experiment you could take a

416
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,539
piece of wax paper and have a drop of

417
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,039
water or some nutrients and one and the

418
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,319
one with the yuck in it and just put

419
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,698
them side by side one will make a little

420
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,040
beat up like a puddle the other will

421
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,500
just spread out like a film

422
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,778
and having it spell like a film in the

423
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,059
root Zone that's a good thing

424
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:47,159
otherwise if water just follows the same

425
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,739
path we did the last time you watered it

426
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,778
around the edge or down through and it

427
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,959
builds up some pockets of salt and it

428
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:57,179
really if you dissected your soil after

429
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,919
a grill you'll see that there's pockets

430
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,299
of roots where the water was flowing in

431
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,278
their pockets where there's no roots at

432
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,159
all but with the Yucca would be more

433
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:08,519
even sponge of roots yeah I use I've

434
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,939
been using Yucca and I actually left the

435
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,199
bag open and it hardened up so are you

436
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,240
saying that is there like a shelf life

437
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,279
on it or can I just like re-crush it up

438
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,019
and then put it into water and mix it up

439
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,759
you could re-crush it it's very

440
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,199
very

441
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,720
hydroscopic is that it where it attracts

442
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,039
the water right that Hydrophobia because

443
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,038
the hydroscopic so if I get a bag of

444
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,619
Yucca the first thing I do is I take it

445
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,359
out of the bag and put it in a glass you

446
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,038
know I can get a really good seal on it

447
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,719
and you could probably even put a dust

448
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,419
skin in it too if you want to have a

449
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,940
last a long time on the Shelf but once

450
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,980
it gets wet it doesn't go bad it just

451
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,440
makes it really hard to work with and

452
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,380
you're using such a small amount it's

453
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,900
like a sixteenth of a teaspoon for five

454
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,140
gallons of water it's hard for me to I

455
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,000
just do a few grains of it put it in for

456
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,919
a quart of foliar spray shake it up

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,440
it'll start foaming

458
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,600
it doesn't take I can't even measure how

459
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,279
small a monthly you need to add so you

460
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,139
can scrape a little off of if it's

461
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,000
hardened up a bit scrape it a little bit

462
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,220
and then put it in it would work how

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,679
that makes sense and for the folks that

464
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,079
are using it as a soil drench can you

465
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,780
overdo it I know some people are using

466
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,339
it every single time they water their

467
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,980
soil they're putting a little bit of

468
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:31,439
yucker in there is that bad at all or is

469
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,200
that perfectly fine there's limits I

470
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,179
don't know what that limit is

471
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,558
um you can overdo it

472
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:42,900
but um just remember it dilute dilute

473
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,660
just take a small amount it'd be I've

474
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,798
never used enough that it hurt did any

475
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,279
harm at all

476
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,418
so um but theoretically you could do an

477
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,178
overdose of just about anything

478
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,160
including yoga okay good to know let's

479
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,320
flip it up let's talk about amino acids

480
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,538
so talk to us about amino acids and how

481
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,178
they can be useful well now you're

482
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:05,220
getting to the heart of my r d I don't

483
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,259
know why I got the jacket

484
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,259
um quick story

485
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:13,319
back in the year 2000 remember the story

486
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:16,740
from the class back in the year 2000 the

487
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,839
Dutch government made all synthetic

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,640
fungicides illegal

489
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,699
on food crops

490
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,679
because all of those fungicides had at

491
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,319
least the potential for negative side

492
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,700
effects on on human beings so they said

493
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,859
nope can't use it got to protect the

494
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,740
environment got to protect people from

495
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:39,599
the fungicides so overnight the

496
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,640
Netherlands cool overcast very assist in

497
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,980
the greenhouses very susceptible to

498
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,020
powdery mildew and mold this naturally

499
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,319
cold and damp

500
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:51,900
so the Growers started losing a large

501
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,538
proportion 40 percent of their crop to

502
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,400
powdery mildew gray mold so they had to

503
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:59,759
do something so they started they got

504
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,240
hold of some of the biostimulant product

505
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:06,900
from Germany coming out of Germany

506
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,640
that had some promising side effects to

507
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,860
use on plants

508
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,500
in 2001

509
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:16,740
I was invited to the Netherlands to

510
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,839
Amsterdam to visit to all the schools

511
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,538
the agricultural schools over there but

512
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,359
also to visit the greenhouses that were

513
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:27,839
doing the first trials with that organic

514
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:30,719
biostimulant Eco one highest level of of

515
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,240
Organics I got to interview the Dutch

516
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,980
grower who is doing the tug trials for

517
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,640
the Dutch government

518
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,339
he went from losing 40 of his crop to

519
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,120
losing zero

520
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,558
he got a 10 increase in yield over any

521
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,619
past year

522
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:52,019
and he was first in the line for sugar

523
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:54,659
content in the fruit he was growing the

524
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,160
best of the best it was actually that

525
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,980
particular grower was a strawberry

526
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,440
grower strawberries are very susceptible

527
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,298
to polyure mildew and mold so that was

528
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,820
kind of the torture test

529
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:08,519
so um I knew there was something to it I

530
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,899
I interviewed the German scientist that

531
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,119
that produced it

532
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,059
as mobizen he wouldn't tell me it took

533
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,798
about 10 years of r d on his behalf so

534
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:18,779
he wasn't going to give away his secrets

535
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,179
I came back

536
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,379
it's been four years digging

537
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,740
deep

538
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:29,400
I found it I cracked it it was amino

539
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,579
acids here we go two of the amino acids

540
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,759
glutamic acid and glycine

541
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:39,538
literally stimulate root cells to open

542
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,700
calcium ion channels

543
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,640
so instead of the plant taking in one

544
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,919
Ion at a time of calcium and then taken

545
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,280
it up in the plant they open the Ion

546
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,740
channel A Thousand Eye calcium ions tens

547
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,379
of thousands flow into the plant and are

548
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,419
taken up calcium there's the glue that

549
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,179
glues the cell walls together the plant

550
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,679
takes up more calcium

551
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,679
instead of the water in the interstitial

552
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,179
space you have calcium pectate pectin

553
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,960
the glue that glues the cell walls

554
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,960
together

555
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,579
when a mold Spore lands on a leaf it

556
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,179
doesn't germinate in the surface water

557
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:18,058
you could just spray it wash the spores

558
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:21,679
off but the foot is still in the tissue

559
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:25,019
and it comes back but if you use

560
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,400
the amino acids the plant takes up more

561
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,200
calcium

562
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,059
instead of water in the interstitial

563
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,000
Space by the time that mold Spore is

564
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,019
able to penetrate the cells to get to

565
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,900
the water

566
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,298
in the interstitial space and become

567
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,000
established it dries up and dies

568
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:45,418
so it isn't killing fungus it's not a

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,599
fungicide it's improving the plant's

570
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,580
natural resistance to the fungus it

571
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,379
stops it from getting established and

572
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,658
spreading that's why they were able to

573
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,200
reduce the losses to zero because they

574
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,659
never got hot hold now I don't I'm

575
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,538
getting excited about this one but not

576
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:06,360
only is there a physical barrier but the

577
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,819
extra calcium that the plant doesn't use

578
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,979
in the cell walls it will store it in

579
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,500
the vacuole of the plant it stores it up

580
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,200
later if a little bit of powdery mildew

581
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,859
or gray mold or gets a you know on a

582
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,159
leaf the plant recognizes the chitin

583
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:25,199
that's a chemical a chitin in the cell

584
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,280
wall of the fungus plants don't have

585
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,440
chitin

586
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,079
they have cellular cellulose

587
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,659
so it knows it's under attack it the

588
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,939
plant literally sends a signal molecule

589
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,380
from the surface of the cell to the

590
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,840
vacuole

591
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,179
to open up calciums and ion channels

592
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,399
inside the cell and thousands or

593
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,820
millions of calcium ions go into the

594
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,500
cytoplasm it starts to chain reaction

595
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:51,658
the plant starts a chain reaction an

596
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,058
oxidative burst which is the plant's

597
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,780
first line of defense against the fungus

598
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:59,759
or even against some insects so we're

599
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,918
building up a natural resistance of the

600
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,839
plants without using any chemical

601
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,020
fungicides

602
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,298
oh so it's it's revolutionary really

603
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,940
when you think about how much we as

604
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:14,400
Growers lose to mold and mildew anything

605
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,080
that we can do to give the plant a

606
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,980
competitive advantage

607
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:23,099
is is worth it and amino acids equal one

608
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:26,099
highest level of Organic certification

609
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:28,079
they also feed the microbes in the soil

610
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:31,379
you know that's a nitrogen source for

611
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,960
micro microorganisms to eat so it's a

612
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,020
win-win healthy mixed healthier soil

613
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,720
healthier plants I'll also remember your

614
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:43,200
kelp extracts which are very common for

615
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,140
gardeners they have amino acids in them

616
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,720
so some of us there microorganisms in

617
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,059
the soil by the way make amino acids

618
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,159
they make an End digestive enzymes

619
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:55,740
called proteases that break down

620
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,380
proteins into the building blocks of

621
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,960
proteins which are amino acids so they

622
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,220
literally they're making amino acids

623
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,380
right on the surface of the roots

624
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,380
they've been doing it without a store

625
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,419
hydro store for millions of years we're

626
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,220
just working with nature we're just

627
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,980
giving them a little push in the right

628
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,538
direction Nature has all the answers you

629
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,400
know it's not this isn't anything new

630
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:19,619
they have all the answers if you know

631
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,480
where where to look and then if you can

632
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,058
work with nature in an intelligent way

633
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,740
now you're a gardener now I can really

634
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:28,019
do on your job

635
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,058
and it's fun it's fun to see it actually

636
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,220
work let nature do the heavy lifting

637
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,440
right

638
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,700
well one other thing about amino acids I

639
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,460
want to bring up that I learned in your

640
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,500
course was it helps with well water to

641
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,360
prevent lime scale yeah that's that's

642
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,679
right that's true that's how I actually

643
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,859
got on

644
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,440
the clue got the final clue to solve

645
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:53,519
this mystery I have hard water at home

646
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,019
in fact it's very hard water so I could

647
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,500
literally when I added my phosphoric

648
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,960
acid to lower my pH the PH down I could

649
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,659
literally see crystals of calcium

650
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,400
phosphate forming then falling out a

651
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,980
solution like snowflakes

652
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,500
that's how hard it was and I had lime

653
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,659
scale clogging on my pumps and my

654
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,579
emitters on the side of my reservoirs I

655
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,539
couldn't even scrape it out the end of a

656
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,480
girl

657
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:21,839
but amino acids are what are called

658
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,058
chelators intermediate chelators Kila

659
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,599
means claw so they attached to Mineral

660
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:29,579
ions like calcium ions like a claw it

661
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,899
holds it tightly enough so it doesn't

662
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,658
react

663
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,419
doesn't lock up in the soil but Loosely

664
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:39,059
enough so it's released to the plant on

665
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,460
demand so that was my first clue when I

666
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:43,940
got my amino acid blend to work with

667
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,319
from vitamin manufacturer out ease

668
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,940
experimental product

669
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,200
put it in the first thing I noticed no

670
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,120
more lime scale

671
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
oh where did it go at the end of the

672
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,119
grow

673
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,400
instead of trying to scrape all that off

674
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,719
that lime scale off I literally took a

675
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,600
paper towel

676
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,179
wiped a little film of the algae rinsed

677
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:06,178
it with water from the hose it was clean

678
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:10,200
so where did all that calcium go

679
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,778
oh into the plant how did it get there

680
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,700
the amino acids and the calcium there's

681
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:18,538
some relationship there

682
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,038
that was the final clue so I went to

683
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:24,419
Google

684
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:26,220
um I did calcium amino acids and it took

685
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,538
me to some studies where they did latest

686
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,640
studies around the world where they're

687
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,919
doing patched clamp analysis and

688
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,720
learning learning about calcium ion

689
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,159
channels there it was

690
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,259
oh by the way when I went back to the

691
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,720
Netherlands a few years later for

692
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,940
another Tour on bio bio filters for

693
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,700
cleaning water naturally

694
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,500
but I was over there I told both the

695
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,778
research I was doing with the seven

696
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,220
primary amino acid chelates

697
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,659
they told me I knew more about their

698
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,179
product than they did

699
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:56,580
and they were pumping me for information

700
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:58,500
so yeah the amino acids they not only

701
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:00,839
chelate the calcium to keep it more

702
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,759
available from locking up but it also

703
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,740
stimulates the uptake of calcium and

704
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,440
plants do that naturally with the help

705
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,259
of especially with the help of

706
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,360
microorganisms in the soil oh and you

707
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,700
don't need you know there's a lot of of

708
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,459
amino acid products on the market now

709
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,960
and I think people have learned from me

710
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,759
along the way and some of the

711
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,819
manufacturers are adding amino acids

712
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,259
right to their nutrients so it's out

713
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,058
there just need to know where to look

714
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,099
definitely beneficial information for

715
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,658
those folks that are in Hydroponics or

716
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,939
even using just a reservoir and have

717
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,679
that lime scale being able to add in the

718
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,659
amino acids and get rid of that is is

719
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,019
huge I want to get a little bit deeper

720
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:41,880
into water particularly kind of chlorine

721
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:44,579
in water there's a lot of misinformation

722
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,559
out there unfortunately but um you know

723
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:49,199
if there is chlorine in the water

724
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,298
I'd like to know what harm does chlorine

725
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,460
do to the plants and what can gardeners

726
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,960
do to get rid of the chlorine yeah

727
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,980
there's there's two different forms of

728
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,919
chlorine

729
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,798
the Municipal Water Supplies you know

730
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,140
one was more of a chlorine type gas

731
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,379
that's used to kill microorganisms

732
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,500
harmful organisms in the in the water

733
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:13,320
and it can at high levels it can damage

734
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,980
root microscopic root hairs because it's

735
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,658
an oxidizer you know it's

736
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:22,140
killing the bacteria but also harming

737
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,480
The Roots especially at high levels now

738
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,759
chloramine is a more recalcitrant it

739
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,700
lasts longer in the water

740
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,379
uh according to the EPA though it's not

741
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,038
harmful to plants

742
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,919
or to people but it is harmful to fish

743
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,179
and microorganisms now if you want to

744
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,220
get rid of both you want to get rid of

745
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,960
the chlorine well if you want to just

746
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,940
get rid of chlorine you know that's the

747
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,980
only that's the only thing in the in the

748
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,380
Municipal Water just have a side

749
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,380
Reservoir and let the water sit

750
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,000
overnight the chlorine gas will just

751
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,399
dissipate into the air

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,380
put a bubbler in there it'll dissipate a

753
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,000
little faster so that's all you need but

754
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,640
if you have the chloramines they're not

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,839
going to dissipate but you can get an

756
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,600
activated charcoal filter it's not an RO

757
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,480
filter it's an activated charcoal filter

758
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,058
and there's some that are designed to

759
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,179
remove the chlorine and the chloramines

760
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:19,558
from the water so if you're if you're

761
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,659
hesitant and if you're going to make

762
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,038
compost tea you want to get rid of the

763
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,140
chlorine you don't want it to kill the

764
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,960
beneficial microorganisms in the compost

765
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,000
tea so you know just an activated

766
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,159
charcoal filter will do the job I think

767
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,319
a lot of people are concerned uh that

768
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,419
are growing in living soil and rely on

769
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,918
those microbes in the soil in order to

770
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,960
break down the Amendments so the plant

771
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,419
can uptake them they're concerned that

772
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,720
the chlorine levels in their tap water

773
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,520
is killing off all their microbes now on

774
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,919
the opposite side some people the

775
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,440
argument towards that is that once it's

776
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,919
released from the actual faucet the

777
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,720
chlorine level isn't going to do harm to

778
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,820
the microbes what's your take on that

779
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,319
it'll do harm

780
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,398
you know he'll do harm until it's

781
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,398
dissipated enough

782
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,159
I've I've done it I mean we've looked at

783
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,798
it under the microscope where you have

784
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,960
had some compost tea

785
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,940
and then we took and then we mixed up

786
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,278
another batch with the head the city

787
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,778
water and you could just see that they

788
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,538
weren't swimming around they're they're

789
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:22,980
sluggish the microbes are sluggish or

790
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:26,278
they're they're not even or they just

791
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,558
die with the chlorinated water but I

792
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,419
guess it depends on where you are

793
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,918
in general I don't think I mean I've

794
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,038
grown plants

795
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,980
for years in the city in this in the

796
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,679
store with City water never had problems

797
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,380
but once in a while you'll get a problem

798
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,940
with the water supply you get a heavy

799
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,399
water you get a little flooding in the

800
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,380
spring you get some backup of the sewers

801
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,798
and stuff and what they'll they'll do is

802
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,380
they'll they'll charge it with the high

803
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,058
levels of chlorine to to make it safe

804
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,159
and but they don't tell you

805
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:01,678
oh you know we just added 10 times as

806
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,200
much chlorine to your water and then at

807
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,059
that high level and you know it's going

808
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,819
to hurt your plants it'll it'll stunt

809
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,798
them you know they should grow back you

810
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:12,898
know I've used really high levels of

811
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,839
hydrogen peroxide on plants that have

812
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:18,178
root rot and you know it's stunning them

813
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,699
but they go in The Roots came back so

814
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,259
it's not one of these oh it's you know

815
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,960
yes or no but if you're gonna do compost

816
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:27,778
tea you should either use spring water

817
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,360
or at least let your water sit overnight

818
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,500
in a side Reservoir another it's good to

819
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,819
let it warm up to room temperature

820
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,640
anyway

821
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:38,038
I always recommend a side Reservoir and

822
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,840
hydroponics so the day before I do my

823
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,220
reservoir change I fill up my side

824
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,859
garbage can

825
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,100
with with my tap with my water and then

826
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:49,798
the next day I pump out my reservoir

827
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:52,079
take the pump put it back in the in the

828
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,418
side Reservoir fill it refill it it's

829
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,519
room temperature it's clean we're ready

830
00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:00,538
to start a new crop because it's easy

831
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,158
fast and and it works well

832
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:04,200
so

833
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
uh you should do it and if you wanted to

834
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,700
to warm up the water a little quicker

835
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,980
you can put a submersible heater in your

836
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,798
side Reservoir to let it warm up quick

837
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,298
more quickly not a bit not a huge thing

838
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:17,579
but

839
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,740
I remember when I first started I

840
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:22,619
remember doing my reservoir changes and

841
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,778
bailing out the water with buckets

842
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:26,759
and after you know man what a pain it is

843
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,159
to do that take them down dump them and

844
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,359
get another bucket take a dumb bump dump

845
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,880
it up

846
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,158
how easy is this to put some submersible

847
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,278
pump a water mover with a hose

848
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,440
you know a simple water mover you can

849
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,140
get at Home Depot and have that whole

850
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,659
job done in five minutes

851
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,580
but with the side Reservoir you can

852
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,559
replace it with room temperature water

853
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:52,079
that's clean and free of chlorine

854
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:56,220
definitely makes it so much easier where

855
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:59,339
I live my city tap water comes in at 485

856
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,960
PPM so it's extremely high I don't even

857
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,759
use it because I've tried to use it on

858
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,278
Plants before and like they were not

859
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,519
happy with it so I ended up investing in

860
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,739
a RO system so now I use RO water I know

861
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,300
there's some people that have tried to

862
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,459
use a water salt they have a water

863
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,019
softener and they try to use that water

864
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,000
can you talk to us about the downsides

865
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:20,579
of that

866
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,199
yeah don't use the water softener unless

867
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,119
you change your salt

868
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,638
in your water softener

869
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,159
what a water softener does is it takes

870
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,820
the calcium and magnesium out of the

871
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,700
water and replaces it with sodium you

872
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:39,899
know salt is sodium chloride but you get

873
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:41,699
up above 50 parts per million of sodium

874
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:43,618
and the plants aren't going to reach

875
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,439
their genetic potential

876
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,300
so I mean if you have a hundred parts

877
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,338
120 parts per million of calcium and you

878
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,800
replace it with 120 parts per million of

879
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:57,299
sodium that's a bad day for your plant

880
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,500
so I bypassed that the uh on my water

881
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,119
softener or I've done this in the winter

882
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,059
where instead of using the regular

883
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,760
Morton salt sodium chloride there's

884
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,739
another type of Morton salt that's

885
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,320
potassium chloride

886
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:15,719
it's more expensive than sodium chloride

887
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,720
but then you're replacing the calcium

888
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:20,459
magnesium with potassium and potassium

889
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,259
is actually a fertilizer for the plant

890
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,760
it's the health element so you're doing

891
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,160
something good for your plants so I've

892
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,720
done that if I had to use the water

893
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,940
softener I would

894
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,379
yeah I would use the potassium chloride

895
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,338
salt

896
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:37,079
our o is great I love it but once I

897
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:39,059
learned about how to

898
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,820
turn my lemons into lemonade and get

899
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,920
more calcium uptake I haven't used my RO

900
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,220
filter unless I just want to top off the

901
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,858
reservoir you know with some fresh water

902
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:52,858
uh the RO water by itself does have has

903
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:55,559
no buffer so the pH can swing pretty

904
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,358
wildly so I'm personally I like to have

905
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,639
a combination if you're going to use it

906
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,460
a combination of tap water

907
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,980
and you know it's room temperature and

908
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,800
RO water so you have some buffer there

909
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,260
let's get deeper into pH what is the

910
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,300
optimal PH range for medicinal plants

911
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,200
and you mentioned buffer what are some

912
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:20,460
ways to buffer the pH okay a good PH

913
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,919
range safe 5.8 to 6.4 it's always been

914
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,139
the sweet spot I let it drift between

915
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,300
the two I don't try to get the perfect

916
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:30,719
pH all the time when I change the

917
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,780
reservoir I typically shoot for 6.0

918
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:37,019
some Growers will shoot for 5.8 either

919
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,480
one is good I just like 6-0 because when

920
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,659
I use the pH test kit

921
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,000
like the GH pH test indicator solution

922
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,699
if it's 6.0 when you're doing your test

923
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,400
it's dandelion yellow easiest color to

924
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:52,679
see so I can see if it's perfectly

925
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,039
yellow or just a little yellowish green

926
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,379
or just a little yellowish Amber and I

927
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:01,139
can dial it in pretty simply so I just

928
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,619
go for six hours being my my target but

929
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:07,858
5.8 is good too is that for Hydroponics

930
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:11,820
as well as soilless Medias as well as

931
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:15,598
soil soil you can go a little bit higher

932
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,180
in PH you can go more like 6.5 is a good

933
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,599
Target but it can go up to 6.8 you know

934
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:23,879
in that area because

935
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,760
microorganisms that's the the closer to

936
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,019
neutral is better for the microbes in

937
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,839
the soil

938
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:34,199
so that's their favorite and as the

939
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:37,078
microorganisms are colonizing the roots

940
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,838
they are making organic acids that lower

941
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,119
the ph right on the surface of the root

942
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:45,000
Zone it could be two points lower than

943
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,700
the surrounding bulk soil so you can go

944
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,739
a little bit higher

945
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,739
also your with soil you're going to want

946
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,299
to adjust your pH of your soil before

947
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:57,479
you even start

948
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:00,240
and once it's your pH is of your soil is

949
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,358
right it's buffered it's hard to change

950
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,699
the pH one way or the other so the pH of

951
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,159
the water that you're watering with

952
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:10,500
isn't as important anymore

953
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,299
because the pH is right there where the

954
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,940
plants want it

955
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,400
but with Hydroponics you know you want

956
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,700
to try to you know water is not a buffer

957
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,280
for pH so it's really easy to change pH

958
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:25,559
of water and hydroponics

959
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,440
host you're talking about buffering uh

960
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,299
if you want to add some buffering

961
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,039
capacity to your Ro so you don't have

962
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,440
the wild swings

963
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:37,679
spiking and crashing pH

964
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,619
just add a little like I said add 50 50.

965
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,838
tap water to your Ro you're adding some

966
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,780
some buffering capacity some calcium

967
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,759
carbonate magnesium carbonates you're

968
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,099
adding some beneficial Trace elements

969
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,260
that that are good for spring water has

970
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,440
some illness from the earth with it as

971
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,440
well

972
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,119
um and or you could add a small amount

973
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,159
of humic acid to it if you have that on

974
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,900
yourself that will add some buffering

975
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,618
capacity too

976
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,579
um

977
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:12,000
in soilless mix the humic acid will

978
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:14,579
raise the pH of acid soil it will lower

979
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,338
the pH of alkaline soil so it does have

980
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:19,560
a nice buffering capacity has a lot of

981
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:22,619
positive and negative charges on it to

982
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:26,279
hold and release hydrogen ions and

983
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:29,280
hydroxyl ions so it buffers that makes

984
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,440
sense yeah so in your master Growers

985
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,380
course you mentioned that plants will

986
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,000
produce 18 to 20 percent more essential

987
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,300
oils and hydroponics I'm talking about

988
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,980
you know terpenes cannabinoids why is

989
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,420
that and also is there anything else

990
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,760
that gardeners can do in order to

991
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,639
increase essential oil production yeah

992
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,380
that was one of the very first things I

993
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,838
learned in my research on hydroponics

994
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,519
for that very first video I did for

995
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:56,099
schools on introduction Hydroponics

996
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:00,358
there was a study done it must have been

997
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,579
in in the 80s late 80s on hydroponics to

998
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,500
the University of Minnesota and they're

999
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,900
the ones that discovered you know

1000
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,599
measured it that plants grown in

1001
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:13,559
Hydroponics at 18 to 20 percent more

1002
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,720
aromatic oils than full field grown

1003
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,659
but they didn't really say why

1004
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:21,659
uh I don't really know exactly why what

1005
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:23,460
it was about it but one thing about

1006
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:25,019
Hydroponics all of the essential

1007
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,260
elements are there in the perfect

1008
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:31,858
balance lots of good aeration perfect

1009
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,140
water it really helps the plants reach

1010
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:36,299
their true genetic potential

1011
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:38,819
and part of that genetic potential is

1012
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,619
the production of the terpenes so I

1013
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,200
think that may be why

1014
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,480
just with just Hydroponics alone if

1015
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,179
there was such a difference

1016
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,119
um now to increase terpenes

1017
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:54,179
I found in my I did research on my own

1018
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,760
along the way and found that healthy

1019
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:58,618
stress

1020
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,440
improves the terpene production

1021
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,079
healthy stress it could be well a very

1022
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,579
common one to use is drought stress

1023
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,460
because you can do that toward the end

1024
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:13,380
have have longer periods more dry back

1025
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,820
between when you hold waterings and the

1026
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,579
plant will respond to that and make

1027
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,079
terpenes the other way is salt stress

1028
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,839
with you that's why I love to do in

1029
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,060
Hydroponics because it's easy to just

1030
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,578
raise your your EC the electrical

1031
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,380
conductivity so it's a little bit salty

1032
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,380
makes it a little harder for the plant

1033
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,599
to take up water and then as a response

1034
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,260
they make antioxidants to protect

1035
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:41,160
themselves against the the stress and

1036
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:44,520
some of those are flavonoids and and um

1037
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,858
other molecules and terpenes and I did

1038
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,139
do anything one experiment to approve

1039
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:52,199
that because I kind of knew that I was

1040
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:55,259
taught that early on in my career but I

1041
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:58,139
mixed up some hydroponic nutrients

1042
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,660
three different strengths one was half

1043
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:03,539
strength one was full strength according

1044
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,699
to the directions one was high strength

1045
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,019
and I did side by side in the same

1046
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:09,659
environment

1047
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:12,960
the plants with the highest

1048
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:16,039
strength the highest EC had the the

1049
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,019
darkest colors the richest Aromas

1050
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,699
strongest flavors and I wasn't like oh

1051
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:22,679
yeah I think this is a little bit I mean

1052
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:23,399
it was dramatic difference you can see

1053
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:25,440
it

1054
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,240
you know the three jar side by side you

1055
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,519
could see the different color it's the

1056
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,039
intensity you open up the jar and take a

1057
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,219
sniff you could smell the terpene

1058
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,838
profile and just in your face so I would

1059
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,358
get the highest prices because it was

1060
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:43,078
the highest amount of of vitamins and

1061
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,940
highest amount of of the of the terpenes

1062
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,140
so um

1063
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,519
yeah so that really helped and um when

1064
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,279
it was trying to be more competitive

1065
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,759
with tomatoes I could do the same thing

1066
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,480
I could raise my EC up even higher

1067
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,359
the uh you get 50 more

1068
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,579
of the lycopene content that's the per

1069
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,440
the red pigment

1070
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,640
and you could so it's red all the way

1071
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,220
through

1072
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,759
I could get um

1073
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:16,858
30 percent more vitamin C content just

1074
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,079
by raising the EC because again some of

1075
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:21,719
those vitamins that are manufactured are

1076
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,760
a stress response from the plant

1077
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:25,739
so you don't want to baby them too much

1078
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,480
you know give them some healthy but too

1079
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,879
much stress they can't take up enough

1080
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,500
water to meet their needs and they start

1081
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,380
getting crispy on the edge you get your

1082
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,179
fertilizer burned and it has a negative

1083
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,760
effect on the growth and and

1084
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,618
productivity of the plant

1085
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,680
so if you want to be a great Gardener

1086
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:46,079
learn how to manage stress

1087
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,818
manage the stress of the plant if you go

1088
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,480
a little too high the leaves start to

1089
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:53,159
curl at the ends you give then just back

1090
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,719
off on the stress

1091
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:59,338
yes but if if they're they turn they

1092
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,078
start to curl and turn brown on the edge

1093
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:03,539
you know you're going too far you have

1094
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,460
to you have to make it write a note best

1095
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:07,800
Growers are the best record Keepers do

1096
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,019
not go past this EC

1097
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,780
that's the top line for that particular

1098
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:14,460
strain and just live close to the line

1099
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,019
and your plants will thank you good

1100
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,539
advice yeah I know a lot of people doing

1101
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:21,179
Precision stress methods in order to try

1102
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,219
to increase the terpene profile and uh

1103
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,960
yeah I hear it from so many different

1104
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:28,139
people that it works for them I mean

1105
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,539
just me and my garden wind stress I mean

1106
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:32,818
that that's a thing from I can I can see

1107
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:35,279
the plants that are right next to the

1108
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:37,079
fan that's blowing somewhat harshly

1109
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,760
against it I could see a clear

1110
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,500
difference in trichome production on

1111
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,079
those plants versus the plants that were

1112
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,300
further away so wind stress is a thing

1113
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,400
as well I mean you talked about the

1114
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,019
other ways that you can stress the plant

1115
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,420
in a Precision method in order to

1116
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,818
increase terpenes so that's really good

1117
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,500
to know let's remember and you don't

1118
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:57,000
want to get too much heat stress at the

1119
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,318
very end

1120
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,318
like when they're growing into the

1121
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,440
lights because that will evaporate the

1122
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,759
terpenes too so you'll lose some so you

1123
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,500
know you might want to at the end kind

1124
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,599
of cool it down a little bit to preserve

1125
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,239
the terpene profiles and also that could

1126
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,980
lead to foxtailing right which is a

1127
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,199
characteristic that some people actually

1128
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,300
like but a lot of people find it

1129
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:21,239
undesirable you know and they're they're

1130
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,240
final flowers so yeah he increased heat

1131
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,659
can definitely do that my theory on the

1132
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,739
on the fox tailing is the combination of

1133
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,199
the Heat

1134
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:33,959
and phosphorus

1135
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,719
you know a phosphorus toxicity shows up

1136
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,240
as a zinc deficiency and zinc is

1137
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,779
critical for making the growth hormones

1138
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:45,239
the auxins IAA so if you get too much

1139
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:48,240
phosphorus and too much heat in

1140
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,818
combination then the there it affects

1141
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,098
the hormonal balance of the plants so

1142
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:54,838
instead of the the flower buds filling

1143
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:57,780
in they want to just do more cell

1144
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,219
division and and foxtail out

1145
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,900
but you'll see it if they're further

1146
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:05,578
away from the lights you don't see it as

1147
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:07,380
as much a foxtailing yeah now two

1148
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,480
phosphorus is temperature dependent too

1149
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,700
so if you have cooler temperatures it

1150
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,199
doesn't take up as much phosphorus but

1151
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,480
if you have high temperatures and high

1152
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,639
phosphorus then it's taking up more

1153
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,619
phosphorus too and then it can build up

1154
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,139
the toxic levels in the tissue that's

1155
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,240
interesting I hadn't heard that before

1156
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:25,559
so we talked about increasing terpenes I

1157
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,439
want to kind of flip it over to

1158
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:32,159
increasing yield a common way to do it

1159
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,139
very common is CO2 can you talk to us

1160
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:38,039
about the benefits of supplementing CO2

1161
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:41,219
and what CO2 level is ideal okay oh yeah

1162
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:44,159
I mean the light is the limiting factor

1163
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:47,039
so you want to get the the most light

1164
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,139
best quality light you can to your

1165
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,300
plants and that's a whole other story

1166
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:54,719
I'm getting ready to start some lighting

1167
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,539
trials in a in a facility we just built

1168
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,000
using interlighting and also sub canopy

1169
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:03,000
lighting but you know light is number

1170
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,079
one now once light is no longer the

1171
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,719
limiting factor then CO2 becomes the

1172
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:13,079
limiting factor if you're in a closed

1173
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:15,179
room and the plan to use is up takes in

1174
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,060
the carbon dioxide for photosynthesis

1175
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:20,818
under those lights they can deplete the

1176
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:24,420
CO2 in the room if they deplete it down

1177
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:28,079
to say 200 parts per million the plants

1178
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:31,099
will stop growing so a deficiency of CO2

1179
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,200
is actually worse than the benefit

1180
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:36,119
beneficial effects of increased CO2 so

1181
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,818
at the very least you want fresh air

1182
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,280
coming in to replace the the depleted

1183
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:44,460
CO2 in your room at the very end now on

1184
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,500
the other hand if you increase the CO2

1185
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:50,338
in the atmosphere

1186
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:52,440
to say 700 between 750 and

1187
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:56,639
1500 PPM

1188
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,280
you could see a 50 increase 30 to 50

1189
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:02,879
percent increase in yield easily if you

1190
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,220
have a good light an air movement so

1191
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,280
so yeah but you don't need CO2 at night

1192
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:10,379
only during the day you

1193
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,300
um you don't want to go too high either

1194
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:16,079
if you get up above

1195
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,300
well up above 1500 you're wasting CO2

1196
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,640
the plants will start to close the

1197
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,160
stomata also here's the here's a little

1198
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,279
tip I learned this along the way it's

1199
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,960
better to ramp up your CO2 as well when

1200
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,540
you're going from Veg to bloom and

1201
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,639
you're under heavier production you

1202
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:37,199
don't want to just go from

1203
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,358
400 PPM to 1200 overnight because the

1204
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:43,019
plant will have to adapt to that high

1205
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:45,539
CO2 it'll close the stomata so

1206
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:48,119
until it has a chance to adapt so if you

1207
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:50,099
wrap it up slowly the plants will adapt

1208
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,800
better and they'll respond better to the

1209
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,900
CO2 because if they close their stomata

1210
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,519
then they're not transpiring as much

1211
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,780
they're not taking enough nutrients as

1212
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,338
much you can even get a nutrient

1213
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,500
deficiency

1214
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:05,460
same way if you have excess you get to

1215
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:08,699
say 5 000 parts per million a CO2 it'll

1216
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,500
close up the stomata so much that it can

1217
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:12,358
burn your plants it'll look like

1218
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,400
fertilizer burn the edge of the leaves

1219
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:17,880
will actually turn brown

1220
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,519
you get up to ten thousand or higher

1221
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,440
it's not even good to be in the room

1222
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,420
for an extended period of time as a

1223
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,420
grower you know so there's OSHA

1224
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:32,338
standards there but if you but between I

1225
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,780
think 1200 PPM for the is a good goal a

1226
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:37,259
nice Target

1227
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,200
now in Arizona in the Tomato production

1228
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,599
hydroponic tomato production with all

1229
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:44,539
that light

1230
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,460
you know a cloudless day in the summer

1231
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:50,579
High light intensity they'll go up as

1232
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,338
high as 2000 PPM

1233
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:55,440
during the peak of the day because the

1234
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,400
plant can use it then

1235
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,039
um

1236
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,400
so um yeah I saw that they actually have

1237
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,679
light sensors in the greenhouses that it

1238
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,838
measured the accumulated sunlight for

1239
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,799
the day and the computer will adjust the

1240
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:12,239
CO2 for the prevailing

1241
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,280
conditions environmental conditions

1242
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,139
another thing they do commercially is

1243
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,960
they they need to have heating at night

1244
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:21,480
it's cold in the desert so during the

1245
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,280
day they're they're using the boiler and

1246
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,260
they're producing CO2

1247
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,260
and then they pump the hot water into

1248
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,020
storage tanks insulated tanks at night

1249
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,000
they run that hot water through the

1250
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:35,159
pipes in the greenhouse to warm the root

1251
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,380
Zone and warm the canopy at night so

1252
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,358
they're getting double duty CO2 during

1253
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,579
the day when they need it heat at night

1254
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,440
when they need it that's smart yeah and

1255
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,720
it's very automated as well that's

1256
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,700
awesome very automated there's one other

1257
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,558
thing I want to get into which I think

1258
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:52,739
the audience will gain value from which

1259
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:56,640
is Bricks now you had mentioned that 12

1260
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:59,459
or higher bricks pests won't recognize

1261
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,838
the plant as food so I know there's a

1262
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,059
lot of people listening in they battle

1263
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,219
grow after grow after grow they've got

1264
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,599
pests they're spraying their plants to

1265
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:08,699
prevent pests they're spraying their

1266
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,559
plants when they have pests but they're

1267
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:12,118
not even looking at bricks talk to us

1268
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,500
about bricks what is bricks how do you

1269
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,858
measure it and how do you increase

1270
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,139
bricks okay you know the the organic

1271
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:20,818
gardeners

1272
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:23,159
know know a lot about bricks they've

1273
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,599
been using it for years you

1274
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,239
um now remember

1275
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,579
it's really this bottom line is the

1276
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,739
measurement of the sugar content of the

1277
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:34,680
sap that's the main measurement

1278
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:37,739
uh it also kind of measures the total

1279
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:40,318
dissolved solids as well

1280
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,699
organic elements don't conduct

1281
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,440
electricity

1282
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:46,500
like sugar

1283
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,139
so you can't use an EC meter

1284
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,260
like you would for your measuring your

1285
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:55,078
salts for your fertilizer you just won't

1286
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,240
register on there but the more the total

1287
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,839
dissolved solids and sugar in the water

1288
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:03,539
the more it reflects refracts light

1289
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:07,139
so a refractometer is how you measure it

1290
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:09,420
you take a few drops drops of sap from

1291
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:12,000
the leaf first fully developed Leaf near

1292
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:14,880
the top of the plant you squeeze out a

1293
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,460
two or three drops of sap onto a slide

1294
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,800
of this refractometer look through it

1295
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,079
and you can because it's bending the

1296
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,900
light you can actually read it like a

1297
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,318
thermometer what the bricks level is and

1298
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,460
the goal for me anyway is 12 percent or

1299
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,400
higher

1300
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,800
uh for very healthy it's measuring the

1301
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,420
indicating the the current nutritional

1302
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,720
status of the plant

1303
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,480
so to increase it first thing I do if I

1304
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:45,058
go into a as a consultant go into a room

1305
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,659
or into a greenhouse first thing I'll do

1306
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:51,540
is a Brix test if the bricks is too low

1307
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:54,358
I'm going to adjust potassium to nitrate

1308
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,719
ratio in the fertilizer that's the very

1309
00:52:54,358 --> 00:53:00,480
first thing either reduce the nitrogen

1310
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:01,578
increase the potassium or do a little of

1311
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,920
both

1312
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:06,780
the like I said if you overdo it with

1313
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,220
nitrates which most Growers do they

1314
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,220
think oh I need the yields give it more

1315
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:13,318
nitrogen well they just did the plant

1316
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:14,699
will it's a luxury element the plant's

1317
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,739
going to take up nitrate nitrogen

1318
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:19,439
whether it needs it or not

1319
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:21,058
but it takes a lot of energy away from

1320
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,639
photosynthesis

1321
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,319
about 30 percent of the energy of the

1322
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,179
plant goes into assimilating the

1323
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,099
nitrates so you give it more and more

1324
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,919
nitrates it'll it'll take a look at the

1325
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:33,359
bricks the the

1326
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,358
stored sugars go down

1327
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:39,779
and also with too much nitrogen get big

1328
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:42,539
cells with thin cell walls it's an easy

1329
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:46,500
meal for insects

1330
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:49,318
it it's a very easy for for fungus to

1331
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,539
get attached so the number one thing to

1332
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:54,779
increase drips bricks is not to over

1333
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:57,300
fertilize especially with nitrogen cut

1334
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:00,420
back to the lower end of the sufficiency

1335
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,359
range of your plants and I do leaf

1336
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,159
analysis too in their my facility and

1337
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,078
check out what what the nitrogen is and

1338
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,480
I've been continually been cutting back

1339
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:12,420
even what I thought was a good number

1340
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,818
I'm realizing the plants don't need that

1341
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,818
much nitrogen and if I can cut it back

1342
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:19,318
the bricks goes up and potassium on the

1343
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:21,539
other end potassium is the health

1344
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:24,179
element it helps in carbohydrate

1345
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:27,179
metabolism to manufacture the sugars

1346
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:29,639
also it helps in loading the sugars into

1347
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:31,799
the sap and also it helps to activate

1348
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,199
enzymes that will convert the stored

1349
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,000
sugars the starches into sugars that can

1350
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:36,899
flow to the flowers and be stored in the

1351
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,358
fruit

1352
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,579
so potassium is a good thing I like to

1353
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,980
raise that but lower my nitrogen until I

1354
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:47,039
find that sweet spot pardon the pun The

1355
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,780
Sweet Spot now you can go beyond you

1356
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,838
want to go beyond that you're going to

1357
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,900
want to improve the uptake of nutrients

1358
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:57,358
so the kelp humic acid you get more

1359
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,160
lateral root growth more root mass you

1360
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,078
have a sponge or Roots but it's going to

1361
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:03,659
take up more water and minerals get more

1362
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:06,000
chemical reactions higher bricks

1363
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:08,279
so we can do it at the roots we can do

1364
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,159
it with the foliar at the at the leaves

1365
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,680
and we can of course

1366
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:16,318
first just make sure we have a balanced

1367
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:19,039
nutrient for the plants

1368
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,719
and the bricks goes up

1369
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:24,480
Trace elements are important for that

1370
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,679
too because it stimulates metabolism at

1371
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,960
the root Zone

1372
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,699
and that stimulus metabolism of

1373
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,119
microorganisms and there's some

1374
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:36,118
microorganisms that literally make

1375
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,760
volatile organic compounds that tell

1376
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,780
that turn off the sugar signal in the

1377
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,380
plant

1378
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,940
so later in the in toward harvest the

1379
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,280
plant doesn't know it has enough stored

1380
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,800
carbohydrates so it continues to do

1381
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,019
photosynthesis continues to make sugars

1382
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,300
all the way to the day of harvest

1383
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:56,759
so if we can stimulate some of the

1384
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,160
microbes like bacillus sunless gb03

1385
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,559
maybe add some molasses toward the end

1386
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:03,779
the Molasses won't go into the plant

1387
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,859
it'll feed the microbes and the microbes

1388
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:10,740
will tell the plant make more sugar

1389
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:13,078
um one last part of that is iron iron is

1390
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:15,419
one of the limiting factors in soil it

1391
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:17,700
gets oxidized turns into rust really

1392
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,240
easily and then it becomes unavailable

1393
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:24,419
but iron is a cofactor in the production

1394
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,818
of chlorophyll the pigment that absorbs

1395
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:30,240
the light and makes the sugars so we get

1396
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:32,460
good iron uptake Trace elements

1397
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,899
then that again is going to contribute

1398
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
to your bricks

1399
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,800
in the end

1400
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,838
iron copper

1401
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,740
manganese

1402
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,380
um

1403
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:48,058
are the big ones one more thing um

1404
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:51,180
remember CO2 right at ambient CO2

1405
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:54,059
rubisco the that's the enzyme in

1406
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,679
photosynthesis that actually assimilates

1407
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:58,740
the carbon dioxide

1408
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:02,039
changes into organic carbon

1409
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:05,098
um that is the limiting factor under

1410
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,539
ambient CO2 if you're growing at high

1411
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,300
CO2

1412
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:11,099
then rubisco is no longer the limiting

1413
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,559
factor because there's extra carbon

1414
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:16,019
dioxide for the plant to take in and in

1415
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,960
that case of the electron transport

1416
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:20,759
chain becomes the limiting factor and

1417
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,460
those that's where those Trace elements

1418
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,280
uh availability are going to really

1419
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,980
Shine for increasing your bricks at the

1420
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,079
end so much good information bricks can

1421
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,880
definitely be beneficial for sure this

1422
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,019
whole episode has just been fantastic I

1423
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,000
think my audience is going to get a lot

1424
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:38,519
of value from it we are coming up

1425
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,079
towards the end here and one thing I

1426
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:42,179
want to give you the opportunity is to

1427
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,039
tell the listeners how can they find you

1428
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:45,838
and do you have anything upcoming in the

1429
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,318
future that you want to talk about yeah

1430
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:51,539
I guess so um not real easy to find me

1431
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,420
these days because I'm I'm not teaching

1432
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:56,940
my classes this year my online when you

1433
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,740
did the master Growers short course but

1434
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,358
I am going to restart that and I'm going

1435
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:01,799
to add new material

1436
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:03,900
because I've been working in the

1437
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,900
commercial facilities for the last few

1438
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:10,260
years so I have some things to add

1439
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:12,539
to that I didn't do in the short course

1440
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:15,059
but right now I guess the easiest way

1441
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,619
would just be to email me send me an

1442
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:17,819
email and say hey when your classes

1443
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:20,220
starting up

1444
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:24,019
I'll try to keep track of that and let

1445
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:28,259
you know and my email is Harley

1446
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:33,659
h-a-r-l-e-y like the motorcycle Dot

1447
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:35,640
p as in Peter H as in Hotel

1448
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:40,440
T is in Tom

1449
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:40,440
Harley dot p h t gmail.com

1450
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:44,219
so

1451
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:46,858
just send me a just drop me an email and

1452
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:48,779
then we can keep in touch uh I don't

1453
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:51,058
really like getting phone calls and

1454
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,099
texts because I work full-time it

1455
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:56,040
interrupts me too much but an email I

1456
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:59,338
check on it every day and um you know as

1457
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:02,338
long as I'm not too exhausted after a 12

1458
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:05,099
hour day I will I'll be happy to respond

1459
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:07,679
or at least let you know what's coming

1460
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:08,880
awesome are you on uh social media at

1461
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:10,679
all like do you have a YouTube channel

1462
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,980
or Instagram or anything like that or no

1463
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:16,798
I don't have my own channel but if you

1464
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,740
uh Google Harley Smith YouTube you'll

1465
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,780
find a lot of free um workshops on there

1466
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:23,879
in lectures

1467
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,920
it's a good place to get started

1468
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,900
I even have some that are just 60 second

1469
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,920
long

1470
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,838
little clippets

1471
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,298
they're pretty popular

1472
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:35,219
on different subjects

1473
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:37,920
so start there

1474
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:41,519
