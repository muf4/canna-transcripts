00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,399
garden I highly recommend seeds here now

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
and you can find them at

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:42,299
www.kencostore.com and fuel on the back

9
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,849
of the container the label says this

10
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,119
product contains sixty seven point five

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,700
nine percent THC this concentrate is

12
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,948
[ __ ] amazing I see why they called it

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,679
holy [ __ ] I'm gonna crack it open right

14
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,030
now we're gonna give it a fresh smell

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,058
the smells coming out of this container

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,579
are amazing there is pineapple there is

17
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:06,298
coconut but then there is also a hint of

18
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,290
gassy skunks this stuff smells crazy and

19
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,470
then looking at it

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,880
it looks like a chunk of nice butter if

21
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:13,798
you've got like a fresh chunk of butter

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,269
sitting on a tray that is kind of what

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,500
this looks like maybe a little piece of

24
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,899
cheesecake just waiting for you to

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,938
nibble on the holy [ __ ]

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,060
live batter from Green Dot labs is

27
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:27,149
tremendous then when you dab it this

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,609
stuff tastes like you just drank a pina

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,439
colada or a horchata or maybe you just

30
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,390
drank some coconut milk with a little

31
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,758
bit of pineapple juice in it this stuff

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,250
tastes ridiculously good then on the

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,140
exhale you get a sweetness with a little

34
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,209
bit of fuel that just lingers for a few

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,460
minutes really impressive concentrate

36
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,169
I'm really glad I picked this one up big

37

email that I mentioned before but let's

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,500
chat for a few minutes before we get

60
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,060
there I've got a couple of things I

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,710
would like to tell you about before we

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,259
get to that email let's talk about

63
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,560
something I got to do just a few days

64
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,659
ago recently I was given a clone of the

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,099
Mac one cut by a very good friend big

66
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,509
thanks I'm not sure if he wants a shout

67
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,370
out on the show I'm sure he doesn't want

68
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,679
everybody else messaging him asking him

69
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,000
for a clone so big private personal

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,569
shout out to my friend who gave me a

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,030
clone of the Mac one that Mac one is one

72
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,909
of the slowest growing plants I have

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,830
ever worked with that plant is being fed

74
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:05,189
great nutrients that plant is in a great

75
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,510
environment but it does not want to grow

76
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:10,509
everybody I talked to says that the Mac

77
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,429
grows ridiculously slowly I think I've

78
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:14,469
got her happy I was able to take a clone

79
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,120
off the Mac so I've got a large veg

80
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,709
plant I've got a clone that is rooted

81
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,469
and happy that's working as my backup

82
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,560
mother plant I have since then dragged

83
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:26,650
my Mac one cut into my flowering room

84
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,709
and it has been pollinated by my arise

85
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,439
male known as King Solomon so I have

86
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,049
officially pollinated the Mac one cut

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,000
with my prized King Solomon male I'm

88
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,010
quite excited I can see that the

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,629
pollination took I can see that there

90
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,750
are a few spots where seeds are actually

91
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,939
developing I don't expect a lot of seeds

92
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,739
but I should get at least a few seeds

93
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,560
for myself to play with out of this

94
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,480
first initial cross many other breeders

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,830
have told me that the Mac is hard to

96
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,479
breed with they have said that it does

97
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,890
not take pollen well they said it does

98
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,369
not produce a lot of seeds and

99
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:03,639
oftentimes the progeny is very unstable

100
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,670
I do not know what to expect from my Mac

101
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,109
to arise cross every time I have smoked

102
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,839
the Mac it has been a memorable

103
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,299
experience the flavor of the Mac is

104
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,370
great the buzz from the Mac is great the

105
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,978
only downside to this plant is the way

106
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,040
that it grows I am hoping that by

107
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:23,649
pollinating it by my a rise mail that I

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,110
will fix that slow growth and give this

109
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,250
plant a little more vigour that King

110
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,340
Solomon plant is

111
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,439
to put hyper vigour into its hybrids so

112
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,299
hopefully out of the few seeds I did

113
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,219
generate I will be able to find a

114
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,829
phenotype in there that is very

115
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,170
representative of the Mac potency very

116
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,479
representative of the Mac flavor but I

117
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,900
can correct the growth problems by using

118
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,240
that robust really vigorous arise mail

119
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:51,429
and hopefully put that tray into the

120
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,949
progeny find a phenotype that is a

121
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,870
perfect 50/50 balance and then we can

122
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,180
see what I want to do with that from

123
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,649
there so far this is just a personal

124
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,720
project I just wanted to play with the

125
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,329
Mac somebody was kind enough to gift me

126
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,040
a clone of it as an own breeder I think

127
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:08,740
the next step is for me to pollinate

128
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,110
this plant and see what we create so

129
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,750
stay tuned I will keep you posted we are

130
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,330
at least 40 to 50 days away from these

131
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,120
seeds being harvested so I will have no

132
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:22,120
feedback for you for at least 40 to 50

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,009
days then I will harvest the plant then

134
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,050
once the plant is dry I will crumble up

135
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,240
the buds into a dust then it will pull

136
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,370
the seeds out and count them that will

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
be your next update how many seeds did I

138
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,889
get after that when I do have time and

139
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,659
space I will grow those seeds and I

140
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,479
guarantee you that when I grow out those

141
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,479
Mac one to arise seeds you will see

142
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,390
ridiculous amounts of photos and a lot

143
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,639
of updates here on the podcast so please

144
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,279
stick around please stay tuned and I

145
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,039
will keep you updated as that project

146
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,319
progresses another fun thing I've been

147
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,020
working on is watching my friends

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,599
receive their new testers of something I

149
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,849
am calling the red pill or the blue pill

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,250
that's right I've made some testers they

151
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,200
are feminized seeds I don't have the

152
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,449
space to test them in my personal garden

153
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,759
so I have recruited some very reliable

154
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,159
friends to test grow these seeds for me

155
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,719
several of the packages have landed at

156
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,090
my friends locations and they have

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,820
germinated these seeds and I am excited

158
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:24,609
to watch the testing of the red pill and

159
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,439
the blue pill unfold there was also a

160
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,290
third option that some people received

161
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,449
it is not a feminized cross it is a rare

162
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,850
indica dominant cross most of the things

163
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,889
I make are very sativa dominant this one

164
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,500
is going to be heavy on the indica side

165
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,300
so I'm quite excited to see what comes

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,810
from these tester seeds I've sent out

167
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,400
the red

168
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,439
Hill I've sent out the blue pill and

169
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,839
I've sent out the indica dominant cross

170
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,000
they have landed have been germinated

171
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,179
and before too long we will start seeing

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,220
progress photos one thing that I find

173
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,470
really entertaining is I just randomly

174
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,240
labeled these seeds as the red pill or

175
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,310
the blue pill and offered them to my

176
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,829
friends as testers and I said would you

177
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,839
like the red pill or the blue pill it is

178
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:06,459
just an arbitrary name it has nothing to

179
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,229
do with the plants themselves with the

180
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,449
seeds of themselves I just wanted to

181
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,950
pick a label that was fun the red pill

182
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,680
or the blue pill sounded like a fun

183
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:16,779
offering for my friends the best part of

184
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,300
the whole situation was that everybody

185
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,168
who was given the option selected the

186
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,199
red pill

187
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:24,399
nobody selected the blue pill when given

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,740
the option I don't know what kind of

189
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,269
weird psychological game that was but I

190
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,900
thought it was very interesting that

191
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:33,609
everybody selected the red pill so once

192
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:35,379
again stay tuned I've got a bunch of

193
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,210
great tester seeds out we should start

194
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,889
seeing photos I will start giving you

195
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,689
more reports and more updates on those

196
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,889
testers I will let you know if they will

197
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,110
be released to the public

198
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,000
and once testing is complete before I

199
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,270
release them I will announce the

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,069

you feel like you are qualified to test

217
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,470
row seeds for me before I release them

218
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:31,839
to the public

219
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,149
I need people who can take good notes I

220
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,889
need people who can communicate well I

221
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,699
need people who can take quality

222
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,439
photographs

223
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,900
I need people who are not going to get

224
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,300
these seeds and disappear on me if you

225
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,639
think you can be a reliable tester for I

226
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,579
read genetic seeds send me an email

227
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,439
it's I read genetics at hotmail.com you

228
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,720
have to put the word tester and the

229
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,990
subject line and then in the body of

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,750
that email and pray

231
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,470
me let me know why you are qualified to

232
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,778
test my unreleased seeds pictures will

233
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,240
go a long way I always talk about

234
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:07,909
looking at my friends photos and when it

235
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,289
comes time to select testers sometimes I

236
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,059
randomly go to my friends who have

237
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:13,129
posted good photos and I say hey bro

238
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:15,559
would you like to test some stuff for me

239
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:19,399
and 90% of the time they say yes I would

240
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,169
so good photos go a long way if you can

241
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,120
take good notes if you can stay in touch

242
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:25,309
with me throughout the entire grow and

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,830
if you can take quality photos you may

244
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:30,169
qualify to be an IRA genetics tester

245
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,330
once again the email address is I read

246
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,099
genetics at hotmail.com make sure you

247
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,950
put the word tester and the subject line

248
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,019
and make sure you impress me in your

249
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,910
email all right I've got one more thing

250
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,370
to ramble about before we get into this

251
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,500
email let's talk about something I've

252
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,629
been focused on for most of the week I

253
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,519
am a little bit limited on how much I'm

254
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:53,080
allowed to share on this project but I

255
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:57,379
have spent most of my week working on a

256
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,180
revised floor plan and an application to

257
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:02,000
open one of the first medical marijuana

258
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:04,309
cultivation facilities in another state

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,559
that are just about ready to roll out

260
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,449
their medical marijuana program I can't

261
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,159
give you too many details but I can tell

262
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,350
you that I have been working day and

263
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,208
night for the past week getting an

264
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,170
application filled out making sure that

265
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,328
all the questions are answered

266
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,679
sufficiently I've been working with a

267
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:21,379
large team to make sure that this

268
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,269
project goes smoothly and today we

269
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:25,039
officially finished our application

270
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,919
process and the application has been

271
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,389
turned in I feel like we completed all

272
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,639
of the questions to the best of our

273
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,389
ability and we stand a very good chance

274
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,338
of being granted our requested license

275
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,860
for a large medical marijuana

276
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,300
cultivation facility now I'm sure by now

277
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,009
a lot of people are going oh [ __ ] as

278
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:45,620
Rasta Jeff gonna move no don't worry I

279
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,299
am NOT relocating this new project may

280
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,570
require a little bit more travel but I

281
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:52,699
can do 75 to 85% of the work that is

282
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,350
required online most of it is done

283
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,390
through video chat and conference calls

284
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,820
and Google Docs so that makes things

285
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,769
very easy but I am working very closely

286
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,480
with this group we have designed a very

287
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,789
nice facility we have created a very

288
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,310
nice workflow and I feel like we stand a

289
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,319
very good chance of having our app

290
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,689
location approved so in the very near

291
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,580
future I should be able to announce that

292
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,460
in another state there will be an IRA

293
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,100
genetics run large-scale medical

294
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,810
marijuana cultivation facility now we

295
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,670
can't celebrate yet we still have to

296
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:25,609
have the license approved but I feel

297
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:28,099
like we stand a very good chance and

298
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,919
even if we don't get approved I learned

299
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,100
a lot in this application process this

300
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:36,169
new state had a lot of very detailed

301
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,149
questions I haven't seen an application

302
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:40,939
like this yet they broke it down into

303
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,470
several categories I really like the way

304
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,779
that this place is rolling out there

305
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,850
Medical Marijuana rules they work very

306
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:49,159
well with cultivators they work very

307
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,409
well with dispensary owners or potential

308
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,778
dispensary owners and I feel like they

309
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:55,429
want to understand the industry more

310
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:57,679
than they want to limit the industry

311
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,179
another state I work with I feel like

312
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,709
they just keep setting up hurdles that

313
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,179
like you want medical marijuana we'd

314
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,250
love to give it to you but first do a

315
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,409
backflip over this and then roll through

316
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,669
this fire and then you got a [ __ ] tug

317
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,110
on this rope and then you got to go

318
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:10,969
through an American Ninja Warrior course

319
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,289
and this other state it feels like

320
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,450
they're saying oh you want medical

321
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:17,059
marijuana what can we do to make this

322
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,620
happen for you so this new state is very

323
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,049
welcoming it feels like it is going to

324
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,060
be a very great rollout and if the group

325
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:25,669
that I'm involved with get our license

326
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,829
approved or not I am still very proud to

327
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:29,719
have been a part of the project that I

328
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,180
am participating in and I am still very

329
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,430
excited to see how this state rolls out

330
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:36,259
their medical marijuana program now with

331
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:39,529
all of that being said let's talk about

332
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:41,870
how tedious these licenses are there

333
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,600
were hundreds of questions it took a

334
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,820
team of us weeks to answer all of these

335
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,259
questions we would answer the questions

336
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,810
we would submit the questions to the

337
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,338
team the lawyers and everybody else the

338
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,569
architects and whoever else wanted to

339
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,040
get involved would all read the

340
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,900
questions and nitpick it and pick it

341
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,939
apart and then you get an email and it

342
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,399
says hey your answer was close we need a

343
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,780
few more details we'd rework it and then

344
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,449
send it back and the process would

345
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,759
happen all over again it took a very

346
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,620
long time to get everything worded to

347
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,110
where it was acceptable for the lawyers

348
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,959
for the doctors side for the cultivators

349
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,879
side for the state side we had to word

350
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,529
everything tore it all made sense to

351
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,629
where everybody could understand it and

352
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,549
it was still completely accurate

353
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:26,448
that takes a lot of time and a lot of

354
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:29,448
review we designed an entire plan from

355
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:31,039
planting a seed to a patient consuming

356
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:33,528
our product we have got every detail

357
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,990
written down I think we've got a great

358
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:38,990
chance now after spending a couple of

359
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,350
weeks on a project like this I want to

360
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,379
talk about how much businesses need your

361
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,990
support any business that is open and

362
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:49,578
running I don't care if it is Starbucks

363
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,159
I don't care if it's a dispensary I

364
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:54,439
don't care if it is the most giant mall

365
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,259
filled with stores I don't care what

366
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,190
type of business it is every business

367
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:03,470

put a lot of time we put a lot of energy

369
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,778
and we put a lot of effort into

370
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:10,818
establishing a solid business so that we

371

energy in I get to see people who have a

399

discomfort or an ailment they show up

400
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,778
and they're like I don't feel well they

401
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,219
leave with the product and they come

402
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:24,769
back several days later and they say

403
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,540
Rasta Jeff that whatever product it was

404
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,879
that you gave me made my whatever

405
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:30,980
problem that I had go away for a few

406
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,838
hours and I was able to hang out with my

407
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,159
family I was able to enjoy a few minutes

408
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,569
with my children and not

409
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,219
feel like a grumpy [ __ ] because

410
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,708
whatever hurts was hurting or whatever

411
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,690
bothers me was bothering me so I get to

412
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,159
offer a great service I get to produce a

413
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,839
product that makes people feel better

414
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,818
and then in the retail end of my

415
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,129
business I get to get that product out

416
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:50,740
to those people and in turn yes we do

417
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:53,778
make a few dollars and we pay the rent

418
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,419
but without the support of our community

419
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:58,879
and the support of our I hate the word

420
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:01,278
customers our patients our clientele we

421
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,350
don't have a business my passion just

422
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,120
becomes a hobby without the support of

423
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,709
our community and our friends and our

424
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,568
family and I hate using the word

425
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,729
customers but without them those

426
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:13,219
businesses the dispensary will be forced

427
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,019
to close once that dispensary closes

428
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,149
there's no need for the cultivation so

429
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:18,919
the cultivation will close and this goes

430
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,899
for any business if you don't go to

431
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,698
whatever your favorite coffee spot is or

432
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,649
your favorite sandwich spot spend a few

433
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:26,389
bucks every occasionally when you do

434
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,938
think about going to that sandwich shop

435
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,769
it will probably be gone it is a very

436
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:32,750
competitive economy it's a very

437
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,549
competitive market right now so any

438
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,799
business has to do everything that they

439
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:38,149
can to survive so I guess what I'm

440
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,969
saying with all of this rambling is

441
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:43,039
please support your local businesses

442
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,689

443
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,299

444
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:49,519

450
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:03,049
dispensaries which I work with of course

451
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,120
I want you to support the places where

452
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:07,698
my cultivated product ends up in the

453
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,038
places I do consultations for but your

454
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,230
local dispensary needs your support your

455
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,879

456
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,120
let's get out there and support our

457
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,220
local businesses and let's kind of stop

458
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,229
some of the infighting and the bickering

459
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,288
about dispensaries and the cannabis

460
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,959
industry we're trying our best there are

461
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:28,849
a lot of rules and regulations and hoops

462
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,640
to jump through that make things a

463
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:34,490
little bit difficult sometimes we want

464
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,820
to make medicine available to patients

465
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,640
we want the most potent the highest

466
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:42,859
quality the cleanest safest most

467
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,320
effective medicine that a patient can

468
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:46,908
get at the best price that is our goal

469
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,059
don't think that we're out there just

470
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:50,340
trying to get rich

471
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:53,250
we want to get medicine to patients a

472
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:56,669
lot of what causes hiccups or problems

473
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,640
are regulations a lot of those we cannot

474
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,920
avoid we want to give you a service so a

475
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,560
lot of people have some hatred and some

476
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,630
kind of grief against dispensaries and

477
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,549
against commercial grows please

478
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,980
understand we are out here doing our

479
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,450
best we don't make up a lot of the rules

480
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,759
we don't make up a lot of the

481
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,559
regulations if it were up to us we would

482
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,329
grow the cannabis we would just open the

483
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,279
back door you guys would come in and pay

484
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:22,129
2 or 3 bucks a gram and smoke out while

485
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,299
you're rolling it up it would be a party

486
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,980
unfortunately there are rules and

487
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,440
regulations that come with legalization

488
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,620
and we have got to follow them if we

489
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,210
want to continue to operate so keep in

490
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,099
mind that the dispensaries and the

491
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,230
cultivations are businesses and if we

492
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,629
don't operate them as a business they

493
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,360
won't be there the next time you go to

494
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,040
shop and honestly if ever that easy to

495
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,409
set up a cultivation facility and

496
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,659
produce a quality clean safe product on

497
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,580
a reliable schedule wouldn't everybody

498
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,440
else already be doing it the

499
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:55,439
professionals are out there trying our

500
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,960
best please bear with us let's end the

501
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,450
public versus the dispensary the black

502
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,069
market versus the legal market let's try

503
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,680
to end all of that and let's just be

504
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,419
Team cannabis all right that's enough

505
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,240
public service announcements for this

506
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,670
episode let's get into the email portion

507
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,200
of this podcast if you have any

508
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,640
cultivation or cannabis culture

509
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,039
questions I would love to hear from you

510
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,890
my email address is grow from your heart

511
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,839
at hotmail.com this first email in this

512
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,000
episode comes from a person who did not

513
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,679
include their name so let's jump right

514
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,789
into it it says what's up just a quick

515
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:32,759
question I am in day 37 of 1212 today

516
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:35,009
sore 37 days into flower he goes on to

517
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:39,000
say I have two lights on a digital timer

518
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:41,099
and one on a tab timer well a storm hit

519
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,470
4 days ago and the electric went out for

520
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,240
about an hour right after the lights

521
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,680
came on for the day I can kind of

522
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,930
already see where this email is headed

523
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,120
he says the digital timer was fine

524
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,690
because it holds the time if it cuts off

525
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,000
Aurum plugs but the tab timer stopped

526
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,529
for about an hour while the power was

527
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,670
out so let me talk about what happened

528
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,129
there because some people may not have

529
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,798
caught on to that

530
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,789
this person has two different timers in

531
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:06,500
their grow room

532
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,230
they've got lights plugged into both

533
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,569
timers they have both timers set for 12

534
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,169
12 - we're both timers come on at a

535
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:17,359
given time both go off at a given time

536
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:20,570
however the power went out in this

537
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,369
person's house so the digital timer kept

538
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,470
on ticking with the correct time it's

539
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,808
got a battery backup it is digital it

540
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:30,500
keeps on moving nothing went wrong there

541
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:32,779
on the other light there is a timer with

542
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,519
little push tabs that you push down for

543
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,960
the light to be on and you pop them up

544
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,819
for the light to be off it could be the

545
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,679
opposite but it doesn't matter right now

546
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,019
you push tabs and the lights either off

547
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,429
or on when it's on that section and then

548
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:46,970
when it goes to the other section it

549
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,100
does the opposite that timer has a dial

550
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,980
on it that spins like a real clock and

551
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:55,969
that is what triggers the switch to go

552
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,190
on or off now when the power stops that

553
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,319
timer stops as well it does not spin

554
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,830
anymore it does not have a battery back

555
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,418
up

556
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:07,428
so if the power went out at one o'clock

557
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:09,559
that grow room that timer thought that

558
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,860
it was one o'clock until the power came

559
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:15,889
back on so time Stood Still for that one

560
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:17,658
timer the digital timer resumed its

561
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,580
normal schedule when the power came on

562
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,950
the lights came on just like it should

563
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:23,928
everything functioned now when the

564
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,240
lights were to scheduled were scheduled

565
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,759
to go off is when we had our problem

566
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,579
since that one timer was off for a

567
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:34,038
duration of time it is now behind by

568
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,829
that exact duration so when the digital

569
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,250
timer clicked off our spinny dial timer

570
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:42,230
continued to light the room so now let's

571
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,769
catch up with a question here is some

572
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,659
more he says the digital timer was fine

573
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,970
because it holds the time if it cuts off

574
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:52,549
but the tab timers stopped for one hour

575
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,220
so we had one extra hour of light time

576
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,558
at the end of that flowering day the

577
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,140
email keeps going it says so my question

578
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:03,139
is since my girls are used to total

579
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,909
darkness starting at 6 p.m. is it going

580
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,520
to hurt anything now that they have been

581
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,679
getting one extra hour of light for 4

582
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,319
days thanks and Cheers

583
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,930
PS your podcast has helped me and mine

584
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,490
more than once so thank you for that

585
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,750
hey you were very welcome I'm glad that

586
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,059
I've helped you out a couple of times in

587
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,809
the past I hope that I can help you out

588
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:26,990
again this time so for 4 days you had an

589
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,980
extra 1 hour of light in your flower

590
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,079
room you are 37 days in to flower now

591
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,750
we've got a couple of things to think

592
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,689
about we are nearly 40 days into the

593
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,630
flowering cycle I am hoping that this

594
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,799
light interruption did not cause any

595
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:47,210
hermaphrodite issues in your Gro

596
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,759
interruptions of the dark cycle are the

597
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,759
number one trigger for hermaphrodites in

598
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,920
your plants now if your plants herb will

599
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:57,109
be up to a couple of things first thing

600
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,180
is genetics how stable are those

601
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:01,549
genetics have you ever seen those plants

602
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,130
erm before have they ever heard out due

603
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:06,559
to any other type of stress if so you

604
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,380
may see some hermaphrodites in this crop

605
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,869
now the plants may be too far into

606
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,130
flower to her Manyu they may just be so

607
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:14,750
far into flower that they're like

608
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,040
whatever we don't even care that you

609
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,950
interrupted us for a couple of days

610
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,649
we're going to be just fine that is up

611
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,630
to the genetics of the plant now being

612
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,240
that late into the flowering phase if

613
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,950
they do decide to her you've got a

614
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,990
couple of options you may see some

615
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,450
bananas pop up you can remove those

616
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,549
bananas if you'd like but you are so

617
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,670
close to harvest that you won't have

618
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:39,829
time to produce mature seeds it

619
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,620
generally takes four to six weeks to

620
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:45,169
develop a seed your plants are probably

621
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:47,509
going to come down much sooner than that

622
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:50,300
you may have some small white seeds in

623
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:52,279
your crop but again that just depends on

624
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,750
the genetics of each plant I don't know

625
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,339
what plants you've got in your room I

626
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,720
don't know what other stressors you've

627
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,250
got going on I don't know what they've

628
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,779
been fed I don't know if you've got

629
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,940
other environmental factors that may

630
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,129
contribute to stress that may lead to

631
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,950
these plants showing hermaphroditic

632
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,890
traits so at this point you've got about

633
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,680
23 to 30 days left on your flowering

634
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,200
phase I would get them back on 1212 as

635
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,150
soon as possible I would also get rid of

636
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,190
that tab timer and replace it with

637
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,080
another digital timer I'm sure you've

638
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,910
learned your lesson and I'm sure that a

639
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,129
lot of other people listening have just

640
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,470
learned a very valuable lesson through

641
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,850
that so get rid of that type tab timer

642
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,649
and get yourself another

643
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:33,048
digital timer so you don't have this

644
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:35,239
problem again once you've got the time

645
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:37,819
corrected you have to pay close

646
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,649
attention to the plants you may see

647
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:42,200
bananas you may see a little

648
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:45,109
hermaphrodite flowers pop up if you see

649
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,149
those you need to consider your next

650
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,979
step do you want to pluck those do you

651
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:51,319
want to cut off that branch it just

652
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,960
depends on how many nanners or male

653
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:56,089
flowers you see developing if it's just

654
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,380
one or two I may spray it with a little

655
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:59,808
water and then pluck it with tweezers

656
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,450
depending on how far along in the flower

657
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:04,730
I honestly may just leave it quite often

658
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,730
form aphrodite flowers that pop up that

659
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,460
lay in flower are sterile they do not

660
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,829
contain any pollen I understand that you

661
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,440
may not want to run the risk of a male

662
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:17,509
plant that may or may not contain pollen

663
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,610
so you may want to spray those remove

664
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:22,099
them with tweezers if there are a lot in

665
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,319
one bud cut out the bud if there's a lot

666
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,599
in one branch cut out the branch if

667
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,519
there are a lot on one plant it is time

668
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,339
to consider removing that plant from the

669
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,019
grow if your plants are showing

670
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:35,720
hermaphroditic traits from this light

671
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,269
interruption I would consider different

672
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,710
cultivars for my next grow you know that

673
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,808
these plants have the potential for

674
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,970
hermaphroditism I wouldn't grow those

675
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,829
again I would get rid of them and find

676
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,769
something that does not show intersex

677
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:51,408
traits so the first plan of attack is to

678
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:53,000
get these lights back on 1212 your next

679
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:54,889
step is to get rid of that piece of [ __ ]

680
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,470
timer and get something more reliable

681
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:59,479
then you have to pay close attention to

682
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,028
these plants throughout the rest of the

683
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,589
flowering phase I'm going to hope that

684
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:06,558
you don't see any hermaphrodite flowers

685
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:09,019
pop up if you do you have got to

686
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,418
re-strategize at that point and consider

687
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,069
your options do you cut the flowers out

688
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,990
do you cut the buds out do you cut the

689
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:17,839
branch out do you cut the plant out or

690
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,359
do you ignore it and let it grow like

691
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,069
business as usual hopefully you learned

692
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,569
something from this hopefully you've

693
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,220
already replaced that timer and

694
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:27,048
hopefully everybody listening that has

695
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,360
one of those piece of [ __ ] tab timers is

696
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:32,058
jumping on Amazon and replacing it with

697
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,528
something digital right now you did not

698
