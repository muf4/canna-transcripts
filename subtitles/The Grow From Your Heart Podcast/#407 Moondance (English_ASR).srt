this Rasta Jeff I'm a new grower and

77
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,818
your podcast is one of the best I've

78
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,799
heard it is full of specific practical

79
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:13,048
and reasonable suggestions for

80
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,209
successfully growing the plant keep up

81
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,939
the good work your latest compilations

82
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,310
of grow lessons are golden hey that is a

83
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,079
great way to start an email I love

84
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,909
hearing that I'm helping people I love

85
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,469
that you love the compilations and I

86
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,150
love that you think I am the best I'm

87
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,979
honestly not in competition with anybody

88
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,870
but when you're told the best it

89
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,909
honestly makes all of the work and all

90
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,129
the effort worth it so thank you for

91
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,469
starting out with a huge compliment the

92
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:41,068
email continues he says I have got one

93
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:43,560
question / comment he says what is the

94
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:45,869
basis for the really hard insistence on

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,389
having absolutely no light during dark

96
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,730
periods and flowering then he quotes me

97
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,859
by saying if you can see your hand in

98
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:54,689
front of your face after five minutes in

99
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,639
your grow tent when it's dark then

100
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,439
that's too much light and he's

101
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,969
absolutely right I do remember saying

102
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,159
that and I still stand behind that

103
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,378
statement and I will explain why in just

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,810
a second the message continues he says

105
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,578
from an outdoor grow perspective this

106
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,370
would never be the case because of the

107
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,620
simple fact of moonlight all outdoor

108
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,319
plants deal with significant moonlight

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,149
for two or three weeks every month and a

110
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,180
cannabis plant is likely to have at

111
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,908
least two cycles of this during early

112
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,098
and late fall right outdoor grows don't

113
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,060
seem to suffer from this light so what's

114
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,459
the issue is

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,740
is a natural strike against was possible

116
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,930
in an outdoor grow I'm just curious

117
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,090
about this and I'm very interested in

118
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,639
what you think thanks again for the

119
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:41,399
great and generous podcast I'm learning

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,439
a lot and I trust what you're teaching

121
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,359
hey thanks for the trust that means a

122
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,668
lot to me now this is a great question

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,840
and I have a really great answer you can

124
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,459
tell that my voice is kind of burning

125
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,929
out so I'm going to press pause and I'm

126
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,849
going to get my voice fresh and I'm

127
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,129
going to come back and give you a solid

128
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,360
answer on this question you take a DAB

129
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,339
while I take a drink

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,740
all right podcast world I am well

131
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,869
hydrated and my voice feels fresh let's

132
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,360
talk about why our outdoor cannabis

133
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,478
plants don't have light interruption

134
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,629
problems from the moon there are several

135
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,719
things that contribute to this question

136
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,519
the main thing is the Sun when we are

137
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,950
growing outdoors we are growing under

138
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,609
the most powerful most efficient grow

139
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,560
light known to man that is the Sun this

140
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,100
comes into play for a lot of reasons

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,250
first off as the Sun sets the Sun puts

142
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,580
off a spectrum that is known as a far

143
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,379
red light spectrum now this far red

144
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,409
light spectrum is picked up by our

145
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:43,889
plants by something called phytochrome

146
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,530
red phytochrome red is a protein it

147
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,779
works as kind of a it has several

148
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,109
functions first of all it is a receptor

149
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,449
the phytochrome red can see that far red

150
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,370
light it knows that it is what receives

151
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,310
far red light it goes hey it is my turn

152
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,829
to fire up I'm a phytochrome red little

153
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,180
protein and I see that far red light

154
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:07,349
it's my turn to do my job

155
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,478
that phytochrome red protein tells the

156
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,910
plant that it is sleepy time and it

157
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,490
makes the plant effectively go to sleep

158
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,000
it turns the plant off for the day now

159
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,150
that plant is much less susceptible to

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,550
light interruptions because the Sun put

161
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:26,149
out a far red spectrum that was received

162
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,250
by a protein inside of the plant called

163
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:31,589
phytochrome red the function of that

164
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,350
phytochrome red is to start triggering

165
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,598
one of the functions of phytochrome red

166
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,240
is to start triggering that plant to go

167
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,539
to sleep so it is basically I guess a

168
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,560
good way to describe it

169
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,900
it is like when you get one of those

170
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,410
hypnotist so when you say when I snap my

171
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:50,589
fingers you will fall asleep sleep and

172
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,270
phytochrome read far-red sleepy time

173
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:54,009
it's hypnotized it went to sleep and

174
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,149
then you need the opposite to wake it up

175
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,649
in the morning but we're gonna talk

176
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,049
about that spectrum in another episode

177
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,609
we're trying to focus here on why we

178
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,220
don't have light interruptions under the

179
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,310
moon so the main contributing factor is

180
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,410
the Sun the Sun is the brightest grow

181
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,030
light we could imagine so we have the

182
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,000
Sun the brightest light you can imagine

183
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,069
all day long the Sun goes down it puts

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,839
out the far read that far red is our

185
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,550
second contributing factor the far red

186
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,379
tells the phytochrome red which is

187
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,819
factor number three that it's time to

188
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,819
tuck those plants in so now they are

189
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,310
sleeping know those three things that

190
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,189
bright bright ass light all day that

191
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,810
phytochrome red and that far red are

192
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,459
going to put the plants in such a deep

193
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,040
sleep that you're going to need a

194
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:38,859
significant light interruption to cause

195
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,330
any noticeable problems now I've got to

196
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,939
wrap that rant up with one of my

197
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:45,879
favorite things to say of course this is

198
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:49,149
very strain specific this could be very

199
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,250
phenotype specific the moon is not going

200
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,799
to disrupt your plants however a

201
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,680
flashlight or some car headlights may

202
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,240
disrupt some of your plants that is

203
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,379
where it becomes plant and

204
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,600
strain-specific

205
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,029
these plants are under such a powerful

206
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,430
light all day long I mean the Sun that

207
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:08,259
your flashlights at night probably and

208
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm saying probably will be very

209
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,099
insignificant if you hear something out

210
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,629
in the garden and you just shine the

211
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,939
flashlight real quick who's out there

212
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:18,370
you're probably not going to disrupt the

213
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:20,500
flowering period our plants are more

214
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,899
sensitive to photo period disruption

215
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,639
early and flower so once you get peak

216
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,620
flowering time you don't have as much to

217
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,959
worry about early and flower is where

218
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,850
they will be more sensitive but with

219
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,069
this super combination of that powerful

220
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,080
light all day that far red spectrum

221
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,450
telling the plants hey you need to go to

222
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,800
sleep and that phytochrome protein

223
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,540
within the plant saying hey you're right

224
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,949
we do need to go to sleep all of those

225
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,889
things working together should touch

226
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,430
your plants in quite nicely now don't

227
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,860
get me wrong

228
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,289
enough intense light at a long enough

229
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,990
duration does have the potential to

230
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:54,289
disrupt your outdoor flowering plants

231
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,659
but it is probable

232
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:59,449
we going to take a much more powerful

233
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:02,000
and a much longer duration of light

234
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,000
interruption to cause any problems than

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,830
it would in an indoor environment in an

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,929
indoor environment you don't have the

237
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,270
Sun in an indoor environment you are

238
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:13,669
probably not getting far red lighting

239
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,799
some companies have started making red

240
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,959
lighting available to the home grower

241
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,179
but it is uncommon so most folks don't

242
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,980
have that at this time so you're not

243
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:23,870
getting that Sun you're not getting that

244
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,480
far red which means you are not getting

245
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,370
that phytochrome red protein which is

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,980
telling your plants to go to sleep so

247
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,139
your plants are kind of napping indoors

248
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,029
and it takes them a little bit longer to

249
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,819
actually get to sleep let's talk about

250
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,620
that for a little bit

251
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,320
several times I have been asked why do

252
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,230
my plants go into flower outdoors before

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,420
we have reached an actual 1212 cycle

254
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,980
someone will say where I'm getting 14

255
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,289
hours of daylight and my plants have

256
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,080
started to flower what's wrong there are

257
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:56,230
two major contributing factors that

258
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,180
decide when your plant flowers outside

259
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,340
the first one is what is known as the

260
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:03,469
critical period every plant has a

261
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,420
critical period that means how many

262
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,370
hours of continued darkness does this

263
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,740
plant need before it starts flowering

264
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,929
now based on where your plant is from

265
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,970
geographically it will possibly have a

266
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:16,789
different critical photo period

267
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,639
flowering time some places like Alaska

268
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:21,589
don't get much darkness ever so the

269
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,889
plants from Alaska have adapted to

270
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:27,110
flower with less dark time places like

271
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,539
here in Colorado we get a really nice

272
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,940
night cycle so the plants that are from

273
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,379
here have adapted to expect more of a

274
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,330
night cycle you'll need to give them

275
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,269
more uninterrupted hours of darkness

276
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,310
before they will initiate flowering most

277
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,559
of what modern breeders have bred will

278
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:43,909
flower under a 12:12 condition that's

279
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,219
what we have found works best for

280
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,169
indoors if it doesn't work that way we

281
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,970
have probably eliminated it by now and

282
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:52,490
it's been removed from the gene pool of

283
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,230
course there are auto flower plants they

284
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,909
will flower under whatever light

285
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,129
conditions you put them under because

286
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:59,839
those are bred from those plants that

287
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:02,539
came from the environments that did not

288
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,790
get any darkness so one of the main

289
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:07,730
contributing factors is what is known as

290
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,088
the critical period now the other thing

291
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,709
that is

292
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,540
contributing to our outdoor plants

293
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,808
flowering with more than 12 hours of

294
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:17,929
daylight time is that far red spectrum

295
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:19,969
again as the Sun starts to set it puts

296
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,159
off that far red spectrum the Sun is

297
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,870
still up we can still see there's still

298
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,389
enough light illuminating the sky to

299
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,490
where we can function but that far red

300
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,620
spectrum is telling the plants hey I'm

301
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,568
starting to activate my phytochrome red

302
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,549
protein and it feels like I want to take

303
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,588
a nap so they start putting on their

304
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:37,849
night clothes they start doing whatever

305
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,740
they're drinking they're sleepy time tea

306
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,629
they're smoking that nighttime joint and

307
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,120
they are getting themselves ready to go

308
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,339
to bed even if there is still a little

309
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,709
bit of light out so that is my long

310
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,230
rambling explanation of why the moon

311
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,568
does not cause light interruptions in

312
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,879
our outdoor cannabis garden and I also

313
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:58,278
touched briefly on why our outdoor

314
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,980
plants are beginning to flower when

315
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,198
there is still more than 12 hours of

316
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,759
visible daylight all right I want to

317
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:06,708
thank you once again for a great email

318
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm not sure if you want me to see your

319
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,748
name on the show but you know who you

320
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,579
are

321
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:12,920
thanks for a great message thanks for

322
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:15,198
great content and I look forward to your

323
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,909
next question if anybody else out there

324
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:19,729
has a grow question I would love to hear

325
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:23,028
from you my email address is grow from

326
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,709
your heart at hotmail.com I've got

327
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:28,428
another email in front of me and it goes

328
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:30,078
just like this Rasta Jeff in advance I

329
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:32,389
would like to thank you for any advice

330
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,578
that you have to give I have recently

331
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:37,278
installed a mini-split system in my

332
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:39,498
small grow the mini split is overkill

333
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,328
but for my circumstance it's more

334
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:43,459
stealth than a window unit yeah I

335
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:45,258
understand that completely he also says

336
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,928
I covered the green light display

337
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:51,409
sufficiently so I thought and I ran my

338
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:52,759
new seeds my Bodhi seeds did great he

339
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,318
got some seeds from Bodhi who was a

340
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,110
great reader big shout-out to our friend

341
00:12:54,318 --> 00:13:00,078
Bodhi he said those seeds did great no

342
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,839
hermaphrodites the freebies that came

343
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,958
with the Ken Kesey were labeled Diesel

344
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,240
Pakistani one of the diesel Pakistani

345
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:10,008
herm Don me and you guys when we say it

346
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,289
herm Don him that means at some point in

347
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:15,230
the flowering phase that female plant

348
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,149
decided to display male parts which

349
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,100
means that that male flower can produce

350
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,990
pollen which can pollinate your female

351
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,649
crop which will put seeds in the whole

352
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,810
female

353
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,759
which lessens the quality lessens the

354
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,649
potency lessens the desirability and

355
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,379
kind of ruins the whole project unless

356
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,649
you wanted seeds so one of the diesel

357
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,570
Pakistani has become a hermaphrodite

358
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,610
this message continues to say I have

359
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,950
always just sat for a few minutes in my

360
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,470
darkroom to notice the most obvious of

361
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,180
light leaks I take your advice and I

362
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,278
hang out in the room for twenty to

363
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,679
thirty minutes to ensure there are no

364
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,570
obvious light leaks is it the green

365
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,088
light display leaking through the top of

366
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,278
the mini-split do you think that that

367
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,200
super dim green light could have caused

368
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,210
the hermaphrodite should the whole room

369
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,490
have hermaphrodite it or would it be

370
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,370
more likely to be an unstable diesel

371
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,169
strain I've got one more diesel

372
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,330
Pakistani to double check in the back

373
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,759
corner and I just can't really get a

374
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,070
good look at the lower limbs so I am

375
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,710
unsure if all of the diesel Pakistani

376
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,300
have become hermaphrodites he wraps up

377
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,830
the message by saying thanks again for

378
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,169
the advice and then he signs his name

379
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,629
now I've got a couple things to say

380
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,490
about this message first of all that

381
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,669
plant that is in the back that you are

382
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,169
unable to check check that check it soon

383
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,509
that plant

384
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:35,240
quite possibly has hermaphroditic

385
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,879
tendencies it came from a pack that is

386
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,730
proven to have hermaphrodite traits so

387
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,309
it is possible it is very likely also

388
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,830
the parts that you can't see are where

389
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:47,329
you are very likely to get her flowers

390
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,009
that section that's not getting enough

391
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,170
light that part down there on the bottom

392
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,909
that's where you're gonna get a bunch of

393
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:55,490
boy flowers so I recommend you get in

394
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:57,559
there and check immediately now let's

395
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,169
address the actual question the main

396
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,989
question was do I think the green light

397
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:06,559
leaking from your mini-split caused this

398
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,930
hermaphrodite issue no I do not think

399
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,789
the green light was the overall cause of

400
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,979
your hermaphrodite I think the

401
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,838
hermaphrodite is most likely a genetics

402
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,519
issue you said the bodhi seeds did not

403
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,830
have any problems but that diesel

404
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,120
Pakistani is the one that earned I would

405
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,550
assume that that's where the problem

406
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,409
lies is within that diesel Pakistani it

407
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,990
was also a freebie so that may be a

408
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:28,669
small indicator of problems just because

409
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,139
it was the freebie now everybody's gonna

410
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,789
be afraid of the freebies that I give

411
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,110
out you guys those are the same things

412
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,819
that I put in packages

413
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,539
I'm just generous and I like to give

414
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,070
extra

415
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,809
so when you get a freebie from me it's

416
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,490
the same [ __ ] that went in the packaging

417
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,379
I just put it in a plastic baggie

418
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,539
instead of putting an insert in there

419
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,340
and I saved myself a buck and you get

420
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:48,110
free seeds so don't be afraid of my

421
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,360
freebies but those random freebies that

422
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,250
come from vendors sometimes those are

423
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,539
just random freebies for a reason

424
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,679
because they want to make it look like

425
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,029
you got something but they're just

426
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,479
giving you a seed that's a piece of [ __ ]

427
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,889
so be a little weary of that sometimes

428
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,450
unless it's from a reputable breeder I

429
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,919
don't know who these Diesel Pakistanis

430
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,379
came from so I shouldn't even talk like

431
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,240
that but a lot of times free stuff is

432
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:10,580
problematic in this industry and that's

433
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,639
unfortunate so I'm going to say that

434
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,960
your problem was probably these Diesel

435
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,549
Pakistani seeds

436
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,650
since the bodhi stuff didn't herm I'm

437
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:20,839
not going to blame the issue on that

438
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,360
green light until recently it's been

439
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,490
believed that plants do not absorb the

440
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,190
green light they are green so they

441
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,480
should in turn reflect green light but

442
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,580
there has been some argument recently

443
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,620
that the green light does have some use

444
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,900
and it may cause problems but your green

445
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,730
light was very minimal and I do not

446
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,799
think it was the culprit I am really

447
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,110
going to blame this on questionable

448
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,029
genetics so if you have any more of

449
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,590
those diesel Pakistani seeds I would

450
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,059
probably get rid of them I would feed

451
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,920
those to a bird I would feed them to a

452
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,049
squirrel I just would not grow them

453
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,149
however I would highly recommend you

454
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:55,219
grow more of the Bodi seeds if you have

455
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,350
more of those plant those grow those

456
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,240
that is good [ __ ] and if you need more

457
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,730
seeds you can get them through Oregon

458
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,919
elite seeds dot-com they carry Bodhi

459
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,630
seeds they carry I read genetics seeds

460
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,730
and they've got seeds from all of your

461
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,230
favorite breeders hey I want to thank

462
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,209
you again for a great email that was

463

up the great work

477
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:41,509
the email goes on to say seriously I do

478
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,639
not listen to a lot of podcasts but I

479
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,279
listen to pretty much only your show

480
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,280
religiously hey that feels great thanks

481
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,779
for being a dedicated follower I think

482
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,849
the correct words for that thank you

483
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,160
that means a lot to me so the message

484
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,799
goes on and it says I'm wondering if you

485
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,279
have any thoughts on the pros vs. cons

486
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:03,409
of decarboxylation outside of making

487
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,299
cannabinoids active for edibles I have

488
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,690
read that it also makes the flowers

489
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:11,089
stronger for smoking is that true take a

490
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,509
fat dab and give your mom a hug for me

491
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:16,549
signed J and then they say PS long live

492
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,950

494
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:24,970
let's talk about decarboxylation briefly

495
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,680
honestly decarboxylation is not

496
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,410
something I am super educated or

497
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,450
informed on decarboxylation is more

498
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,910
something done in the edibles game I'm

499
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,680
not an edible maker so I don't have too

500
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,350
much practice at this but I do know a

501
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,950
little bit about cannabis and about our

502
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,569
bodies the goal of decarboxylation as

503
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,309
mentioned earlier in this email is to

504
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:50,529
actually make the cannabinoids more

505
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:53,079
bioavailable when consumed the main way

506
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,879
decarboxylation happens is through heat

507
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,309
cannabis flowers and/or concentrates can

508
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,070
be heated to specific temperatures to

509
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,579
activate the cannabinoids for specific

510
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:07,339
effects now I am honestly not educated

511
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:09,470
in the knowledge of D carving at

512
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,240
specific temperatures for desired

513
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,660
effects but I know that that is a thing

514
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,569
now decarboxylation happens through heat

515
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,370
so we take cannabis flowers or oils and

516
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:22,339
we heat them to a specific temperature

517
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:24,229
which makes them more bioavailable a lot

518
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:26,389
of times this would happen in our liver

519
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,490
inside of our bodies if we ate raw

520
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,740
cannabis by heating it up we are

521
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,240
speeding up that process so that when we

522
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,269
eat it we can get more of the

523
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,440
cannabinoids so d carbon is absolutely

524
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:41,089
useful in an edible product what I think

525
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,830
happens is when you are baking the

526
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,379
product I think you were doing a lot of

527
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:48,889
the D carving during that baking process

528
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,930
now if you want to eat an oil as just an

529
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,390
oil or use it as a mixing with something

530
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,640
else then it is wise to D Carr be role

531
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,650
first so if you're making like a brownie

532
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,170
or some cookies or something traditional

533
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,570
like that I do not believe in my opinion

534
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,029
that it is necessary to D carb

535
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,980
baking I think the baking will handle

536
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:09,769
that part for you if you are going to

537
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,019
use the oil or butter to make something

538
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:13,940
else and use the butter or oil as a

539
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,309
topping and it's not going to get rekt

540
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,680
then you may want to consider the D

541
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,109
carving process before putting the

542
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,180
cannabinoids into the fat carrier which

543
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:27,139
is your oil or your butter now when it

544
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,539
comes to D carving before smoking that

545
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,550
doesn't seem to be necessary to me

546
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,710
because what I've mentioned this whole

547
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,169
time is that decarboxylation happens

548
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,269
mainly through heat and again this is

549
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,670
not my wheelhouse I am nowhere near an

550
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,430
expert in this realm I am talking from

551
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,430
my my new amount of experience in this

552
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:49,730
realm but that D carving happens through

553
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,620
heat when we're smoking you're putting

554
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,099
fire to it so I think you are basically

555
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:56,449
instantly D carving it that way you're

556
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,759
activating it through fire so I don't

557
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,910
think a D carb is going to make smoke

558
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,619
product more potent again I am NOT an

559
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,480
expert in this department so if somebody

560
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,759
would like to email me and correct me I

561
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,920
love Corrections Corrections are a great

562
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,960
opportunity to learn something so feel

563
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,430
free send me an email grow from your

564
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,680
heart at hotmail.com this is an

565
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,170
opportunity for you to educate me and I

566
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,450
do appreciate that so the main portion

567
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,240
of this email was asking my opinion on

568
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,610
the pros vs. cons of D carving I

569
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,980
absolutely agree with D carving for

570
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:30,409
making an edible I don't find it

571
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,360
necessary for smoking flowers

572
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,670
alright this email was wrapped up with

573
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,740
the great slogan that says take a phat

574
