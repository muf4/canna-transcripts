10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,810
today I've got a jar of pre 98 bubba

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,250
kush batter that just smells amazing the

aroma is coming out of this jar are

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,119
earthy there is a hint of feet and a

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,160
hint of fuel and it definitely just

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,140
smells exactly what you would expect pre

16
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,538
98 bubba kush to smell like this is a

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,789
beautiful run of pre 98 bubba kush so

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,530
i've got the batter of pre 98 bubba kush

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,870
then i took some of the internally

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,539
flawless diamonds and i put a couple of

21
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,099
chunks of the IFS diamonds right into

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,890
the batter so I've got a pretty chunky

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,899
size dab of the batter with a couple of

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,909
nice chunks of the IFS diamonds in there

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,430
then I took that and I rubbed it around

26
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,950
and some of these star dogs Fambrough

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,229
Jie Terps when you buy a Fambrough jaar

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,840
jaar it's a 4 gram jar of the ambrosia

29
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:16,289
they give you a really nice portion of

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,969
the crystals the HCF se the high

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,189
cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

32
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,048
crystals but you also get a bunch of the

33
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,629
HT the high terpene full-spectrum

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,970
extract sauce at the bottom of it I feel

35
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,280
like I quite often have a lot of that

36
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,438
Terp sauce left over so I took the

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,509
battery dab that has the crystals in it

38
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,429
and I just used it as a mop to kind of

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,939
sweep up some of those leftover star dog

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,549
turps

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,758
so that gives me this pre 98 bubba kush

42
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,560
battery base with a big internally

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,420
flawless diamond sprinkled on top of

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,368
that the internally flawless series

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,500
diamonds by the way are let's see what

46
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,590
the label says here this says eighty-two

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,049
point five percent THC and a total of 94

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,100
percent total cannabinoids these look

49
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,500
like little

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,449
kind of look like ice cubes or diamonds

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,549
in the container they are internally

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,859
flawless diamonds and they are beautiful

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,610
they don't have much flavor but they do

54
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,348
pack a serious punch with potency so I

55
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,239
chisel off a little bit of the diamonds

56
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,439
I mix that up into the batter that makes

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,390
the batter more potent

58
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,069
it also adds some flavor to those

59
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,409
diamonds because they don't have a lot

60
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,789
of flavor themselves then I mop up that

61
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,919
star dog Terp with that little

62
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,780
concoction there the star dog chirps

63
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,369
absorb right into that batter you can

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,020
watch it all just become one nice little

65
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,480
puddle and my giant dabber which is

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,480
basically a shovel at this point and the

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,699
high from this dab you guys is

68
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,399
tremendous first of all when it hits you

69
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:41,609
you get a blast of star dog chirps its

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,550
gassy it is fuelie it is funky there's a

71
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,680
hint of maybe some sort of candied fruit

72
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,330
in the background just a very faint hint

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,879
and then as soon as it hits your tongue

74
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,010
real well that pre 98 bubba kush

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,009
earthiness just takes over so you have

76
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:58,469
this fuelie earthy beautiful savory

77
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,239
flavor on your tongue then before you

78
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,669
even start exhaling before we start

79
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,140
blowing out that fat dad I start feeling

80
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,609
the star dog get right in the middle my

81
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,409

84
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,039
feel that pre 98 bubba kush rest across

85
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,360
my shoulders and it just says hey relax

86
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,620
a little bit and it kind of you know

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,700
somebody comes up from behind you and

88
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,349
they give you that little rub on the

89
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,609
shoulders the two thumbs right there in

90
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,109

91
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,280
your shoulders they push their fingers

92
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,900
into your little neck muscles right

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,340

94

95

110
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,129
it's a really great combo then it lasts

111
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,810
super long because I'm putting that IFS

112
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,120
diamond in there I'm just pumping a lot

113

116
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,079
it while I was talking about I was

117
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,269
actually kind of building myself a dab

118
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,639
I usually don't dab on the podcast but

119
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,949
let's take a DAB together on this

120
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,168
episode you guys this is not going to be

121
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,779
a grow lesson in this episode I plan to

122
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,310
talk about my website I plan to talk

123
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,099
about iTunes and stitcher and Google

124
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,620
and also we're going to read some iTunes

125
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,360
customer reviews depending on how much

126
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,370
time we've got after that we may jump

127
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,470
into some emails we may just ramble a

128
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,870
little bit but in the meantime let's

129
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,280
take a DAB together I think I've got

130
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,170
everything I need for a DAB I've got a

131
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,959
rig I've got a torch I've got a fat dad

132
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,750
prepared here is a carb cap I'm going to

133
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,189
do my best to take this dab and not bump

134
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,959
the rig on the microphone and not do

135
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,850
anything ridiculous like that you may

136
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,500
catch a couple of seconds of silence I'm

137
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,660
not sure what's going to happen when I

138
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,730
start heating the nail with the torch

139
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,650
the torch may make the recording

140
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,390
equipment go crazy let me adjust a knob

141
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,219
here on the compressor this may help us

142
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,750
out just a little bit all right I'm

143
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,220
gonna heat the nail I'm not sure what's

144
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,240
gonna happen when the torch comes on oh

145
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,470
it doesn't sound too bad in the

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,269
headphones I hope it doesn't sound like

147
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,770
[ __ ] to you guys I think if I keep

148
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:16,209
talking it will cut out the noise of

149
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,399
that torch so we only have to go for a

150
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,930
few seconds I hope you guys are taking a

151

165
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,379
the last dab I took feel like that's hot

166
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,790
enough alright look at a timer we'll

167
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:52,719
give it a countdown and when we get to

168
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,370
the right time we will take a dab I need

169
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,070
to wait about 50 seconds with as much

170
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,899
heat as I put on it usually I could talk

171
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,610
away for 50 seconds and it wouldn't feel

172
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,859
like a big deal but suddenly since I

173
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,300
have 50 seconds of time to cover I don't

174
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,069
have anything to say maybe this will

175
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,660
work if you guys would like to support

176

favorite service also I added the

236
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,269
podcast to Google Play I'm trying to get

237
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,279
the podcast out there as much as I can

238
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:32,129
and I thought throwing it in Google Play

239
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,500
would be beneficial Google Play gives me

240
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,120
a lot of good analytics so I'll be able

241
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,679
to watch that over the next month and

242
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,929
we'll see how many people listen over

243
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,239

00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,839
laugh while listening to him talk keep

I like that you said Rasta Jeff is

311
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,929
extremely knowledgeable about the topics

312
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,730
thank you I tried to do a little bit of

313
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,199
research before I go on I try to know

314
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,480
what I'm talking about and if I don't

315
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,310
know a topic I am happy you're just

316
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,690
saying I don't know than trying to fake

317
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,489
my way through and teaching you some

318
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,080
[ __ ] so thanks for noticing that I

319
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,659
am extremely knowledgeable about the

320
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,490
topics I choose and also you said that

321
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,860
you get a good laugh out of listening to

322
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,659
me that means a lot because I think it's

323
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,940
much easier to learn when you can laugh

324
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,319
and have fun when I went to school I was

325
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,790
not a very good student I had a couple

326
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,440
of teachers that actually went out of

327
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:40,269
their way to educate me they realize

328
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,650
that I was a smart kid I just didn't

329
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,539
like learning the way most other kids

330
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,889
learn so I had a few teachers that did

331
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,049
step out of their comfort zone and

332
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,519
actually educate me but most of the time

333
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,199
I just felt like I was being force-fed

334
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,120
some information so that I can pass a

335
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,410
test to make the teachers look good they

336
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,750
weren't really teaching me anything that

337
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:58,209
I needed to learn so I'm here teaching

338
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,309
something I know how I hated learning I

339
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,200
hated being force-fed information in a

340
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,639
condescending tone so I feel like if we

341
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
laugh and if we have a good time and if

342
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,059
we appreciate each other I think you

343
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,860
guys really learn a lot that's why I

344
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,869
kind of I feel like I repeat myself and

345
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,250
they reiterate things sometimes but

346
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,980
that's because people learn in different

347
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,960
ways sometimes I can say the same thing

348
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,940
three or four different ways and the

349
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,590
first three times I said it a certain

350
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,690
person may not get it but on that fourth

351
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,430
time I may just word it just in a

352
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,560
different order and it may all make

353
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:27,969
sense to them so so that's why I kind of

354
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,649
repeat myself a little bit but also

355
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,600
that's why I tell a few jokes that's why

356
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,250
I try to keep it fun I'm not a super

357
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,230
serious uptight guy when it comes to

358
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,970
learning I feel like we all can learn

359
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,590
better if we can relax you can let your

360
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,210
guard down you can smile a little bit

361
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,740
you want to learn more from your friends

362
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,570
than some [ __ ] preaching at you and

363
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,279
giving you a lecture so thank you for

364
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,330
noticing that I know what I'm talking

365
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,919
about and I've taken some time to

366
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,810
actually understand what I'm trying to

367
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,309
teach you and also thank you for

368
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:54,009
noticing that I'm trying to have a good

369
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:57,519
time and keep it fun while educating all

370
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:59,588
of my friends all right this next iTunes

371
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,610

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,580

383
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,440
of an audiophile

384
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,910
that means a lot to me just those few

385
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,010
words in a row right there your show

386
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,449
hits my ear just right that means I've

387
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,710
got all the knobs dialed in that means

388
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,990
I've got all the equipment just right

389
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,790
that means a lot to me because I spent a

390
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,830
lot of time dialing in the sound and

391
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,899
making sure that it sounds great I can't

392
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,550
listen to a podcast with poor quality so

393
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,590
thank you you're already starting off

394

I'm glad you are always learning

399
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,970
something and do trust me I will keep up

403
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,509
daddio 45 let's move into the next

404
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,759
review the headline of this one is stay

405
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,490
Irie and they gave us five stars this

406
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,289
one comes from our friend Tommy Tommy

407
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,379
says I couldn't be happier that I

408
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:19,240
stumbled upon this podcast the

409
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,759
information is consistent the material

410
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,399
is new and engaging weekly the personal

411
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,230
touch he gives is top-notch the key to

412
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,870
learning is being able to relate with

413
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,300
your vivid descriptions and examples we

414
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,039
are all able to relate you are helping

415
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,579
to eradicate the stigma surrounding

416
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,439
cannabis walk good man

417
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,480
that is a great review that means a lot

418
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,970
to me that tells me that I am hitting my

419
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,370
goal one of my goals when I started this

420
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,129
show was to help eradicate the stigma

421
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,629
around cannabis back in the day part of

422
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,519
the intro used to say if you're a new

423
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,809
smoker if you're a new grower if you're

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,189
a cannabis activists or if you're

425
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,379
someone who's just curious about the

426
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,450
current state of cannabis I said that

427
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,820
because I want everybody to relate to

428
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,400
this show I want you as a professional

429
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,080
grower or you as a heavy consumer to be

430
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,699
able to listen to this podcast with your

431
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,280
mom or your grandma and say hey listen

432
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,140
this guy is fairly intelligent he speaks

433
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,879
fairly well and he smokes a ton of

434
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,679
cannabis and listen to the things he

435
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,360
says he's representing this plant in a

436
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,159
positive light and he's taking the fear

437
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,050
out of it that was part of my mission

438
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,240
when I started so thank you that is HUGE

439
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:25,059
let's see the information is consistent

440
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,350
yes I try to be consistent I bragged a

441
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,659
while back that I have not missed a

442
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,300
Monday in five years there was a

443
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:32,199
technical glitch in the website so I did

444
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,299
technically miss

445
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,190
Monday but I had a recorded episode it

446
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,259
was posted it just would not make it to

447
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,670
the Internet so I had an episode it was

448
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,710
on YouTube so I'm gonna see I didn't

449
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:43,419
miss a Monday but I try to be consistent

450
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,280
I think consistency is key when it comes

451
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,649
to podcasting and developing an audience

452
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,230
the material is new and engaging yes

453
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,699
there is a lot of information to talk

454
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,009
about when it comes to growing I will

455
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,720
never run out of growing info so I will

456
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:57,850
always have new and engaging material

457
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,740
thank you for noticing that the personal

458
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,019
touch just comes naturally I have a good

459
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,490
time wherever I am whatever I'm doing so

460
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,679
you're always gonna get a little bit of

461
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,240
Rasta jet flavor no matter what I'm

462
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,979
doing if I'm doing a podcast if I'm

463
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,930
doing a YouTube video if I'm doing a

464
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,310
seminar if I'm doing some consulting you

465
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,929
always get a little bit of Rasta Jeff

466
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,369
personality in that that's just how it

467
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,599
goes when you're working with me so I'm

468
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,129
glad you enjoy it I'm glad you

469
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,269
appreciate it and I'm glad we're kind of

470
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,490
connecting it feels like I'm making

471
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,590
friends through the podcast when I meet

472
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,879

473
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,129
walk up to me and you'll say hey I'm

474
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,750

475
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,610

476
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,750
Tommy and I bake oh dude I almost know

477
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,710
who you are it feels like we've been

478
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,990
hanging out because we've corresponded

479
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,310
so much through messages and I've read

480
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,840
your reviews and you know so much about

481
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,250
me because I spill it all out right here

482
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,570
on the show so it feels like we've

483
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,860
already broken the ice and we can just

484
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,450
hang out when we meet each other so

485
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,310
that's a lot of fun I'm glad we're

486
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,350
connecting on that sort of level

487
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,429
I'm glad we're able to relate which is

488
