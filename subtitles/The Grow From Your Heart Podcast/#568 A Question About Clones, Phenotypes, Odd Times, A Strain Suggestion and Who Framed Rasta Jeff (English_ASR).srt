27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,558
off by talking about what i'm smoking

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519

full spectrum extract from green dot

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,039

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,719
hsb the hsb is han solo burger

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,479
on the package the flavor is described

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,039
as 98 octane

35
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,759
dumpster and funk that is completely

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
accurate

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
when i crack this open it smells like a

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
hot bar

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
trash can that doesn't sound like a

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
pleasant description but i

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,520
love it there is some hot bar trash can

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,000
what is the other one in here 98 octane

43
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,599
i'm not sure the specific octane but i

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,400
definitely get a funky

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,959
gassy feely aroma so the description of

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
98 octane dumpster and funk

47
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,158
is completely accurate it smells like a

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,719
garlicky

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
dumpster fire and i [ __ ] love it on

50

120
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
of the show all right i don't wanna

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
waste too much time i'm obviously nice

122
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
and chattery let's jump right into the

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,039
patreon messages uh actually before we

124
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
get there i've got an update i almost

125
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,000
skipped a part it says update right here

126
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
on my page

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,959
in a previous episode i spoke about

128
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,719
grafting and i said that i believe

129
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
that when we do grafting and i said i

130
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,199
have no science behind this i said i've

131
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,959
got no uh

132
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,798
no actual experience in this i said this

133
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
was my belief and my assumption i

134
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
believe that if we graft

135
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,519
two plants together eventually over time

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
those genetics will

137
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
intermingle or meld or shift somehow to

138
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
where

139
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
that is one plant and i think the

140
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,720
genetics will change the outcome the

141
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,600
flowers the fruits of that plant will be

142
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,639
different over time many people

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
disagreed with me

144
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,680
many people said that that was not a

145
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,199
thing that the genetics will stay true

146
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,639
to each branch of the plant if you

147
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
carefully label it you'll know what it

148
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
is forever

149
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,239
well i had another listener actually tag

150
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,638
me in an article

151
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
and send me a link to an article where

152
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
it showed evidence of

153
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
a plant changing its genetics the plant

154
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,478
used was a tobacco plant

155
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,639
but it did show that some genes did move

156
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,039
around so big shout out to my buddy big

157
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
huff

158
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
for tagging me in an article and

159
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,839
pointing out the fact that i may have

160
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
been correct the first time in my

161
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,599
assumption and believing

162
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,439
that if you graft a plant over time

163
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,479
eventually those genetics could

164
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,240
and possibly will mingle or meld or

165
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,079
whatever the scientific word is for that

166
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
i am being honest and open that i do not

167
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,918
have the scientific education or

168
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,038
terminology for this scenario

169
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,519
but in my grower knowledge mind i feel

170
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,038
like

171
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,198
those genetics would definitely move

172
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,560
around if you cut off if i cut off your

173
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
arm if we traded arms

174
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
cut off we're gonna go with uh we're

175
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,199
gonna do left leg i don't if i had to

176
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
lose a limb i would choose my left leg

177
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,600
that's a drummer thing uh cut off our

178
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,198
left legs you get my left leg i get your

179
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
left leg we're gonna walk funny because

180
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,439
i'm six

181
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,960
five i got long ass legs you probably

182
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,038
don't have legs as long as mine i'm

183
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,799
gonna walk funny you're gonna walk funny

184
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,079
over time your leg and my leg which is

185
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
we've traded i don't know what to call

186
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,439
these anymore but our new legs

187
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,638
are going to adapt and adjust to our

188
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,918
body it's not going to be your leg

189
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,199
anymore it's not going to be my leg

190
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,879
anymore it may still have

191
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,079
your jeans in it and my jeans in it but

192
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,439
it's going to become mine it's going to

193
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,199
be part of my body

194
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,959
i think 20 years from now if we're still

195
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
alive we won't even we'll still know

196
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,000
that we've got a leg transplant because

197
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
it's [ __ ] one's way longer

198
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
but our bodies will go that's my leg now

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,439
and it will be completely adjusted to it

200
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
our genetics will have melded in and

201
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,918
meshed in

202
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,439
we'll forget that that's somebody else's

203
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,359
leg our body will go that's my leg now

204
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,959
and you'll function just like your leg

205
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
this is all hypothetical don't take me

206
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,839
too seriously i think the plant will do

207
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
the same thing

208
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,519
oh you gave me a new arm let's move

209
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
around and those genetics that make it

210
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,839
cherry kush and those genetics that make

211
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
it purple

212
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,279
haze they will you'll somehow you're not

213
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
breeding but you're going to make a

214
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,079
cherry haze

215
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
sort of a thing out of that on accident

216
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
in my opinion and somebody has posted an

217
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
article that says that did happen

218
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,679
with different varietals of tobacco

219
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
plants so

220
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,918
my first assumption and belief has been

221
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
shown to have been accurate

222
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,038
i hope that stirred up more controversy

223
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
because i look forward to hearing

224
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,318
your feedback and your input on that

225
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,399
update

226
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
so when i said that i feel like grafting

227
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,519
will cause genetics to move i may have

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,959
been right in my original assumption

229
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,598
that was the short version of that long

230
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,279
ramble

231
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,199
now is the part when we're going to jump

232
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,679
into the patreon messages

233
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,360
on this episode and i mean it this time

234
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
this is not another false start

235
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,280
we're actually going to get into the

236
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,318
patreon messages the first one comes

237
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,159
from our friend tree

238
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759

239
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,439

you thank you that is an amazing gift i

247
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,439

on to it and inside of that frame is a

252
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
framed package of

253
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,598
orange gasm seeds and he said that that

254
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,519
orange gasm made his life easier and he

255
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,598
thanked me for making my life easier

256
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,598
he has no idea that the orange gasm has

257
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,120
made my life easier it's made my life

258

framed package that was beautiful it

266
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,038

appreciate it as well

279
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,960
uh it goes on to say it goes without

280
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,719
saying you've been a tremendous help in

281
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,079
making me a better grower

282
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
it's only right that i support you

283
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,000
financially after all you've done for me

284
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,439
i spend my weekdays alone

285
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,360
building and shipping squares and

286
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,240
rectangles from a small industrial

287
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
warehouse

288
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,799
it's the voices of rasta jeff scotty

289
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
guru and the dude that keep me company

290
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,679
uh man i love knowing that i'm keeping

291
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,120
you company and i think i have a good

292
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,319
hint at what you do all day because you

293
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
sent me a box

294
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
um man i'm glad that we were able to

295
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,278
keep you sane because that type of a job

296
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
would drive me crazy

297
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,399
i need some sort of variation some sort

298
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,759
of chaos in my life

299
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
so i'm glad that we're able to keep you

300
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,600
sane and thank you for noticing that

301
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,360
you've gotten a vast education from me

302
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,800
and made you a better grower that's my

303
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
goal knowing that i made you a better

304
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,519
grower

305
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
that is my goal i love the patreon

306
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,879
contributions don't get me wrong i love

307
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
financial support that makes life better

308
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,519
it makes things fun

309
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
but just knowing that somebody out there

310
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
is enjoying their garden more

311
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
having a more successful outcome that's

312
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
what the show was about in the first

313
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,799
place so that means a lot to me

314
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
i should keep moving because i am

315
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,639
[ __ ] rambly it says even though we've

316
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,120
never met i feel like i hang out with

317
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,720
you guys

318
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
all the time i get to learn and laugh

319
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,480
concurrently and to me it is worth my 10

320
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
dollars a month i know exactly what you

321
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,120
feel

322
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,799
i listen to a lot of podcasts as well

323
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
one of my favorite podcasts

324
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,319
maybe possibly one of my heads one of my

325
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,759
top five favorite podcast a couple of my

326
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
favorite podcasts actually have been

327
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,399
disrupted lately

328
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,879
uh the church of what's happening now

329
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
with joey diaz is done joey diaz has

330
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,919
moved back to

331
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
new jersey because uh there's no point

332
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,639
in being in la he doesn't have his

333
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
producer anymore

334
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,879

342
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,200

00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,799
every day via that podcast when that

344

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,120
with me

368
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,078
um i consume a lot of podcasts so i feel

369
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
the exact thing

370
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,239
and i actually since i hit a certain

371
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,159
tier on my patreon i have gone and

372
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
started contributing to other podcasts

373
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,719
that i enjoy

374
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
because i felt that it was time to give

375
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
back the karma so thank you for throwing

376

381
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,439

383

389
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720

391
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920

392
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,039
bucks from me but i did go do some

393
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,319
contributions because you guys are

394
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,120
hooking me up so fat

395
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,800
let's get back on track here at least a

396
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,919
little tiny bit it says i'm glad you

397
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,439
loved your frame

398
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,958
i wanted to make sure you received the

399
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
note was included with it

400
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,679
that was the most important part um the

401
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,759
note meant a lot to me the whole package

402
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,120
was beautiful and meant a lot to me

403
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,958
i knew that my mom was going to be

404
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,039
showing up in my house later that day

405
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,159
so i left the framed package and the

406
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,159
note laying

407
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,600
on the table where i knew she would walk

408
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,078
by and just curiously pick it up and

409
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,839
read it

410
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,278
and it was left out there invitingly she

411
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
wasn't invading space or anything by

412
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,759
reading that i left it there to be read

413
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,039
and she read it

414
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,240
and she told me later she's like whoever

415
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,919
wrote that is really nice that's a

416
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
really sweet thing for someone to say

417
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,199
and she even felt like the look on her

418
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
face i could see the sincerity that she

419
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,079
felt your note so

420
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,919
yeah that was really cool thank you i

421
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,399
did appreciate it i felt every word of

422
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,919
that

423
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,919
that stuff means a lot to me i do a lot

424
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,919
of work sometimes i don't realize

425
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,838
exactly how many lives i've touched so

426
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,599
your thank you note did go a long way

427
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,800
i'm building a new office space

428
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
i've been saying that for a couple of

429
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,240
weeks i needed some plants to harvest i

430
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,919
had my office was a grow room for a

431
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,278
minute you know things that breeders do

432
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,199
i'm going to rebuild the office space

433
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,559
and that will definitely go in a spot

434
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,759
where i look frequently

435
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,679
because i want to see that and be

436
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,278
reminded of that quite often it's going

437
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,319
to get its own dedicated little spot

438
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,240

465
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,958
series of questions that comes from our

466
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839

469
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,159
your podcast today and i'm sending you a

470
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,639
message i wanted to check that my 7.10

471
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,240
level is okay and if i would be included

472
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,879
in the shout outs i love your show

473
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
brother

474
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,278
best podcast by far that was the first

475
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,199
message from wyatt herb

476
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,600
uh yes brother i did receive your

477
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,519
contribution and the 7.10

478
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
level is exactly what you need to get a

479
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,278
shout out on the show

480
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,720
uh so shout out to wyatt herb i think

481
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,240
you did get a shout out at the start of

482
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,360
this show if you didn't it's coming up

483
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,959
i write them down at the start of the

484
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
show and i try to do about ten you did

485
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,919
get a shot at the start of this one

486
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,359
try to give about nine to twelve shout

487
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,919
outs depending on how long your names

488
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
are

489
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,039
so that's where the shout outs fall into

490
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
place you gotta throw down ten seven

491
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,159
dollars and ten cents on the patreon

492
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,439
and then i write down ten or twelve of

493
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,078
them at the start of each episode to

494
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,720
throw out

495
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,078
uh your patreon did make it uh this

496
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,278
one's showing too many people's names

497
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,120
reading through the paper up here

498
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,720
but your patreon message did make it and

504
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,600
you don't mind good sir

505
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,719
have you watched that danny carey drum

506
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,399
video numa

507
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
i asked you on your instagram live i

508
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,679
know you weren't a big tool fan

509
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,759
but every time you talk about drums i

510
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,000
think about how you must watch the solo

511
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,000
at 6 minutes and 30 seconds in is crazy

512
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,039
the time signature is nuts four counts

513
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
ain't happening

514
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,278
uh watch it for the craft that is a

515
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,039
great comment there is cannabis related

516
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,958
content in this question

517
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,399
um i am a huge musician a huge music fan

518
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,399
i've been playing the drums since i was

519
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
14 or 15 years old that's quite a bit of

520
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,519
time if you know how old i am by now

521
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,198
i've been playing for a while i can

522
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,078
count odd times i could get a good feel

523
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,198
for [ __ ]

524
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,120
um a lot of people sent me

525
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,799
that exact video i don't know what

526
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,240
happened that video must have gotten

527
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,919
popular must have been trending or

528
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
something on the same day that i said

529
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,439
something about the drums because

530
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,519
three or four people sent me that video

531
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
within a three or four day time period

532
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,278
also somebody that means a lot to me is

533
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,039
a huge tool fan i thought it would be

534
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,039
time to give that song a listen

535
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,120
and learn it a little bit i've got the

536
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,000
idea of this song but i don't have all

537
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
of the parts

538
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,039
memorized and comfortably figured out

539
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,320
but i know

540
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,078
i can count it i know the time

541
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
signatures i know the pieces i know the

542
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,638
changes

543
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,919
it's just comfortably flowing with that

544
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,480
is going to take me a minute but i can

545
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,879
do it

546
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,399
so i'm not there yet i can get to it

547
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,600
i'll be able to play the whole thing all

548
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,120
the way through that won't be a

549
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
too big of a deal in a year i'll be

550
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
knocking that out it may take a year

551
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,120
but it's only because i just get to play

552
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,919
a little bit practice on that just a

553
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,159
little bit but

554
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,519
uh yeah it's a fun song i'll get there i

555
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,278
know you guys this is not cannabis

556
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,360
related but it was a great question

557
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,198
uh so many people sent me that that

558
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,320
video all like within a week and i was

559
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,000
like this is a sign

560
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
and then you asked me hey have you tried

561
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,120
that and i was like i want to go [ __ ]

562
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,278
try this so i listened to it i wrote

563
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
down the exact date of the first time i

564
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,838
attempted to play it so i've got that

565
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,879
written down i think it was the fourth

566
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
of september

567
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,078
uh so that means by i don't know six

568
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
months from now i should have some solid

569
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,879
progress on it i know that sounds like a

570
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
long time but it is a

571
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,078
monster of a song it's gonna be a lot of

572
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
fun it'll be a lot of exercise

573
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,399
as well uh four counts ain't happening

574
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,919
that drum solo in the middle is all four

575
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,078
bro it's just a camouflaged

576
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,360
four it's a different feel the rest of

577
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
it is five

578
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,039
and six it's one two three four five six

579
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
one two three four five with a couple of

580
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,039
one

581
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,959
twos right in the middle there to [ __ ]

582
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,159
up the pattern let's get back on talking

583
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,559
about cannabis it says

584
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,759
i do have questions for you uh what are

585
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,919
the options for us

586
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
deep in prohibition land to buy legit

587
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,599
clones i've always wanted to grow

588
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,800
a real deal cut but i have no idea who

589
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
to trust or

590
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,078
if the stuff online is credible i'm in

591
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,198
i'm not even going to say your state

592
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,559
because i don't want to give any hints

593
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,758
of where you are

594
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,838
since you're talking about being in

595
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
prohibition land i'm in prohibition land

596
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,360
so the local scene is basically

597
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,279
non-existent i know i can try the trade

598
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
game but i'm not extremely handy in

599
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,558
forms etc

600
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,759
and i don't hear much about the online

601
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,399
clone sales at all

602
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,199
any help uh the clone game can be a

603
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,120
risky game

604
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,959
the only if you don't know other growers

605
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,678
if there's not a growing community in

606
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,120
your neighborhood

607
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
if you don't know anybody with clones

608
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,798
you're going to have to rely on the

609
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
internet

610
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,160
you're going to have to rely on forums

611
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
or social media or something that can be

612
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
risky

613
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,318
you don't know what you're going to get

614
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,798
i can almost guarantee you you're going

615
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,599
to get

616
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,200
spider mites powdery mildew thrips some

617
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,000
sort of fungus gnats or some sort of

618
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
problems

619
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,599
those always come free with clones

620
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,400
expect that that's just part of doing

621
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,399
business when it comes to getting clones

622
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
i don't recommend if you don't have a

623
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
trusted reliable

624
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
source i just don't recommend doing it

625
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,160
unless you're really desperate

626
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
and hard up for a new variety that you

627
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
really really need something new in the

628
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,240
garden

629
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
maybe go on a forum find somebody doing

630
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
it but you've got to trust the seller

631
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,440
and the sender that thing is going to

632
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
end up coming to you in the mail

633
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
did they label it so where it doesn't

634
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,319
look like it's a [ __ ] clone do they

635
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,679
package it safely to where it doesn't

636
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,720
look like it's a clone you don't want to

637
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,160
set yourself up

638
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,759
to get in trouble from somebody you

639
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,200
don't even know who's careless i like to

640
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,038
kind of vet people

641
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,558
learn how they do business see how they

642
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,079
do things how they do one thing is how

643
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,519
they do all things if they're sloppy in

644
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,798
one aspect they're going to be sloppy

645
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,279
when they send you [ __ ] don't deal

646
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,639
business

647
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,558
don't deal with them don't do business

648
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,600
with them they can put you in trouble

649
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,879
um i don't know what else to say for

650
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,079
damn i stuttered hard they're not even

651
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,520
going gonna edit i don't know what else

652
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,480
to tell you or to say

653
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,400
when it comes to uh getting clones like

654
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,240
be very careful like you said the

655
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
the forums and [ __ ] are gonna be your

656
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
best bet but who knows if those people

657
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
are even going to send you what you ask

658
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,200
for there's no reason

659
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,879
for somebody to fake you and say they've

660
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,319
got something but it's a good way to

661
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,840
make money if i know you're looking for

662
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,439
granddaddy purple clones i've got

663
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,038
granddaddy purple clones suddenly

664
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
if you're looking for lemon haze clones

665
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,000
i know i've got lemon haze clones

666
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,919
suddenly it's just how some people are

667
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,440
it's how that's gonna work so be very

668
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,400
careful when it comes to clone shopping

669
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
online

670
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
i don't have much advice for that i

671
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,919
would say find some grower friends

672
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
and trade cuts directly with them when

673
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
you get those cuts put them into

674
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
quarantine

675
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
treat them like they've got bugs treat

676
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,960
them for about two weeks in another room

677
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,558
if you can

678
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,400
treat them every third day with

679
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,319
different pesticides maybe combinations

680
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
of pesticides pay attention to them

681
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,599
treat them with the fungicide get rid of

682
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,599
all the problems they could come with

683
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,678
like i said clones come with free

684
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,879
problems so treat them for that

685
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
i'm trying to think of better advice

686
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
while i'm rambling um if you want real

687
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,279
deal cuts

688
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
i think the best way to do it is to shop

689
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,879
for s1

690
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
seeds of the cuts that you're hot for

691
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,960
this is basically

692
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,880
why i made golden goat feminized seeds

693
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
golden goat was a really popular cut

694
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
when i started

695
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,119
kind of coming up in the breeding game

696
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,038
and making seeds to give out in bulk

697
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,599
quantities to people golden goat was the

698
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,640
big

699
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,319
hot [ __ ] in my scene so i reversed the

700
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,160
golden goat my intention was

701
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,519
i can't send clones out to everybody but

702
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,558
i can get seeds to

703
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,480
everybody so if you get s-1 seeds

704
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,558
that is as close as you're going to get

705
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,279
to getting a clone of a certain cultivar

706
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,798
without

707
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,480
running the risk of having a clone

708
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,079
mailed to you without that clone not

709
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
being what you're told it is without

710
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,439
getting the bugs and problems that come

711
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,240
with the clone so i think

712
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,798
seeds are going to be the closest option

713
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,038
and again

714
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,158
s1 seeds are self seeds that's when you

715
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,000
take a cultivar

716
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,000
you treat it with a solution take the

717
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
pollen from that plant and put it on

718
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
another clone of the same plant

719
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,798
you've used two girl plants you treated

720
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
wanted with some magic

721
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,079
now those are going to make feminized

722
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
seeds you've got s1

723
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,119
feminized seeds no adulteration of the

724
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,559
genetics

725
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,639
it's going to be as close as you can

726
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,599
find to that strain without getting a

727
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
dirty clone

728
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,678
without outcrossing it or something like

729
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,240
that so i don't have good advice on

730
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
getting legit clones buying legit clones

731
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,599
if you're going to buy stuff like that

732
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,200
online be very careful you have to trust

733
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,879
the seller you have to trust the shipper

734
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,519
you put yourself in a lot of positions

735
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
that way

736
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,359
once you get the clone is it

737
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
contaminated infected infested and is it

738
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,399
even indeed what you are told it's

739
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,079
labeled as

740
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,320
that's a big gamble i would recommend

741
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,119
you get some feminized s1 seeds

742
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,599
from a reliable breeder from a reliable

743
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,599
seed

744
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,319
seller of course i do recommend seeds

745
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,599
herenow.com and use coupon code gfyh10

746
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,839
while you do that

747
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,439
if you want some blueberry cookies s

748

goes uh where are we

764
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,519
i'm moving i'm loving my irie genetics i

765
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,038
have four of your strains in my room now

766
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,720
and i couldn't be happier

767
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,319
thank you brother lots of love that is a

768
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,759
great compliment i want to know which

769
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,079
four you're growing and i would love

770
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,279
to see photos of those four you're

771
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,558
running four strains i want to know

772
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,599
which four you've got together

773
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,960
and i'm glad that you couldn't be

774
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,798
happier that means a lot to me i love

775
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
that my product is making you happy

776
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,960
then it says here's a great question do

777
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
you think i could get a blue raspberry

778
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,240
truffle fino

779
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,400
from a bebop seed since they have the

780
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
two strained combos and he means the two

781
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,120
same parents

782
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
or will the sex of the parents limit

783
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,000
what traits they can

784
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,159
express um so

785
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,440
the story here is blue raspberry truffle

786
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,600
is an arise

787
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
to blueberry cookies it's in a ryze male

788
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,319
pollinated a blueberry cookies

789
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,158
the bebop is the opposite i reversed

790
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,119
blueberry cookies to make pollen

791
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
and pollinated my female arise so you're

792
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,199
going to find

793
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,639
vast differences because the male was

794
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,200
completely different

795
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,038
the female arise and the male arise are

796
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
different plants if i was using

797
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,599
if they were both reversed and done that

798
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,959
way you'd find more common phenotypes

799
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,798
and you'd be more likely to find the

800
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,720
blue raspberry truffle in there

801
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,400
but since i used the female arise

802
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,839
that kind of takes away from the

803
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
opportunity to get the blue rat

804
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,720
you'll still find it but it's not the

805
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,239
same male that's too different it's a

806
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,440
different plant in the mix it's not the

807
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
male it's the female

808
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
which will carry different traits but it

809
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,639
is an opportunity it is a possibility

810
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,279
because you've still got those two

811
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,679
flavors in the mix

812
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,119
also you're going to see more of the

813
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
male most of the time you're going to

814
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,239
find more of the male

815
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
kind of carries the structure and the

816
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
shape a little bit so that's what you're

817
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,558
going to see different you're going to

818
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,960
see more of the blueberry cookies shape

819
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,399
and less of the arise shape in that

820
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
plant is what i think you're going to

821
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
find

822
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,400
so it is possible but since i used the

823
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
arise number four female and not the

824
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,960
king solomon male

825
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,240
you're going to see differences because

826
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
those are two different plants they're

827
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,599
from the same line the same progeny

828
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,079
but they're they're different they're

829
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,599
they were selected for different traits

830
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,639
so it is possible uh with the two strain

831
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,319
combos yes

832
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,759
but uh you'd be if you want the blue

833
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,240
raspberry truffle you'd be better off

834
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,839
getting

835
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,079
the blue raspberry truffle that's what i

836
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,678
think all right wyatt herb i think that

837
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,798
is the end of your message yes i've got

838
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,759
one more message to go

839
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,440
i want to thank you for the great

840
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,798
message again if anybody else out there

841

00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,440
your message right up

850
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,480
to the top i do have another message

851
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
that comes from a

852
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
long time patreon supporter this one

853
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
comes from mr glenn geroni

854
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,679
uh it says jeff you can obviously use my

855
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
name if this makes it to the podcast

856
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,759
that's good because when i hold up the

857
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
message

858
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,278
your name shows up real big through the

859
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,440
paper so

860
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,200
uh big shout out to glen geroni this

861
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,798
message goes like this

862
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,720
as i approach the first two rooms of my

863
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,200
commercial grow coming to the final date

864
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,159
i'm wondering whether or not to flush

865
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,679
with ph

866
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,919
ro water or just regular ro water

867
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
normally i add my newts and my ph is

868
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,038
right on the money

869
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,679
however i would prefer not to add ph

870
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,400
down to water if it is not necessary

871
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,519
ro is what we have to use due to small

872
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,120
amounts of aluminum

873
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,119
of aluminum in the well water

874
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,639
all right so our friend glenn jeroni is

875
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,839
coming up on their

876
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,520
uh what is it the uh the first

877
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,359
two rooms of their commercial grow

878
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,200
congratulations on the first harvest in

879
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,439
your commercial grow that's exciting

880
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
and he's wondering if he should flush

881
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,200
with ph

882
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
or not ph ro water he's using reverse

883
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,558
osmosis water

884
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,960
uh he says without adjusting the ph it

885
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,000
comes out at 6.9 to 7.2

886
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,759
that's just about neutral uh let's see

887
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,319
he's wondering if he should adjust the

888
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,319
ph to 5.9 to 6.1

889
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,240
normally he adds newts and the ph is

890
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,319
right on the money at 6.0

891
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,519
right now he doesn't want to add ph down

892
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,399
to the water if it's not

893
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,038
necessary i want to know if it will be

894
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,880
okay

895
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,720
to flush with the current ro water

896
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,559
when we're flushing we're basically

897
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
trying to rinse out

898
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,480
the medium that is holding the plants we

899
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,079
just want to get the soil the cocoa we

900
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,159
want to rinse that out so there's

901
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,359
nothing left for the plant to eat

902
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,278
so if you're using ro water

903
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,798
ro water will stop the plant from up

904
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,599
taking more nutrients

905
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,798
when the water is ph it is able to

906
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,798
uptake nutrients

907
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,079
if it is at the wrong ph it can't uptake

908
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,038
nutrients so it's not going to eat

909
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,158
anymore so

910
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,240
i don't find a reason to ph the flushing

911
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,159
water you're trying to make that plant

912
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,759
cannibalize itself and stop eating you

913
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,240
basically just want to get water through

914
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,480
there

915
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,159
so water on your normal this is

916
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,519
something i want to clear up as well i

917
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,559
say when we're flushing

918
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,599
feed clean water for two weeks until

919
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,079
it's harvest time

920
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,719
i don't mean water every day for two

921
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,240
weeks

922
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,519
and i'm sure glenn jeroni is smart

923
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,720
enough here for this this is for some

924
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,240
people that were confused when they were

925
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
listening what i mean is

926
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,319
water on your normal schedule if you're

927
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,679
going to harvest in 14 days

928
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,439
today water till you get about 20 runoff

929
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,840
wait for that plant to dry until it's

930
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,480
thirsty again then water until you get

931
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,959
20

932
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,038
runoff with just clean plain water that

933
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,600
will flush out the plants

934
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,359
i do not mean [ __ ] drown the plant

935
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,000
every day until it's running off 20

936
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,359
percent

937
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
that will kill your plant your plant

938
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,278
will be dead you won't get time to flush

939
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
it

940
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,640
four days into the flush phase it's

941
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
[ __ ] over you're gonna blame it on me

942
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,919
don't do that water it heavily until you

943
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,319
get 20

944
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,278
runoff let it dry up maybe even a little

945
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,278
extra dry

946
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,880
do it all over again you should get

947
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,480
three five times of that depending on

948
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
how often you water your plants you

949
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
should get three to five good [ __ ]

950
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,960
flushes out of that

951
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,639
and that will make your plants burn well

952
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,000
there's a lot of stuff that can go into

953
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
a flushing conversation

954
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
what are you trying to flush out a lot

955
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,240
of the stuff you're trying to flush out

956
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
has actually been turned into buds what

957
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,798
are you actually flushing you can't

958
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,319
remove the stuff from the buds

959
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,079
i don't think i'm not sure i'm still

960
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,359
learning still reading still digging

961
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,798
into that controversy

962
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,479
but we just want to clean the soil so

963
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,519
the plants will quit eating

964
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,720
um i think that not adjusting the ph

965
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,759
the plants aren't going to eat they're

966
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,120
going to drink still they're going to

967
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,720
get water but they're not going to

968
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,359
uptake any nutrients and that is our

969
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,839
goal so

970
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,038
i don't find it necessary to adjust the

971
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,439
ph of the water

972
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,720
at the end of the flowering phase that's

973
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
going to make it a lot easier in your

974
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,519
commercial grow that's going to save you

975
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,398
a step it's going to save you money on a

976
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,679
product

977
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,959
you don't have to put the pen in there

978
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,080
and stir it around and try to get it at

979
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,240
the right ph

980
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,480
i say go for it just water the [ __ ] out

981
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,880
of them all right the next question says

982
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,319
what feminized genetics does irie

983
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
genetics offer that you would recommend

984
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,119
for a commercial grow

985
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,639
i can create whatever environment each

986
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,359
particular cultivar needs with no

987
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
problems

988
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,398
i'm wanting quality first and quantity

989
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,839
second

990
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,519
uh you'll get both with the strain i'm

991
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,278
going to recommend so what do you

992
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,440
suggest i run of yours in

993
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,679
my commercial grow and he said feminize

994
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,480
seeds so right now i'm going to strongly

995
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,399
recommend orange gasm orange gasm is

996
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,759
the [ __ ] winner in a commercial grow

997
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,759
for feminized seeds

998
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,200
it puts out good fat harvest it doesn't

999
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,200
take super long to finish

1000
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,558
it's got mad bag of peel it smells like

1001
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
delicious oranges

1002
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,759
if you want to make concentrates out of

1003
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,359
it the concentrates just smell like

1004
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,919
[ __ ] orange candy

1005
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,359
it's easy to grow it it'll suck up a lot

1006
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,880
of nutrients though you got to feed the

1007
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,199
[ __ ] out of it but

1008
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,080
it can take abuse it can take all kinds

1009
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,840
of rooms

1010
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,839
if your room is too hot too cold too

1011
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,038
humid too dry it's going to be okay

1012
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,359
i heavily strongly highly recommend

1013
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,679
orange gasm from my feminine feminize

1014
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,240
lineup for your commercial grow

1015

1023
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,399
of my personal development

has been inspired by your episodes i am

1025
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:26,959

1026
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,520

1028
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,639

1059
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,558
