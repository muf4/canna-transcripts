57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,599
of [ __ ] I just uh don't showcase it as

58
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,399
much yeah alcohol really displays your

59
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,840
shitty side doesn't it [ __ ] yeah that's

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
why I don't drink too that's why I don't

trash now I'm in

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,000
trouble you can keep pretty much

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,039
anything under wraps until you get a

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,919
couple beers in you and then all of the

66
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,199
Demons come just pouring out that was my

67
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,079
thing well that's the thing it's a

68
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,639
depressant and it is a depressant that

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
doesn't help me much you know I quit

70
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,639
drinking when I got my medical marijuana

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,959
car

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,598
and I my life is easier happier when I

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,000
wake up I know where my money is I know

74
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:40,158
where my car is parked [ __ ] I appreciate

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,280
it I still drink occasionally like I'll

76
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:46,239
have a dois but for the most part I quit

77
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,680
like five or six years back just CU I

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,360
got really good at throwing up in bars

79
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,280
and I distinctly remember walking up a

80
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,959
flight of stairs it uh think it was the

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
Celtic in downtown Denver thinking like

82
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,959
yeah man like you didn't get any on you

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,560
you're a pro and I got about halfway up

84
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,199
the stairs and it dawned on me that

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,519
that's not something I wanted to be pro

86
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,560
at and like yeah this is just one of

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,599
those like now I feel weird cuz I'm like

88
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,280
25 and all my social life revolves

89
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,719
around the bars and the bar scene and it

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,360
was a little weird to step out of that

91
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,080
for a while but now it's just where I

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
live alcohol doesn't play a big role

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,799
yeah uh once I moved away from my party

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,239
town it was a lot easier for me to quit

95
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,200
drinking I lived in Lawrence Kansas for

96
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,680
a little while and it's just really easy

97
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,000
to be a spun in there and then I came

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,000
here where there's a lot of drinking and

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,479
I know everybody so that sucked me in a

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,759
little bit but once I realized what I

101
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,119
was doing uh I just gave it up I can

102
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,438
smoke all the weed I can handle I took a

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,438
gram dab last night like why would I

104
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:46,759
even need alcohol in my life at all he's

105
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,959
going to do another one tonight I'm

106
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,919
going to do it again tonight I filmed

107
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,680
myself taking a gr dab last night and

108
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,759
the video was very disappointing I put

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,719
the dab on the Dabber kind of wonky and

110
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,518
it just I it wasn't really that was not

111
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:59,280
an impressive video we're going to try

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,158
it again it'd be a fun video if we could

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,519
have like the account from Sesame Street

114
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:06,840
like photoshopped in there on one dab

115
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,400
two dab yeah it took me several inhales

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,680
and exhales to get that dab just

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,079
partially because the way I dropped it

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,959
on the nail I didn't time it right it

119

00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,959
were going to talk about Joey Diaz

137
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,360
before I got on this really huge

138
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,799
Sidetrack but I knew where we were I

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,879
knew where we were I know what we're

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
doing I know what we're doing dog just

141
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,038
like Joey knows what he's doing brother

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,879
man it was so good so that was I seen a

143
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:06,560
lot of Comedians and um Anthony jelnick

144
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,839
was one of my favorites but every second

145
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,680
of his act from the time he walks out to

146
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,239
the time he says thank you every second

147
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,600
of that is calculated yeah um I can see

148
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,079
him counting between jokes I can see his

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
mouth going one two three and he counts

150
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,198
to 11 and then he tells another joke

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
really yeah but I and so there's that

152
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,680
style you know what I mean he comes out

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,879
and that's like uh if that was a band

154
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,959
who would I compare that to that's like

155
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,759
Rush every note is they know they're

156
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,680
doing tonight every single note all the

157
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,759
way through jelnick did that uh Joey

158
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,840
Diaz came out and kind of had an idea of

159
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,120
what he was going to say and just

160
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,159
leveled us just being himself oh it was

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,160
so good most of that maybe he's told

162
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,400

417
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,919

uh the city staff and the city council

419
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:17,000

around waiting for the meeting to start

421
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,120

459
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,480

461

it like he didn't care that I was

469
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,919
watching him it was kind of awkward that

470
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,879
was funny through the whole meeting he

471
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,919
kept staring at my little group of

472
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,039
people so in a city council meeting they

473
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,599
do they have a little structure they

474
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,799
have their agenda meeting right at the

475
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,519
beginning and then they have like a

476
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,479
little they say the Pledge of Allegiance

477
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,480
and they pray and then uh they open up

478
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,000
the floor and they say they do public

479
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,800
comment and then right after that they

480
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,240
say thank you or they do City

481
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,318
contributions or something they called

482
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,039
it they call it public forum where

483
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,278
anyone from the public can speak for 5

484
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,000
minutes and then they have Council

485
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,439
commentary right after that where any of

486
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,958
the council members there was a part

487
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,279
right before that where the lady goes

488
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,638
this is the part where we would normally

489
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,439
say thanks to the people that have

490
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,039
contributed to the community last week

491
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,800
we did 101 luckily there are none this

492
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,519
week my little group chuckled and I go h

493
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,479
no shout outs on the episode this week

494
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,078
was what I said because I thought that

495
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,000
was funny so like Mike said after that

496
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,399
they let each council member speak so

497
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,879
the first council member speaks and he's

498
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,440
like so first off I want to say thanks

499
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,399
to this person and this person and I

500
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,560
chuckled a little bit I was like H and

501
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
the next one is like I want to say

502
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,838
thanks to this person so five people in

503
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,560
a row go and they all basically did

504
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,160
shout outs and by the fourth one I

505
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,480
giggled I giggled out loud and the girl

506
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,199
next to me Angela giggled and then Adam

507
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,318
leaned over and giggled and we were all

508
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,600
just like church giggling and Angela had

509
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,119
the balls to say it she goes shout outs

510
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,279
and we just couldn't even handle

511
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,519
ourselves anymore it was so funny Eva

512
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,838
Montoya wasn't at this meeting but her

513
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,959
little Council commentary for most of

514
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,279
the meetings

515
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,919
is it's blander than any advertising

516
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,079
you've ever heard it's just it's almost

517
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,919
a bulletin board reading session for a

518
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,319
bunch of random local events I mean her

519
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,520
shout outs are always come to The

520
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,079
Pinewood Derby or come down to the

521
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,279
softball game next week or we're doing

522
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,279
an East Side park cleanup like super

523
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,759
duper simple shout outs it's kind of fun

524
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,440
to watch every week the city council

525
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,000
does some shout outs bro there's like 20

526
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,919
minutes of solid like and big shout out

527
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,519
to and one one person goes and also

528
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,840
thanks to Mick it parks and wreck and

529
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,918
kept going and I was like oh they just

530
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,439
shouted out parks and wreck like they

531
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,840
did it like a real shout out it was

532
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,919
really [ __ ] funny so I thought that

533
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,439
was hilarious hilarious yeah if you're

534
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,240
there watching it's it's a play like

535
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,400
anything you would buy tickets to see

536
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,079
it's just a about stuff that's usually

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
really boring this may get me in trouble

538
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,558
but it's really funny um I don't even

539
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,159
know if I should say this you have to

540
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,480
address the president of city council as

541
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,640
Madam president you don't have to it's

542
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,880
not required the the city staff do it

543
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,520
out of respect like you call your very

544
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,720
condescending tone they they in a very

545
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,000
condescending tone a couple of them were

546
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,360
like yes [ __ ] Madam [ __ ] president

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,839
[ __ ] was like what they should have said

548
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,558
like they uh I owe a dollar I owe Five

549
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,079

556
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,400
it may have to may have to come after

557
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,720
Nature's green remedies gets a refill

558
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,200
but it'll happen yeah well there's been

559
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,919
quite a bit of controversy and like I

560
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,720
don't know friction I suppose you'd call

561
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,360
it between the city council and City

562
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,919
staff and members of city council d a

563
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,678
couple of months ago the council

564
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,120
commentary thing was like the politest

565
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,038
[ __ ] you no [ __ ] you that you have ever

566
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,119
heard um one of the city councilmen was

567
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,879
in the paper saying stuff two or three

568
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,038
of the other ones was doing was illegal

569
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,400
and he kept using the phrase Shadow

570
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:23,359
government and like they were ready like

571
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,440
I seriously was waiting for him to rise

572
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,719
up with ice piics like as soon as they

573
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
cut the camera feed one

574
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,558
night cameras are gone stab stab stab oh

575
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,038
I was sitting in a seat where I could

576
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,079
hear the whole production crew too that

577
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,558
was really a privilege being a nerd like

578
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,720
loving tech gear I was loving it oh yeah

579
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,119
I could see all the sound equipment I

580
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,640
could hear the camera crew behind me it

581
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,839
was awesome they're in that just one

582
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,640
door between me and them and you could

583
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:50,000
hear them five four three we're live it

584
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,400
was just neat watching it uh yeah I

585
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,279
picked those seats for a reason maybe I

586
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,720
posted a picture I posted a picture on

587
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,960
Instagram of myself uh that was on the I

588
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,240
was on the news and someone's like dude

590
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,279
expression was when uh the city council

president announced her resignation

592

that that picture was taken I can't

594
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,038

reaction footage for that shot though

council meeting uh Mike went and spoke

631
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:21,440
against the proposed ordinance that was

632
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,599
coming up uh we uh you want to tell us

633
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
how that went so that I don't have to

634
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:27,359
Fumble through fumble through it sure um

635
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:31,158
the proposed ordinance is still sitting

636
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:34,158
at the planning zoning level they are

637
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,720
what's called a recommending body um

638
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,039
they suggest things to the city council

639
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,079
and the city council can go run with

640
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,000
that idea or have them amend that idea

641
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,119
in some way or they can kill it all

642
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,640
together um usually city council tells

643
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:51,278
Planning and Zoning like hey we'd like

644
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,080
to see this and then they go work on

645
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,400
that it's my understanding that this is

646
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,960
not that kind of ordinance this is

647
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,200
something Planning and Zoning has been

648
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,720
working on as their own effort

649
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,278
to sort of show city council as a way to

650
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,960
solve some of the complaints they've

651
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,519
been receiving um essentially Planning

652
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,640
and Zoning is fired up because people

653
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,798
can see and smell pot and uh that's bad

654
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
as far as they're concerned and they

655
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,480
would like to come up with rules and

656
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,720
regulations so that no one ever sees or

657
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,079
smells pot and if you're trying to grow

658
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,880
your own marijuana or know someone that

659
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,278
is you can see how problematic that

660
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,880
might become if if you've got to get it

661
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:32,798
all the way back out of sight and out of

662
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,640
mind and you can't do that in your own

663
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,400
home um the problems with this ordinance

664
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,520
sort of spin out of control real rapidly

665
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,000
and uh we as far as the community goes I

666
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,918
think don't like it on every every part

667
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,679
of it as bad and uh so we tried to Rally

668
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,120
up people with the last episode and a

669
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,679
couple of other things to get down to

670
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,278
the meeting and this time we had a

671
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,038
pretty good show of support at the city

672
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,440
council meeting on Tuesday night um I

673
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,919
spoke during public forum and sort of

674
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,360
pleaded with him to think about how many

675
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,440
people in the city they're affecting

676
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,278
with these rules how many people's

677
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,320
rights under Amendment 20 or amend

678
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,480
amendment 64 would be restricted by

679
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,038
these rules I mean now all of a sudden

680
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,880
you've got roommates trying to figure

681
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,759
out who gets to exercise their

682
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,760
constitutional rights and who doesn't

683
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,720
because you can only exercise so many of

684
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,679
them at one time in a home with the plan

685
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,600
showed up with Statistics and counts he

686
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
told the city council how many patients

687
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,519
there are in the city and county he told

688
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,480
them how many of them have a caregiver

689
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,679
he told them how much it cost to make a

690
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,120
facility like they're required yeah uh

691
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,120
most of the people that spoke at city

692
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,479
council the city council kind of gave

693
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,119
them the look of yeah we've heard this

694
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,278
before and you're back again this week

695
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,558
thanks gotcha uh when Mike spoke they

696
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:45,960
all kind of sat up and they actually

697
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,200
leaned forward and listened I was paying

698
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,278
more attention to their faces and just

699
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
listening to Mike it uh they like it

700
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:54,278
when I speak a number of council members

701
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
have told me like thanks for having like

702
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:58,159
some data to back up what you're saying

703
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,360
or taking the time to read the entire

704
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,640
artic a difference they they get a lot

705
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,678
of rambling at them and like Angry

706
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,159
rambling and you know you're fired up

707
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,798
and you're passionate I'm not I'm not a

708
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,120
big fan of public speaking it makes me

709
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,558
incredibly nervous honestly I we did our

710
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,959
best to calm you down you said I'm

711
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,798
nervous as [ __ ] and so we just started

712
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,840
talking to him just

713
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:21,639
random what do you think about bacon you

714
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,158
just to focus out of it and nah but

715
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,520
somebody's got to do it and I've been

716
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,080
the one that's been biting that bullet

717
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,240
lately so I went down Tuesday night and

718
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,879
said my piece and honestly like usually

719
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,278
when people bring supporters down for

720
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,919
their issue like lately when the the

721
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,679
trash haulers speak there's like five or

722
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,440
10 trash haulers behind them that really

723
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,640
take a minute to cheer and clap um as

724
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,480
soon as the whoever's gotten up to speak

725
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,159
is done speaking and I have expected

726
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
what were there six or seven people

727
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,000
behind us with you guys maybe eight i'

728
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,640
say there's about eight of us eight plus

729
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,119
us I wasn't sure how well I did when I

730
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,360
get up and I start giving a speech

731
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,798
honestly I go into a weird little Zone

732
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,479
where I know what kind of what I'm

733
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,278
saying and I'm prepared to say you know

734
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,200
something specific but once I get up and

735
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,558
start talking there isn't a filter

736
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,558
between like brain mic and mouth mic

737
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,918
there's nobody being like don't cuss or

738
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,158
make sure you emphasize this it's all

739
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,960
there's too much adrenaline part did you

740
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,278
realize what you said at the end you

741
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,480
stood up and you said thank you for my

742
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,159
time and you walked away from him

743
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,000
that's um I mean that's the perfect

744
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,799
example like my heart's pounding so fast

745
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,759
and there's so muchen you me they knew

746
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,158
what you meant uh I know what you me you

747
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,558
meant hey you're welcome [ __ ]

748
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,000
essentially like you're welcome I I know

749
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:37,158
you don't have time to Google this did

750
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,159
it for you so by by coming out and

751
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,480
showing support and by you speaking and

752
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,960
there was another guy that went to

753
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,480
another meeting who spoke about his

754
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,798
family and how this was affecting them

755
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,360
in such a traumatic way uh do you did

756
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,558
you guys make a difference did we all

757
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,798
make a difference it's you said it's

758
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:57,798
been curbed for a while um okay guys so

759
00:25:53,798 --> 00:26:00,798
Monday we had a city meeting or starting

760
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,440
Monday or since Monday we've had a city

761
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,200
council meeting a Planning and Zoning

762
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,440
meeting and a County Commissioners

763
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,480
meeting at each one of those three

764
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,080
meetings they were discussing rules that

765
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,599
would take away your ability to grow in

766
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,480
your own home limit the amount of plants

767
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,240
you're you're growing to an arbitrary

768
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,919
number that they just picked they

769
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,960
decided I that that'll be enough good

770
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,038
enough we'll capitate 12 in the city or

771
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,840
16 or 18 in the county um and if you

772
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,398
live up in Bula and have 400 acres in

773
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,879
all of that's one property you can only

774
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,398
grow 18 plants there it doesn't matter

775
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,360
how many different residents are set up

776
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:36,439
on your property and none of that I mean

777
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,319

00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,278
what I had to say at all three meetings

808
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,278
and they appreciated me coming down and

809
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:50,319
saying my piece but when he got up and

810
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,839
spoke they hit the breakes hard and also

811
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,158
you opened up for this

812
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,519
guy and he was the headliner he was the

813
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,880
headliner essentially yes and uh so

814
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,558
what's come of your guys's work did they

815
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,120
stop it did they hesitate are they going

816
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,398

817
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,798
the vote again to do more

818
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,839
research

819
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,918
um I think for two weeks okay maybe

820
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,759
three watch the county commissioner's

821
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
website they post their agendas on

822
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,119
Fridays usually um their meetings are

823
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,558
usually Tuesdays so you get about five

824
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:26,239
days to check it out and it heads up um

825
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,839
the city has the Planning and Zoning

826
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,440

us that came to speak against and a

833
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:45,119
couple of people that came to speak for

834
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,558
will be sitting at the table while these

835
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,639
get redone that's something I kind of

836
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,319
wanted to ask you about that is huge you

837
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,278
said at at when you address city council

838
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,839
you actually said guys please find

839
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,079
somebody that knows what they're talking

840
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,000
about when you do this you looked them

841
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,599
straight in the face you're like you

842
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,319
guys don't know anything about we please

843
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,439
find somebody that knows what they're

844
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,918
talking about and put them on your

845
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,880
committee y uh I almost considered

846
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,480
volunteering or asking you how I get to

847
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,360
be a part of that because uh I am a

848
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,038
legal grower and I'm a caregiver I'm not

849
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,240
a black market guy I think I can set a

850
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:16,119
good

851
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,919
example more than once I've fantasized

852
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,319
about being able to like kidnap and Hood

853
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,960
a member of city government and like

854
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,200
sneak them through your backyard and be

855
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
like this is what it looks like when

856
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,319
it's done right this is what legal looks

857
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,480
like this is what following the rules

858
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,278
looks like Because unless you blown your

859
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,720
house up or you've set your garage on

860
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,200
fire or overloaded a Transformer behind

861
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,880
your house they've never come to your

862
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,319
home that was Mike's main point to city

863
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,399
council he said the guys you're messing

864
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,678
with are the not the medical caregivers

865
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,798
those are commercial Growers that are

866
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,120
making a weed crop you're making those

867
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,720
rules to enforce upon medical caregivers

868
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,839
and you're totally missing the point

869
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,640
yeah and I think they caught on I think

870
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,599
we've got more time to deal with it so

871
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,799
dude get on that committee work it out

872
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,278
let them know like yeah there's a

873
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:58,639
handful of us that are scrambling if

874
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,200
you're listening to this show and you

875
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,519
are interested in cannabis advocacy you

876
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,080
can find me on Twitter at Nemo punk5

877
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,640
just like it sounds n m o1 K15 or um I

878
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,720
just created a Facebook page it was

879
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,038
something somebody else at one of the

880
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,079
meetings brought up it would be great if

881
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,119
we had a Facebook page where we could

882
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,720
kind of kick out Community activism info

883
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,398
and organize people for when the

884
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,798
meetings are because all of that can be

885
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:26,759
very confusing and I know we're in an

886
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,278
anti- Facebook mood but uh I'm feel kind

887
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,240
of bad because I spaced the name of the

888
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:30,960
freaking Facebook page you can't

889
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,120
remember your own Facebook page I'm

890
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,679
pretty sure it's for sensible cannabis

891
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,558
laws or cannabis regulation I don't

892
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,798
remember how it worked saw I saw it the

893
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,278
other night I'm pretty sure that I don't

894
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,839
have a dab and there's one in Arms Reach

895
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,398
pull it up right my memories are further

896
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,119
than they should be let me let me cut

897
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,558
you off I know that uh for the listeners

898
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,839
this might sound like if you're out of

899
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,918
state or if you're out of peblo like

900
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,798
this is not like your you're like oh man

901
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,679
these guys are just talking about

902
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:56,839
Hometown stuff you guys got to watch

903
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,600
those City councilmen wherever you're at

904
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:02,439
a local politics is interesting because

905
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,918
it's the stuff that most affects you so

906
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,639
you should be kind of keeping an eye on

907
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,840
your local Council anyway and B if

908
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,319
you're trying to legalize marijuana on

909
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,638
any level getting the people that are

910
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,119
elected right above you is the place to

911
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,199
start yeah so that that was more what I

912
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,918
wanted to say I know that there's

913
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,319

enough commercials uh I like doing the

1008
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:34,440
commercials in the middle you don't like

1009
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,440
overload them at the start that's I

1010
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,800
think like listeners should like if you

1011
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,240
listen to a lot of podcasts like I do I

1012
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,159
like that you break it up and it's like

1013
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,638
you know what we're going to talk for a

1014
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,960
little bit we're going to get off that

1015
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,280
subject here's some more commercials

1016
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,599
it's like uh watching TV or something uh

1017
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,399
I learned to do them at the beginning

1018
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,960
like Rogan does yeah uh because uh if I

1019
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,199
prefer you don't but if you want to you

1020
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,159
can just skip right through them you

1021
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,199
just go about 2 minutes in you're right

1022
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,680
past all the five minutes unless he gets

1023
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,480
on it

1024
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,279
[ __ ] uh tent so if you look on my

1025
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,960
table I've not been paid for this yet

1026
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,280
but there may be in the future I ordered

1027
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,880
Nature Box dude I approve of nature box

1028
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,440
they do not sponsor the show in any way

1029
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,920
yet uh but that shit's awesome it tastes

1030
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,159
good it's good serving sizes uh I've

1031
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,838
been replacing my sugary desires with

1032
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,358
something from nature box and I feel

1033
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,000
better man my teeth aren't going to rot

1034
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,838

1036
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,880
that [ __ ] is good it's tasty I wouldn't

1037
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,639
go to the store and buy that because at

1038
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,079
the store this it's not like a paid

1039
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,078
commercial dude but this is the truth at

1040
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,680
the store there's chocolate covered this

1041

00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:41,519
I'm getting like a huge high off of one

1097

couple minutes like it it didn't hit me

1101

1102
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,160
not doing that today I got to work

1103
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,519
tonight

1104
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,759
but that's the thing is I need to know

1105
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:01,440
how do I get my hand some on some like

1106
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,800
mediocre weed unless I'm growing or

1107
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,119
finding it in the ditch

1108
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,318
somewhere my smartass answer is just go

1109
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,880
to The Dispensary because it's

1110
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:14,119
all just look at all their jars and pick

1111
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,680
the one that's SMS like

1112
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,119
hey or maybe you need something more

1113
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,318
high in CBD that's but also but less THC

1114
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,200
would be beneficial for you you're not

1115
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:27,519
alone here there are a ton of people

1116
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,598
that have either avoided marijuana

1117
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,400
because of the legalities or you know

1118
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,039
for whatever reason and are now walking

1119
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,480
into a dispensary going hm and yeah

1120
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,838
they've uh rookie cookie is the product

1121
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,159
name that sticks in my mind there was an

1122
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,119
article about it at The Denver Post not

1123
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,838
too long ago is that an actual Colorado

1124

1165

1169
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
are the same way too they used to be

1170
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,239
that's where I learned my [ __ ] was from

1171
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,358
my uncles that were potheads and party

1172
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,358
animals and now now they're like dude

1173
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,318
you're crazy that weed's too good like

1174
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,279
it's too good that's kind of funny yeah

1175
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,920
well and then you're going to get those

1176
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,119
guys that used to smoke eight joints and

1177
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,680
not get high back in the 70s because it

1178
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,200
was dirt weed and then then they come

1179
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,719
and they're like well [ __ ] I can smoke a

1180
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,039
whole joint why why would I even be

1181
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,838
worried about it and it's been 20 years

1182
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,159
so they have zero tolerance and all of a

1183
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,480
sudden they're thinking oh this is going

1184
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,598
to be the same thing as that [ __ ]

1185
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,318
dirt weed they go home roll a joint take

1186
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,440
five hits and get halfway through it and

1187
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,599
yeah by then it's too far the Colorado

1188
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,960
rules the laws say that they're supposed

1189
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,160
to have every product tested even the

1190
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,358
buds so they should have a THC level

1191
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,719
printed on the jars we're not there yet

1192
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:56,719
a lot of the shops aren't complying they

1193
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,879
just can't afford it and there's not

1194
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,559
enough testing facilities yeah right

1195
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,519
once we get to that point you need

1196
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:06,480
something like closer to 10 what you've

1197
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,759
been smoking is in the 20 range 20% yeah

1198
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,199
I've grown herb that's tested in the 27s

1199
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,079
Spence actually hit

1200
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,000
29 uh did he grow that he grew that yeah

1201
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,599
from was Ran's Rhino from seed The

1202
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,440
Spence grew shout out to the shout out

1203
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,960
to [ __ ] Spence yeah also shout out to

1204
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,079
Steep Hill Halen labs are the ones that

1205
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,199
test our stuff that was yeah they did a

1206
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,920
good job but but that's what I'm getting

1207
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:27,879
at is like there's just like I don't

1208
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,559
know you know I guess was more my

1209
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,760
question was like is there a strain that

1210
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:37,719
you would recommend to a newbie FL no

1211

1216
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,400
hybrid the cut that I have is I feel

1217
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,960
like it's a 50-50 hybrid uh it's not too

1218
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,519
overpowering it's got a good body high

1219
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,240
it's got a good head high but for me it

1220
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,519
doesn't hit me hard enough I almost got

1221
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,159
got rid of it but a lot of my friends

1222
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,400

1224
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,838

1243
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:48,400
Rogan's podcast and everybody's podcast

1244
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,279

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,400

1251
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,880
that we were talking about why doesn't

1252
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,880
that episode come out already but that's

1253
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,079
why it happened to me uh I hear Rogan

1254
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,000
and Diaz talk about it all the time uh

1255
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,839
and I think Nerdist even promotes nature

1256
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,280
box so they did a free thing they're

1257
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,639
like if you order now it's free you get

1258
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,280
a free box I didn't pay anything for

1259
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,759
this box of Munchies that were eating

1260
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,559

1263
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,280

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,679
we're going to put Mike on again um

1280
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,519
sorry back by popular we'll try to keep

1281
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,280
everybody awake while he talks um so

1282
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,838
save me a couple of minutes to uh read a

1283
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,400
couple of listener comments but tell us

1284
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,719
about the new cannabis news that you

1285
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,200
were uh telling me about when you first

1286
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:13,318
showed up to the house the local uh

1287
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:15,439
profits and such oh the the local PUO

1288
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:18,079
City budget came out this week and the

1289
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,159
city seems to think they're going to get

1290
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,760
500,000 worth of marijuana taxes just

1291
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,639
for the city next year yeah for the the

1292
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,800
actual city of clo but wait for the

1293
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,639
punch line the the punchline to that is

1294
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,240
is the the number that they're going to

1295
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,799
get next year is zero not 500,000 and

1296
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,318
it's zero instead of 500,000 because we

1297
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,559
don't have any marijuana businesses you

1298
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,119
actually have to actually have to have a

1299
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,559
marijuana business located in your city

1300
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,039
to enjoy taxes from those businesses and

1301
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,480
the PUO county has already made about

1302
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,558
500 Grand this year between the wreck

1303
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,318
shops and the medical shops the local

1304
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,800
tax and the little Kickback that the

1305
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,480
state sends on the Statewide tax now

1306
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,240
I've looked most of City Council in the

1307
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,240
face recently they seem like an

1308
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,799
intelligent group of people where are

1309
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,639
they predicting this money comes from if

1310
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,760
we're not allowed to have a dispensary

1311
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,400
the the city manager puts that budget

1312
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760
together and hands it to city council

1313
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,318
that's part of the meeting we saw the

1314
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,200
other night and so they're probably

1315
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,440
looking at it thinking the same thing

1316
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,118
everyone in peblo that read the

1317
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,480
chieftain today and the three of us are

1318
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,920
thinking is well if it's really zero

1319
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
because we don't have any marijuana

1320
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,599
businesses where's this 500,000 number

1321
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,400
coming from well I heard him the irony

1322
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,720
in that is I honestly I rarely go to

1323
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,079
City Council meetings and I will now um

1324
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,879
I'm an anxious person and I felt

1325
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,280
intimidated to go I've broken the ice

1326
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,680
and I'm not afraid anymore you'll see me

1327
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
there more often thank you um I don't

1328
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,358
know what I was going to say remind me

1329
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,318
where I was headed with that oh right at

1330
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,199
the beginning one of their first things

1331
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,199
was and we're proud to announce it last

1332
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:48,879
week where our budget was like

1333
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,639
$484,000 or million dollar short but

1334
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,800
we've presented to you a balanced budget

1335
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,879
this week and that's one of the things

1336
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,640
we fixed in our work sessions but they

1337
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,318
didn't really present a balanced budget

1338
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,759
now that they just revealed their secret

1339
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,800
they added in $500,000 that they're not

1340
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,720
going to get they made it up oh no what

1341
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,079
I'm a little worried about is if that

1342
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,679
500 Grand pot number was in there before

1343
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,240
they carved out the three and a half

1344
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,358
million or whatever that they carved out

1345
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,000
over the last week like they might have

1346
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:15,358
been 4 million short and they only

1347
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,960
filled the whole three and a half

1348
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,358
million worth because they're pretending

1349
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
there's another half million that's

1350
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,920
going to come out I don't know weedman's

1351
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,720
ass I don't know you have to have a pot

1352
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,440
store to get let a couple of

1353
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,039
dispensaries build within City Limits

1354
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:33,000
the license ing alone is 300 or I think

1355
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,599
it's like $3,000 for one uh each license

1356
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,559
you have to have several depending on

1357
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,680
what you're doing is five grand to the

1358
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,880
city and the state so it's essentially

1359
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,838
10 grand to do just a grow 10 grand to

1360
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,280
do the store 10 grand to do the hash

1361
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:49,440
making so if they open five shops they'd

1362
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,720
make 25gs right away minimum the city's

1363
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,760
already taking in about five shops would

1364
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,239
be 50 G's Oh you mean I see what you're

1365
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,920
saying split it but the problem with

1366
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,078
that though is is what they're worried

1367
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,280
about is that you can't just allow one

1368
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,240
cuz that's a monopoly and you can't just

1369
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,640
allow five cuz that's still a monopoly

1370
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,000
in my opinion you can't say oh you got

1371
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:09,920
here too late you're not allowed to

1372
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,880
start that's not the American way this

1373
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
town doesn't really need more than and

1374
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,240
this sounds ridiculous coming for me but

1375
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,559
if a shop did it right three or four

1376
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,159
shops would be more than enough for this

1377
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,480
city I agree but that's that's on the

1378
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,358
businesses to decide later like oh you

1379
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,880
know I don't think we can make money by

1380
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:27,318
starting one so yeah we're going to get

1381
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,000
influx of five and then all of a sudden

1382
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:31,358
it's going to be like wow we're we're

1383
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,599
we're all not doing great but this guy's

1384
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,440
not doing well at all and then he closes

1385
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,160
down and it's we're going to see that

1386
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,519
one of these days we're going to see the

1387
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:40,480
first pot shop closed down we're going

1388
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,119
to be like that's weird like if a liquor

1389
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,280
store goes out we're like oh we get it

1390
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,838
because there's a liquor store on every

1391
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,720
every

1392
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,400
corner excuse me you could do it bro can

1393
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,759
single-handedly cleaning up the airwaves

1394
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,680
for there we go no but what I'm saying

1395
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,920
is like we see a liquor store on every

1396
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,639
and there's a bar on every other one so

1397
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,200
we see all these liquor stores and the

1398
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:02,960
liquor store goes out we're like oh yeah

1399
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,639
of course it did There's super

1400
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,240
competition that's what's going to

1401
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,519
happen with weed and so prices are going

1402
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,199
to have to start dropping and that's

1403
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,559
better for everybody yep that's in

1404
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,399

price dropping with medical over the

1423
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,558
last decade and then went January 1st

1424

1427
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:01,719
that's got $60 GS is that because of a

1428
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,119
supply and demand thing yeah that's the

1429
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:06,759
all all of the shops in Washington

1430
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,920
there's a very few shops that are open

1431
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,599
their supply is extremely limited they

1432
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,760
didn't have the time to bring in the

1433
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,160
crops before this all went live like

1434
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,240
with the licensing you weren't allowed

1435
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:19,440
to grow for very long before shops were

1436
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,519
allowed to open so they just haven't had

1437
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,838
any time in a year or two when you know

1438
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:26,559
shop numbers have risen significantly

1439
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,880
production numbers have you know had a

1440
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,400
Time to come in all of that'll change a

1441
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,200
bit but it's going to be a year or two

1442
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,440
before you can buy a reasonable Graham

1443
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,838

1444
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,760

00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,920
to uh man we figured it out man go to a

1464
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,798
dispensary tried to bring you some H you

1465
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,798
brought me some good weed I'm afraid see

1466
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:15,639
that's the thing is I'm always

1467
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:18,079
constantly afraid of like whatever I get

1468
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:19,598
too I'm like so so is this going to kill

1469
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,720
me like is this the one that sends me

1470
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,119
into like a a panic or something like

1471
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:26,399
that like unfortunately so far you know

1472
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:29,000
I've gotten really [ __ ] high and it

1473
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,680
has like I haven't had like this huge

1474
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,358
bad trip or anything like that then

1475
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,798
you're probably not going to no that's

1476
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:35,679
the thing is I can talk myself out of

1477
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,798
them because I know I'm on drugs right

1478
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,440
now I understand it's not well yeah no

1479
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:41,039
but I mean as high as you're getting it

1480
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
probably feels that way [ __ ] up man

1481
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,279
that's good you you need to be able to

1482
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,880
remind yourself that cannabis can't kill

1483
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,319
humans like no that's fine it's not been

1484
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,280
my Mantra before when you're too high

1485
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,880
now you're just killing cancer yeah [ __ ]

1486
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,400
yeah I ain't got cancer for [ __ ] if

1487
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,160
you're too high your Cancer's too high

1488
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,680
also and it's just going backwards going

1489
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,239
I don't know what to do I'm not cancer

1490
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,118
anymore and it just starts dying I'm

1491
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:04,919
making all of that

1492
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,480
up he's Jeff is not a doctor surprising

1493
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,318
guys know surprisingly you wouldn't you

1494
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,679
would never not count as a medical

1495
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,199
opinion so Clint is talking about

1496
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,039
getting too wrecked off of like a bowl

1497
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:16,960

1498
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:19,079

1499
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,000

1500
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,119

last night after that grham dab when I

1507
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,960

1508
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,559
on energy drugs I was jumping around and

1509

1514
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:54,480

1522
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,839
held up his rig and we started laughing

1523
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,239
like yeah taking dabs on chat roulette

1524

all right if you're into online chatting

1527
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,799
with other Stoners there's a thing

1528
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,798
called Puff Puff chat that I've heard

1529
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:24,838
about a number of places but I haven't

1530
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:26,920

1531
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:28,960

last time I got online for something

1542
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,039
that was designed for stoners to come

1543
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,920
together and get stoned on webcams

1544

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,039
to Brand it I guess I don't know it

1594
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,559
works well Tall Clint it works yeah yeah

1595
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,639
and I'm tall and I'm Clint I hope you

1596
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,079
don't think it's Cliff Griz Adams was

1597
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:46,838
taken it looked like another word the

1598
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,559
first time I saw it on there it did not

1599
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:51,480
look like it said Clint there's no n in

1600
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,880
the word you're thinking of or there is

1601
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,519
an n in the world think of you're

1602
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,000
thinking of when the L in the I become a

1603
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:58,358
u yes yeah that one's the L and the eye

1604
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,798
had United to a

1605
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:02,798
uu if if it was going to be in my name

1606
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,000
it makes complete sense that's why I

1607
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:05,880
thought I think I said that word on the

1608
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,280
show earlier actually yeah you did

1609
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,519
that's funny I may edit that word out

1610
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,640
that word never I've never said that on

1611
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:12,599
a podcast I can I can't say the f one

Charleson he's not just from Oregon or

award-winning flowers um I don't think

1684
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:42,759

1692
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,599
is where the good [ __ ] comes out I used

1693
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,318
to script almost everything I used to

1694
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,559
type out like a lot of what I was going

1695
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:02,119
to say and then I listened to the

1696
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,599
