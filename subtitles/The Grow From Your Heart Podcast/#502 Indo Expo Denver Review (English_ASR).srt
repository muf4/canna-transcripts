57
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,469
was gonna wait to talk about this but

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,690
since we kind of segue it into that

59
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,739
accidentally let's do an update on the

60
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,300
IRA genetics Instagram page recently I

61
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,430
discovered that Instagram [ __ ] up the

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,160
IRA genetics Instagram page and made it

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,360
Iowa's shadow band really strongly

64
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,810
then they changed it to where it was

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,110
only viewable by viewers who were 21 of

66
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,460
years of age or older then I discovered

67
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,140
that most people couldn't even see the

68
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,550
page at all so I went poking around and

69
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,079
found some settings I think I've

70
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,960
corrected some of the settings and you

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,880
should be able to view my Instagram page

72
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,170

it was so nice meeting people it was so

173
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:25,568

177
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:33,759
beep voice you know what I mean when we

178
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,959
talk about you being a tall guys I get

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,139
excited though and it gets a little

180
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,139
higher

181
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:45,050
I was forever known as helper monkey

182
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,789
yeah I had him just really funny

183
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,350
they give us four passes for the event

184
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,180
and I wasn't sure who was going to be my

185
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,379
fourth helper I had somebody I was

186
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,550
thinking about having helped me but then

187
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,310
I thought that Matt would be a better

188
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,750
fit so when I registered the badge I

189
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,860
just put the word helper monkey on there

190
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,829
because that's what they were gonna be

191
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,330
and we got away with that so it was all

192
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,709
cool I thought until I registered and I

193
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,089
got an email that said all right you're

194
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,129

215
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,979

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:50,839
stuff that hype doesn't get them Clint's

217
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,040
got other [ __ ] on his mind so when he

218
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,759
meets famous people is like hey you're

219
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,080

221
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
superstar star those at the time I don't

222
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,650
know and then everybody's just human so

223
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,029
yeah and when people some people would

224
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,129
meet me and get starstruck and I'd be

225
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:05,929
like no I got hungry today and I poop

226
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:08,600
today just like you like it was fun to

227
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,579
watch yeah sometimes people would come

228
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,110
to the booth and say hi and it would be

229
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:13,909
somebody from the industry that's like

230
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,199
that I find to be kind of you know

231
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,820
somebody to look up to somebody who's

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,529
important and these guys would have no

233
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,939
idea who the [ __ ] I'm talking to and

234
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,379
it'd be somebody that owns another seed

235
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,240
company that I've looked up to or

236
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,199
somebody that has inspired me and when

237
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,579
they would walk away and be like hey

238
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,889
Matt do you know who that was like no

239
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,539

240
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,000
that owns this company and he's like oh

241
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,259
my holy [ __ ] it was just these guys had

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,210
no idea who they were standing new

243
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,590
standing next to half the time and then

244
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,210
when they did it was funny to watch you

245
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,649
guys get kind of starstruck a couple of

246
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,450
times that was pretty fun especially

247
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,889
Matt cuz he's kind of silly younger than

248
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,230
me new to this those willing to watch

249
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,299
well I do follow a lot of the social

250
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,670
media stuff too so like you know I spent

251
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:51,559
like the last couple years just watching

252
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,809
like certain people's page and like to

253
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,969

254
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:56,849
it's like oh [ __ ] yeah they just just

255
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,649
awesome to come say hi like Oh a lot of

256
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,200
people to hide what they look like

257
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:03,569
really well off of their Instagram you

258
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,690
know purposely so you don't really have

259
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,070
an idea okay this is you know I love and

260
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,960
in her eyes you can know it's a girl

261
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,550
probably because you know it has sets

262
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,870
her in there but half of the other ones

263
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:15,329
you don't know it could be a guy could

264
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,740
be a girl it you know and so when you're

265
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,528
like hey you know who that was and I'm

266
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,850
like now who the [ __ ] was it yeah then

267
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm like well that was this personally

268
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,339
who the [ __ ] is that and I tell you

269
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,950
there's this on Instagram you're like oh

270
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,270
[ __ ] yeah yeah it's really funny like

271
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,640
trying to figure out and then I have

272
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:31,110
this thing where I'm not sure I know

273
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,939
people's real names

274
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,800
I know people's Instagram names and I

275
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,570
know their email addresses and sometimes

276
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,338
I'm talking to three different

277
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,660
conversations thinking it might be three

278
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,820
different people and then sometimes it

279
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,039
hits me that oh this guy is also this

280
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,480
guy is also this guy or sometimes I'm

281
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,250
thinking of talking but it's so hard to

282
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,470
keep all the social media and real and

283
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,610
email all those conversations like I

284
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,690
don't know maybe it's just me being

285
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,669
weird but it's hard to keep all those

286
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,380
names and faces together a lot of them I

287
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,329
don't have faces for until the end o

288
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:58,679
Expo so that's really fun like getting

289
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,810
to put a face to all these emails

290
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,250
finally is really nice oh yeah there was

291
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,939
a lot of people that came up and it's

292
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,980

297
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,580

without any hint of awareness that

441
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,429
Scotty in the Deuter standing 1618

442
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,799
inches behind yep if it happened twice

443

in an hour within an hour from each

444
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:25,349
other it was just a beautiful fun

445
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,850
convention thing that I just it's been

446
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,379
amusing me since it happened man I've

447
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,180
been smiling because of it so if you

448
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,470
don't watch the video show up the dude

449

gross show you don't know what the dude

450
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,889
and Scotty looked like

451
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,069
I don't know if they were primary

452
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:40,288
listeners or if they were just call it

453
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:42,028
in the spirit of the convention yeah and

454
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:43,859
not paying a lot of attention to who

455
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:46,288
else was right around them some people

456
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:48,179
were um heavily medicated might be the

457
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:49,528
words yeah you know it was really

458
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:52,438
convenient you want to tell them about

459
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:55,408
the discovery you made Mike but the the

460
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:57,298
gender segregated babe loans just yeah

461
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:59,129
about 40 feet from our booth yeah it was

462
00:15:57,298 --> 00:16:00,718
really interesting Mike pointed out that

463
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,489
there was a gender specific vape lounge

464
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:06,799
just to the right and I went in

465
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:10,469
allegedly allegedly mom said no there

466
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:12,629
I'm about 40 almost 40 years old I've

467
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:16,559
been to a lot of events in Colorado over

468
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:18,269
the last four decades and never once is

469
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:21,208
a bathroom ever smelled that nice you

470
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,649
know it was not a problem

471
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,528
you'd open that door and it looks like

472
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,818
well it's most kind of nice in here yeah

473
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:29,038
I couldn't figure out why there were a

474
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:31,678
bunch of urinals in the bait lounge but

475
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:33,509
I used them yeah I mean it was

476
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:35,698
convenient it was really nice it was

477

562
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,610

think I talked to my community I

570
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:47,549
attempted communication with that person

571
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,350
bro if you're listening it's okay yeah

572

like hugging the table and I'm like I I

580

Oban we got we got to talk with him for

668
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,049
a minute

669
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:22,519
he was cool as hell and there was a long

670
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,740
line behind us so I didn't want to take

671
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,269
up much of his time so yeah they did

672
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,640
we're good at that we noticed to shake

673
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,950
hands get out they gave us good seats

674
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,320
they and this was at this comedy work

675
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,259
south club yes the landmark not a normal

676
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,149
Club and it was nice seeing some faces

677
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:40,069
that I recognized from the other Club

678
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,690
that must just like go back and forth

679
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:43,159
that like a managerial level or

680
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,130
something right

681
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,200
those guys are cool new waitresses are

682
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,970
awesome I I don't know I hadn't been to

683
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,308
this club before so it was really fun to

684
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,160
go to this one it was a different

685
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:56,899
feeling there please different vibe as a

686
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,130
completely different feeling completely

687
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,350
different setup you're absolutely

688
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,630
correct there so that was my favorite

689
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:04,490
part I didn't mean to like take away

690
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,650
from these guys can't really comment on

691
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,240
it so it's tough to know I wanted to

692
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,679
have a good segue to talk about Theo

693
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,870
there's a note right here that says Theo

694
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,030
so yeah Friday I went and set up for the

695
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,558
Indo Expo I basically put up the banner

696
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,089
throw up a tablecloth and carried in a

697
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:18,889
box of shirts and then I met up with

698
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,809
Clint and we got to go see Theo

699
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,480
I thought it was a pretty good show the

700
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:25,789
crowd was disruptive the show was

701
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,839
disorganized chaos

702
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:31,759
was in disarray and that's exactly what

703
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,500
you expect when you go see Theo I think

704
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,900
that's probably it's like when you go

705
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,640
see buck in a baseball game you expect

706
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,470
to see dudes in baseball pants throwing

707
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,060
a ball and we I expected to see exactly

708
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,400
what I got when I went to go see Theo

709
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:45,940
yeah his haircut says what he's gonna be

710
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,110
doing on stage that is basically

711
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,910
absolutely all you gotta say about that

712
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:51,309
show that haircut tells you what you're

713
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:56,779
gonna get

714
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:58,159
okay yep that was fun we got some fun

715
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,359
meet Theo got a good picture with him he

716
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,800
took a couple of pictures with me

717
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,389
because the lighting wasn't right in the

718
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,460
first one so he went back for another

719
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,960
photo I've never had an artist actually

720
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,730
made sure that my photo was good before

721
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,440
us without school well we were first in

722
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,420
line so if he wanted to make sure that

723
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,890
everybody else's photos got I mean I

724
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,390
thought it was smart as hell just he

725
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,790
wanted to get the lighting right on you

726
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,440
so that way okay himself and the next

727
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,450
person in the right spot every time all

728
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,830
right that makes a lot more sense makes

729
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,440
more sense to me all right

730
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:27,619

758
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,170
Clint was the comedy show and all the

759
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:35,269

stood out yeah all the cool people

761
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,910
everybody had such a good vibe to him I

762
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,490
mean the whole event was

763
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,490
fairly well-run I didn't see any like

764
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,319
huge problems or anything like that but

765
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,599
there wasn't a lot of food going around

766
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,700
that could have been better maybe for

767
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,909
next year definitely could he use some

768
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,350
some food bending inside but I don't

769
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,000
know I think maybe we just didn't see it

770
00:26:55,349 --> 00:27:00,119
it was there were so many people there

771
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,140
so it was spot food finding inside would

772
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,779
take up boot space for exhibitors the

773
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,450
the expo was massive two days they tried

774
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:12,149
to walk around a little bit I ate I know

775
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,700
I only saw maybe 20% of it there's a

776
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,920
subway inside the place there's a cafe

777
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,090
inside the place so there's food we just

778
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,710
didn't fight you guys didn't find the

779
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,659
subway it's in there we were hanging out

780
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,090
of the booth it was fun I made it to the

781
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,310
booth into the men's vape lounge is as

782
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:28,019
far as I got all weekend I didn't get to

783
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,399
go see I want to go hang out with Colin

784
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,349
Gordon for a moment didn't get go see

785
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,240
him I wanted to go see a couple of

786
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,889
people I made a quick stop at the organ

787
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,420
elite seeds booth and the seeds here now

788
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,280
booth just to say hey what's up give

789
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,750
them hugs cuz we work together and I was

790
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,250
back to the booth as quickly as I could

791
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,259
I was nervous away from the booth that

792
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,940
felt like my post was left unmanned and

793
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,500
I trust you guys I know you got it but

794
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,230
I'm still like man I gotta be that my

795
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,970
face is on the [ __ ] banner yeah so I

796
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,980
was waiting to get back there it

797
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,950
honestly felt like a mad rush for seeds

798
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,200
this year as far as people going to like

799
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,910
just I had a cell for other people

800
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:05,819
mentioned that the crowds were good

801
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:08,040
around each seed booth yeah it was

802
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,419
people who were doing other stuff like

803
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:14,789
heavy high end extraction equipment

804
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,920
stuff like that and they pretty much all

805
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:18,299
uniformly mentioned like see seed

806
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,480
companies look like that's the hot spot

807
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,980
this month it's how those events that's

808
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,079
why they spread us out I don't know if

809
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,420
you noticed it was by every pretty

810
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,500
strategic sides in about three down from

811
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,420
each other every time there would be a

812
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,380
seed breeder they knew they knew what

813
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,570
they were getting into this was the

814
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,980
third or fifth and oh I really can't

815
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:36,750
remember how many there be there's so

816
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,089
many of these events and they do them in

817
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,759
the same building and so they all look

818
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:43,589
the same to me not to be a dentist but

819
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,200
it's just a bunch of boots with bucking

820
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,730
people and like the cup and the expo and

821
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,650
they all look the same by now so I don't

822
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,539
know how many there have been but you

823
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,740
have the seed breeders that's where it's

824
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,599
at we all got our fair

825
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,120
sher that's what I love that nobody like

826
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,589
we all had basically the same nice

827
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,579
amount of flow like I talked about like

828
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:01,409
their bands everyone's gonna like

829
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,909
certain bands and so nobody got all of

830
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,170
it nobody got left out that's pretty

831
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,880
cool that we all got a fair amount of

832
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,340

information please go back and listen

852
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,250
yes

853
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,309
target audience we were hitting them

854
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,750
they were there that day um one is some

855
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:50,519
of my favorite stuff at the event

856
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,140
I just loved all the people that wanted

857
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,250
to [ __ ] meet me bro that is really

858
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,410
cool it feels good I said it's

859
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,720
recharging it's overwhelming because

860
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,550
it's a lot of people to meet hands to

861
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,860
shake and hugs to give in names to try

862
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,359
to [ __ ] remember but it feels so good

863
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:05,729
that's I don't know that's just all the

864
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,289
social recharge that a person needs just

865
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,450
to feel good about themselves so that's

866
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:11,339
a big ego boost and a big if I were like

867
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,480
a sim video game my social meter would

868
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:14,279
just be filled up for the next [ __ ]

869

872
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:23,099
before I've shared with other vendors

873

874

876
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:33,000

887
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,040
all just dropped into pro rhythm in the

888
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,960
gym went pretty well

889
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,250
Clint's not super well versed and seed

890
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,058
so he was doing well at pitching the

891
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,799
podcast

892
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:00,089
mike is pretty well-versed at seeds and

893
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,589
has been a budtender so he's doing

894
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:03,178
pretty good with strain recommendations

895
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:05,009
you guys were finding your niches and

896
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,610
doing a good job helper monkey over here

897
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,980

898
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:10,750
grow people wanted vertical grow advice

899
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,620

900
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,690

909
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:29,949
wanna get too much weight on him but he

910
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,970
kind of does it on a bigger scale than

911
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,798
what I'm doing right now

912
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,798

opportunities one of my other favorite

919
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,190
things that happened this year at the

920
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,630
endo Expo so I was kind of segue into

921

00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,200
I bought the team and the crew and it

925
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,870
wasn't me joining somebody else like the

926
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,380
little dog in this industry in this

927
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:07,298
community there is people try to act

928
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,190
like there's a hierarchy and people are

929
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:11,259
better than people that's just how every

930
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,480
industry is every business goes that way

931
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:15,069
every click every community this year

932
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,380
some of the people that have had their

933
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,789
noses up - I read genetics they [ __ ]

934
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,559
put their heads down and looked me in

935
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,629
the eye and nodded their heads and they

936
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,668
finally like they realize we're [ __ ]

937
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,110
here Clint kept saying it is a kind of a

938
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,210
funny joke by the end of the day Sunday

939
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,649
we were tired and high and exhausted and

940
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,298
by the end of Sunday Clint's pitch was

941
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,400
or ivory genetics and we're not [ __ ]

942
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:35,289
around but that's not a joke you guys

943
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,790
people finally realized we were here or

944
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,589

946
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,250
event when people went oh [ __ ] we can't

948
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,849

949
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,890
so we're there now we got on the team

950

they let us in this time bro was it at

951
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,820
the big boys table I would literally

952
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,860
watch people circling because you had so

953
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,689
many people wanting to take selfies with

954
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:57,639
you and just meet you that they would

955
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,590
circle around and you'd see them come

956
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,210
back ten minutes later like okay just

957
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:02,829
finally free let me go talk to him and

958
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,090
you see them light up it was great

959
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:05,740
feeling man let's [ __ ] funny I don't

960
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:08,048
I don't get to see that cuz I I don't

961
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,460
get to look past like two people and I

962
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:10,779
see the guy I'm talking to and I kind of

963
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,190
make eye contact with the guy behind him

964
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,539
and nod like you're gonna be next bro

965
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,750
like I let them know that I acknowledge

966
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:18,279
them and I just right to focus so that's

967
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,470
that's [ __ ] great to know that people

968
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,710
are looping around and coming back and

969
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,809
enthusiastic yeah and you know even a

970
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,819
