hang out with rosta Jeff for some reason

125

[ __ ] yeah uh the owners of the spot said

126
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,639
that he could come smoke with me but he

127
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,319
probably would not make it to his show

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
so he opted to not smoke with me he was

129
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,399
like you look like you might murder me

130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,199
with some smoke so yeah he didn't want

131
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:35,000
to do that yeah well then you're also

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,680
yeah at a dispensary and unfortunately

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
not allowed to smoke at a dispensary

134
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,680

334
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,838
Instagram page but like Jesse said I

335
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,078
don't Instagram a lot because it's a

336
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,760
podcast I can take pictures of Jesse and

337
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,519
me and I can post them up other than

338
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,159
that um not a lot to post all right so

339
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
we're going to talk more about I want to

340
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,759
make sure I covered all the intro stuff

341
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,159
I did it's a good place to leave

342
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,838
questions though I'll say that much I

343
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,879
look at every every now and then make

344
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,760
sure there's no uh you know on the

345
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,360
Instagram yeah yeah oh yeah I try so

346
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,519
hard to answer all of the questions I

347
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,480
get since they shut down Facebook shut

348
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,078
down the iry genetics Facebook page and

349
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
took it from an interactive page and

350
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,039
made it to just a business page which I

351
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,120
find boring so I've gotten a lot of

352
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,599
spare time to check in stagram and stuff

353
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,078
like that lately I don't really mess

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,839
around that much on those Facebooks I do

355
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,078
check them to answer your questions but

356
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,240
I don't really play there like I used to

357
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:09,638
they kind of pissed me off taking my

358
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
page down like that without even talking

359
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,919
to me yeah

360
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,680
dicks all right so we've been doing grow

361
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,278
lessons teaching you guys or trying to

362
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,838
sort of Stoner style teach you guys how

363
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,600
to set up a grow room for yourself so

364
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,480
that you can be self-sufficient we've

365
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,040
gotten the room built we talked about

366
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,120
the best places to do it uh we gave you

367
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,719
a good guide so far we've got a room

368
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,799
built with lights hanging but we haven't

369
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,160
hung our ballasts yet and our timers so

370
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,559
that's kind of where we are um if you

371
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,439
guys need to catch up I'll take a pause

372
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,719
and you can go listen to the two

373
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,000
episodes before this and you can catch

374
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
up to where we are pausing all right

375
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,720
we're back now I hope you listen to

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
those and learned a whole [ __ ] ton we

377
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,839
didn't really pause that long I should

378
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,389
have pause longer cuz I need a

379
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,160
drink there's another

380
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:56,439
[Laughter]

381
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,639
chance oh editing is fun I I don't even

382
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,399
edit these shows anymore I just put them

383
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,519
out the way they go I like I like the

384
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,159
it's way better when we're just High

385
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,560
doing our thing all right so we've got

386
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,399
these big uh this big 10x 8 by8 yeah we

387
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,958
built an 8 by8 room you've got your poly

388
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,320
wrapped around everything it's all

389
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,799
sealed up you got your lights hanging um

390
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,360
now what I would like to do is show you

391
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,359
the not show you tell you the way I hang

392
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,759
my ballasts and my electronics and Jesse

393
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,278
and I have a lot of different ideas so

394
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,958
this will get fun uh I use a piece of

395
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,078
plywood to mount all of the electronics

396
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,479
in one area at Lowe's or whatever

397
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,958
hardware store they actually sell a

398
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,159
pre-cut board I think it's 24 it may be

399
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:35,239
18 in by 36 in uh and you can screw that

400
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,879
right on the wall and you can hang I can

401
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,480
fit four I can fit five ballast and my

402
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,439
power box on that and so all the ball

403
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,278
are plugged in to the power box and it's

404
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,560
also screwed to the board I screwed the

405
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,958
board to the framing on the outside of

406
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,359
the grow room to keep the heat down uh

407
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,239
Jesse was talking about if you put it on

408
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,560
the inside keep it close to the door the

409
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,919
outside is ideal because if something

410
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
goes wrong you don't have to go in there

411
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,439
to turn everything off yeah um also keep

412
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,278
a fire extinguisher near that box that's

413
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
something that I recommend um you don't

414
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,120
want to have to run into the grow room

415
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,439
if keep a smoke alarm in there if there

416
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
is a fire you don't want to have to go

417
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,320
halfway through the room to get to your

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,078
fire extinguisher you want to have it

419
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,600
outside kick the door open and start

420
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,159
spraying and put out fire that's your

421
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,879
that's your biggest fear but we you got

422
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,360
to be prepared for that so you got this

423
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,720
board you got four ballasts you've got I

424
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,680
put a power box on there cuz that's how

425
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,879
I plug everything in uh screw to the

426
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,159
wall safest way to do it too yeah I like

427
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,838
those power boxes they're really

428
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,799
reliable uh they don't pay me to say

429
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,680
that i' buy them straight America made

430
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,000
in America yes I was going to ask you

431
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,958
here's a random side note what ballasts

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,480
are made in America do you

433
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,198
know I can find out you can Google that

434
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,120
while I read on for a second I can just

435
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,559
yeah it's almost time for me to buy

436
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,720
several more ballasts and I would like

437
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,799
to buy americanmade products because uh

438
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,160
I noticed that the um what the hell

439
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,958
brand is that the quantums that used to

440
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,559
be made in Germany uhhuh now they come

441
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,439
with a made in China or a made in koreaa

442
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,919
sticker on them and they smell funny now

443
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
and also I've noticed that the fans

444
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,159
don't last as long they start [ __ ]

445
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,680
out really quickly now so I don't want

446
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,639
to buy those anymore those used to be my

447
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,919

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,759
product I've got I've got enough

484
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,159
breeding space to breed plenty of seeds

485
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,278
but when they go on sale at Nature's

486
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,480
green remedies they sell out in like 48

487
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,480
Hours yeah I've noticed uh so our good

488
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,519
buddy Jesse has stepped up to the plate

489

will be available through the iy

499
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,560

500
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:57,559
some Kim dog stuff coming and some uh

501
00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:01,638
OG uh flavorful stuff coming I like the

502
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:04,078
teas yeah I like the teas um I just hit

503
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,880
on Halloween I put Grateful Dog pollen

504
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,959
on a platinum OG female and on a sour

505
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,600
diesel female and I've never pollinated

506
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
those with the Grateful Dog before so

507
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,519
we'll have Platinum dog and sour dog

508
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,879
nice I got that same sour you have so

509
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,959
nice that's a great I was thinking about

510
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,480
throwing that up or you know dusting him

511
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,480
up a little too so Cu uh that's a great

512
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,240
strain it's stanky it just doesn't grow

513
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,519
with the Vigor that I want I want a

514
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,000
hardier thicker plant top it top the

515
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,119
[ __ ] out that thing that's what you got

516
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,679
to do it's got good yield for a plant

517
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,239
that normally exhibits that trait though

518
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,679
so and flower her early because man that

519
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,599
thing Tak off dude I learned the hard

520
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,080
way it doesn't keep up with Gorilla Glue

521
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,038
my Gorilla Glue has tripled in size

522
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,159
since I started flowering yeah nice did

523
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,558
you find me in americanmade ballast um

524
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,160
no I'm not finding uh I don't suspect uh

525
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:55,960
the galaxies are um I know some that a

526
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,240
lot of their uh uh products are made in

527
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,840
America but um

528
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,120
yeah I don't know we'll keep going we'll

529
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,918
if you guys have an idea of a good

530
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,119
americanmade ballast let me know CU it's

531
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,679
for me I'm shopping I need a lot of them

532
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,959
oh man you know what actually I think I

533
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,640
know of one it's a really expensive one

534
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,279
they the gavas or the no those would be

535
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,360
made in Holland um yeah that's what I

536
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,038
thought what's the gav's competitor the

537
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,639
eaps eaps I believe those are China

538
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,798
China so are the nanolux D I know those

539
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,799
are made in China are Lush lights made

540
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,119
in America I wonder if Lush lights are

541
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:33,440
made in America or if they're made in

542
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,759
China um I would suspect they're made I

543
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,679
for I'd really hope they are yeah well

544
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,839
oh uh solist Tech made in California

545
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,559
okay yeah really good stuff something to

546
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,000
check out guys reced by the Cotton Mouth

547
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,599
Kings

548
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,519
[Music]

549
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,439
even I thought that was one of the

550
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,319
weirdest endorsements I ever saw in my

551
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,120
life we recommend these ballasts

552
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,240
shouldn't a breeder or somebody endorse

553
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,479
that [ __ ] um I suspect that maybe the uh

554
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,679
hoarder luux makes ballast I think maybe

555
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,240
they stuff's made in America okay um I

556
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,320
want to buy americanmade ballast guys I

557
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,519
encourage you to also so I take this

558
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,319
board that I bought at Lowe's and I put

559
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,679
the board on the floor and I mount my b

560
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,879
i i don't screw it to the floor I set it

561
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,360
on the floor so I can work let me be

562
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,320
clear about that I set the board on the

563
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,158
floor and then I screw the ballasts to

564
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,038
the to the board and then I screw my

565
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,400
power box to the board and now this

566
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,960
board is movable you can hang your

567
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,919
ballast damn near anywhere you want bolt

568
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,159
that to where is convenient for you if

569
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,159
it's the outside of the room is what I

570
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,720
would prefer cuz then you're keeping

571
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,159
heat out those get yeah do it outside of

572
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,798
the room and then then you can mess with

573
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,080
your timers and stuff and not be in the

574
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,200
room so that it's just easier so bolt

575
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,319
that wherever you need screw that

576
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,038
wherever you need to the framing then

577
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,678
run that wiring through a small hole in

578
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,679
the poly and tape over it to keep the

579
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,919
light from leaking so now you've got air

580
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,480
in air out lights and power you're

581
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,720
probably going to need to cool down the

582
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,519
room um an air conditioner is definitely

583
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,880
what you're going to need you may need a

584
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,400
dehumidifier uh so take another small

585
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,240
board and put um your air conditioner

586
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,840
thermostat on there if you have one that

587
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,400
doesn't attach to the air conditioner um

588
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,678
you can plug your air conditioner into a

589
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,320
temperature sensor and hang that on the

590
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,280
wall mhm and then when the temperature

591
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,558
gets to a certain thing to the certain

592
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,599
temperature during the you can set the

593
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,519
day and night temperature and then that

594
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,599
little meter will tell the air

595
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,960
conditioner when to come on and when to

596
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,000
go off and you can do that with almost

597
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,360
any piece of equipment in your room uh

598
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,919
you can automate your um your

599
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,798
dehumidifier your air conditioner you

600
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,840
can automate your fans um and one room

601
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,359
I've got a emergency shutdown switch if

602
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,439
it hits over 95° in that room everything

603
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,519
turns off everything even the air

604
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
conditioners because I don't know what's

605
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,558
causing the problem so everything just

606
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
shuts off and the ambient temps are only

607
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,480
going to be 70 something in that area

608
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,519
anyway with there's no when there's no

609
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
light so I aam automation put all your

610
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,558
automation stuff on one board and put

611
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,640
that where it's visible uh put a

612
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:52,918
thermometer a hygrometer on there all

613
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,000
the stuff that you want to be able to

614
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,440
see sometimes that has to be inside the

615
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,240
room so put that in the room if you have

616
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,480
to if you can get the it's if you want

617
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
that out side of the room it'll be more

618
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,480
expensive trust me but that one will

619
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,038
probably have to go in the room so just

620
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,759
put all your stuff onto one board and

621
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,919
nail it to one spot up high where you

622
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,000
can see it a random side note uh when

623
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,679
you're building a grow room and you're

624
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,119
thinking about planning a grow room

625
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,240
think of water goes low electrical goes

626
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,798
High uh you want your water low on the

627
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,480
ground if you have a bucket if you got a

628
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,798
reservoir there's no need to lift that

629
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
up off the ground too high keep it low

630
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,440
uh because if it does topple over you

631
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,159
don't want it to spill on your

632
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,120
electronics which should be kept above

633
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,360
waist high yeah uh I don't run conduit

634
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,599
along the wall lower than about 36 in

635
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,918
that's my waist I actually believe that

636
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,119
code

637
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,759
um yeah pretty sure okay yeah well that

638
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,319
makes sense but these guys aren't

639
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,158
they're just building a room so we got

640
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,278
to keep water low electricity High

641
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,278
because you don't want to pour water

642
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,319
into your electricity ever uh keep your

643
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:52,880
cords organized you guys I've seen so

644
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,639
many messes of Grow rooms keep him as

645
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,840
short as possible yeah yeah I'm going

646
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,520
turn this back sorry Co no worries it

647
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,720
kind of tipped it got impotent on us

648
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,440
um and put a smoke alarm and fire

649
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,640
detector where you can get to them the

650
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,798
smoke alarm in the room the fire

651
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,120
detector outside of the room those are

652
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,079
little side notes that I wrote yeah uh

653
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,119
so you're going to need air conditioning

654
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,158
is what I wrote down next uh I follow

655
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,678
the general rule of 3,000 BTUs of air

656
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,520
conditioning per th000 watt light uh if

657
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,080
you want to use those uh traditional ACS

658
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,400
you can put in the window you can cut a

659
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,639
that do go in a window you can cut a

660
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,480
hole in the poly and mount the AC to the

661
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,960
framing but that's going to heat up

662
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,720
whatever room you dumped the AC exhaust

663
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,840
into if you're in a garage or an unused

664
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,798
basement that's cool uh but you can't

665
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,240
heat up like if you're you have to

666
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:36,480
exhaust that heat up it's got to go

667
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
somewhere or it's just going to continue

668
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,159
to heat up yeah you can run it a lot of

669
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,359
people run it straight through the

670
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,159
chimney if you got one I've seen it go

671
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,319
into the attic if you need to if you

672
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,679
guys are in illegal States you're going

673
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,759
to have to plan this a little better cuz

674
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,519
your heat signature is what they're

675
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,919
going to look for to bust you I think um

676
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,400
I've heard they have to have a warrant

677
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,159
for that but I'm no lawyer right well

678
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,440
and it's also uh 2014 almost 15 where

679
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,640
the can do just about whatever the this

680
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,360
is true too we are living in a police

681
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,120
state yeah they'll just fly over with

682
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,558
that camera they'll say oh look all that

683
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,000
bright light and then they'll just send

684
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:10,440
a car to go sit in front of your house

685
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,720
and then they'll notice some [ __ ] you

686
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,600
know that's the cops are the worst gang

687
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,919
that we have nowadays the worst

688
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,839
criminals on the D streets on the air

689
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,120
conditioners if it's going to outside a

690
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,278
lot of them or if the air conditioner is

691
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:27,079
in your room and it's in an outside

692
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:29,440
window um light shines through yes you

693
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,278
can take a uh

694
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,720
uh can of spray paint get you

695
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,000
um I can't remember how I did it but

696
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,558
there's some way you can get a nozzle on

697
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,480
there um that you can stick a little

698
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:46,158
straw in uh like WD40 I was going to say

699
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,720
the WD40 straw yeah perfectly um and

700
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,000
spray the white foam inside the vents

701
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,079
with black spray paint and it's all

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,640
clean and everything stop your refle it

703
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,038
stops the light from coming out good

704
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,720
idea good idea and if you're putting

705
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,400
that in the uh I picked that up from

706
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,600
subcool

707
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,240
actually shout out to subcool uh did you

708
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,678

a really sweet picture to Instagram the

710
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,000
other day and subcool actually sent me a

711
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,639
message that said we should collab so in

712
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,640
the future there could be some uh TGA iy

713
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,720
genetic stuff happening but uh right now

714
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,520
I'm going to focus on what I'm doing

715
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
with Jesse because I know that's for

716
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,200
real and I know I can trust Jesse I

717
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,919
don't know anybody else out there um

718
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,399
what else uh that I'm really honored for

719
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,240
that too um oh dude you're like the

720
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,599
first person I thought of for sure yeah

721
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,599
for sure um [ __ ] I had something else I

722
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,558
wanted to say before we got sidetracked

723
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,439
uh the black spray paint on the um air

724
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:47,558
conditioner um keeping light out yeah

725
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,000
[ __ ] keep going okay uh I like to use

726
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:50,319
the and they're they take more energy

727
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,159
but I like those air conditioners on

728
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,759
Wheels uh they have a little duct you

729
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,039
can just ducted it right out of a 6-in

730
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,879
duct it works perfect uh those are

731
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,919
glorious they take a little more air a

732
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,840
little more electricity yeah but they're

733
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,759
awesome also you need maybe a fan speed

734
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,558
controller if you're oh yeah for sure

735
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,240
those are always helpful just there's

736
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:09,519
always a reason to add a fan speed

737
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,359
controller I bought a uh little

738
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,000
thermostat thing to turn off my air cool

739
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,278
fans when it uh gets too cold outside

740
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,880
yeah that's I walked out to the room the

741
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,960
other day and there's 4,000 watt lights

742
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:29,039
burning um and uh normally you know it's

743
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:31,399
72 68° in there and uh it was like 55 de

744
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,720
yeah I shut all the fans off everything

745
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:36,479
and it took most of the light cycle to

746
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,200
heat back up wow yeah so I'm loving this

747
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,720
wi uh it was -6° here the other night

748
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,519
where we live very [ __ ] cold that is

749
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,278
cold yeah uh my my my air conditioners

750
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,960
aren't on in any of my grows right now

751
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,679
and I'm confident that that's okay I've

752
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,399
turned all of the air conditioners off

753
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,080
just let that I'm saving some

754
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,798
electricity right now a lot of

755
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,839
electricity yeah yeah we heat with wood

756
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,759
um in yeah I've I've gone through an

757
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,720
insane amount of firewood in the last

758
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,759
three days wow yeah

759
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,519
that's probably 3 400 lb [ __ ] I don't

760
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,720
even know you build your rooms to where

761
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,000
there you build your grows to where

762
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,079
there are a lot of work I'm that guy

763
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,798
that automates as much as I can so that

764
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:20,639
I do not I'm just talking about my house

765
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,759
oh just the house holy [ __ ] okay man I I

766
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,240
don't automate any of my waterings I

767
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,480
feel that I need to be in there watering

768
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,599
the plants by hand myself that's when I

769
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,480
touch them I move every pot when water I

770
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,119
touch every plant I look at I'll pull

771
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,278
off a leaf off of almost every plant and

772
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,918
look at the bottom look for a bug like

773
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm anal in the room I've got like a

774
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,480
ritual that I go through in there every

775
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,080
day you know like no you can't bug me

776
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,839
until this is done or everything will go

777
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,599
wrong I have to love this room but I

778
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,038
automate almost everything else I can of

779
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,278
course your light cycles your air

780
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,319
conditioning your dehumidifier your CO2

781
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,720
all that stuff and the new rules that

782
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,158
they're trying to propose here in PUO

783
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,600
Colorado they want to ban CO2 augment

784
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,159
what yeah that's one of the stupid

785
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,398
things they wrote in the rules so we'll

786
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,480
talk about that more in the future but

787
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:09,918
that just came in my head yeah p p right

788
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,519
right clown shoes yeah clown shoes guys

789
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:17,759
size 55 Triple

790
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:19,000
E yes um so yeah you got your I hope

791
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,879
that made sense we just mounted the

792
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ballast right to a board then we put the

793
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,159
board right up on the wall and then you

794
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,398
got to run all the cables that's the

795
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,679
part I skipped make sure when you push

796
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,599
the cables together make sure you push

797
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,320
them tight all the way all the way tight

798
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,000
because when that shit's loose that's

799
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,839
electricity that's live right there just

800
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,798
being exposed I want a design I I've

801
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,439
made them myself I just bend them all up

802
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,038
but out of wire but I do a safety wire

803
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,960
too to hold it all together uh when I

804
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,599
was in bands I learned to tie cords that

805
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,880
are connected together in that knot to

806
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,639
where if you pull instead it tightens

807
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,640
the knot instead of them coming apart I

808
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,360
like that move a lot I used to be a roie

809
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,480
and a

810
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:57,038
musician back in the 70s man um the I

811
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,079
talked about a tip on pictures and since

812
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,440
we're talking about running cords here

813
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:04,678
it is um the cord that runs from the

814
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,200
ballast to the light is what causes all

815
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:11,360
the bars in your picture so the shorter

816
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,159
those are and the um neater they're hung

817
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,158
and everything the less bars and [ __ ]

818
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,080
you'll have coming up on your you know

819
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,360
on some cameras yeah cuz it's the

820
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,918
magnetics that causes that yeah okay and

821
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,000
I think I that's a good tip I didn't

822
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,519
know that I can't remember I haven't uh

823
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,038
I didn't really care about it when I set

824
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,359
up my new room but um I think if you

825
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:36,319
keep all the chords away from each other

826
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,519
too you know individually instead of so

827
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,720
they don't TI together on the ceiling

828
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,440
Yeah well yeah that makes sense because

829
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,880
way more of that signal all at once that

830
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,159
would make

831
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,399
sense I wrote down so much stuff on so

832
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,720
many different papers I'm looking for

833
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:50,798
them

834
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
all too many different things on too

835
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,879
many papers looks way professional I'm

836
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,398
trying dude I'm trying [ __ ] looks like

837
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,799
Howard Stern or no hey now

838
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:02,678
can I get sued for that that's like his

839
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,879
[ __ ] trademark huh screw that guys

840
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,399
sorry Howard I didn't mean to steal your

841
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,600
trademark that was uh that was flattery

842
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,719
is what that was um all right so we've

843
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,038
got this room mostly figured out uh we

844
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
got lights hung we've got all of our

845
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:15,759
automation set up hopefully uh we got

846
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,599
air going in we got air going out we've

847
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,839
got an air conditioner now that you got

848
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,719
most of everything set up you got your

849
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:26,439
pond liner on the floor uh I would add

850
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,120
four 4x4 tables um I use and I don't

851
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,320
want to say Brands but I use the hydro

852
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:32,158
Farm 4x4 White Flood tables cuz they're

853
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,119
perfect yeah those are perfect I like to

854
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,519
raise them up off the ground uh I like

855
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,199
the white Botanicare trays you can find

856
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,440
someone to make you a stand for them or

857
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,319
you can put them on buckets those those

858
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,840
tables that they sell are so damn

859
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,480
expensive don't buy the tables that are

860
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,720
preab unless you're looking to look like

861
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,038
you got a pro room um and just straight

862
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,558
up Hydro Store guy here most of those

863
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,919
tables are

864
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,798
[ __ ] so the big foot table one over

865
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,240
yeah I was going to say the Bigfoot

866
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,639
table is just stuck together with little

867
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,120
plastic pegs it can fall over so easily

868
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,038
they're ridiculous yeah uh the reason I

869
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,719
like the tables and the trays I like to

870
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,278
get the plants up off the ground uh the

871
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,679
floor gets too cold when you lift them

872
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,079
up off the ground that you get a more

873
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,880
regulated temperature I feel like you

874
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,839
can get a little more air flow and I'm

875
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,840
6'5 dude haven't plants done on the

876
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,398
ground I have to get on my knee to get

877
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,599
down to the soil to see what's happening

878
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,278
at the soil level or the bottom foliage

879
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,959
lifting them up off the ground 2 feet

880
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,278
now they're in my face they're right

881
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,480
where I want them and I don't have to

882
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:31,278
squat all day um I like that better too

883
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,440
um you get to see a lot more what's

884
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,398
going on too it's just I feel you know

885
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,679
you notice way more for sure and this is

886
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:38,959
that that's kind of it depends on how

887
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,360
much space you have and how big a plant

888
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,440
you want to grow if you're growing seven

889
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,119
gallon pots and you're putting them on a

890
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,600
table now you're going to have a 7 foot

891
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,359
tall plant maybe by the end so you got

892
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,000
to plan ahead uh but the 4x4 tables you

893
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,079
can fit four seven gallon pots or 9 or

894
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,119
12 three gallon pots you can they're

895
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:56,439
perfect for one light worth of stuff uh

896
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,398
if you're in a legal State and you got

897
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,159
the numbers and you're going to do Hydro

898
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,719
you can do 64 those little 6in rock wool

899
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,320
cubes and just put a clone in there and

900
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,120
veg them for like a week and flow in

901
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,158
there dude I've seen people pull a pound

902
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,518
and a half off of 64 little clones veg

903
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,320
for a week and a half on a table like

904
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,919
that 64 little nugs yep that's all it

905
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,278

967
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,679
totally off topic guys but have fun with

968
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,440
us uh they were seating us for The Joe

969
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,399
Rogan Experience or the recording of his

970
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,120
live show and then were cam is all over

971
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,038
Comedy Works and they put me and my crew

972
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,239
there was me and my date and one of our

973
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,119
good friends and we all had dreadlocks

974
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,079
and they put us in about row eight where

975
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,518
no one can see us and so we're like yeah

976
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,079
I get it but then they would bring in

977
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,880
normal looking people and set them in

978
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,158
rows three and four but then if a guy

979
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,760
came in with a good-looking girl like

980
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,278
there was a girl that came in and I'm

981
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,599
not even being a dick she had her

982
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,558
boobies hanging out she was wearing like

983
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,278
a peach colored shirt she was all tan

984
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,558
and had her hair all done and I looked

985
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:58,599
at my date and I go front row watch and

986
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,960
they got two people out of the front row

987
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:02,079
they're like you guys have to move and

988
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,000
they put her in her date front row in

989
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,319
the middle yeah it was just funny and

990
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,319
they were just doing it for TV it was

991
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,239
just Prett people up front they put me

992
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,398
under a camera so that there was no

993
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,959
chance of that camera getting me it was

994
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,000
but it was cool because I was the camera

995
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,440
that job was looking directly into the

996
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,280
whole recording there was a camera like

997
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,159
about 20 rows back from the stage they

998
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,800
only did about half the comedy club full

999
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,240
that night it was awesome but yeah I'm

1000
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,119
way ranting but I had so much fun seeing

1001
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,638
Joe R it was stressful being a taping

1002
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,760
the rules they all they ask you for your

1003
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,200
phone like Comedy Works wants to take

1004
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,240
your phone from you so that it doesn't

1005
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,838
ring or go off during the taping oh

1006
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,519
Jesus they wanted they wouldn't let you

1007
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,320
wear a hat they wanted me to cover up my

1008
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,079
iy genetics logo on my shirt but I

1009
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,679
didn't do it yeah they did not want

1010
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,720
logos they definitely put the three

1011
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,679
dreadlocked tippies out of camera sight

1012
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,918

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,559

1045
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:58,039
Pike Speak oh easily yeah yeah all right

1048
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,598

1049

1050
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,000
in the snow before oh yeah no you guys

1051
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,760
are in Colorado you've done this was

1052
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,079
just a year ago not even that all right

1053
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,640
guys we're going to get back on building

1054
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,359
a grow room we're kind of ranting here

1055
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,879
we've had some dabs I hope you're taking

1056
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:20,480
dabs so uh if you're building a hydro

1057
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,640
Hut that's very similar to this setup

1058
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,838
I'd run the ducting for the lights uh

1059
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,559
there's a couple way to do the lights

1060
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,159
but I would run the lights the ducting

1061
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,559
straight through the Hut so that the

1062
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,279
light Heat never makes it into the Hut

1063
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,039
there's a hole on the left side and the

1064
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,560
right side of the Huts at the top uh

1065
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,079
hang the blower inside the hut on one

1066
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,480
side run the ducting from the

1067
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,160
outside um over the blower over the

1068
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,960
light and out of the other side um yeah

1069
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,000
that way the heat that makes sense you

1070
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,679
just make a tunnel right through it and

1071
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,800
the heat never actually stays inside the

1072
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,078
grow Hut yeah uh there's also a little

1073
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,599
hole in the roof of the Huts I had a

1074
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,880
blower there I said roof just the roof

1075
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,119
that's all the top had over there uh to

1076
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,960
pull fresh air through the Hut

1077
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,480
constantly I put a carbon filter and a

1078
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,519
blower inside the hut and F it out of

1079
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,318
the top there it makes the air flow pull

1080
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,679
air in from the bottom and the heat goes

1081
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:07,920
out the top uh and always remember

1082
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,639
always remember that your blower can

1083
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,159
pull more air than can push then it can

1084
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,799
push I wrote down a lot of shitty half

1085
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,118
ass notes right there none of those

1086
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,519
notes were full sentences blowers work

1087
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,358
better when they're outside of the room

1088
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,559
it's the same reason you never see the

1089
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,559
fart fan in the bathroom it's always

1090
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,639
mounted up in the ceiling it's easier to

1091
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,440
pull air out than it is to push it out

1092
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,039
definitely easier to pull um um here's a

1093
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,480
question for you uh do you run a carbon

1094
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,838
filter in ense when you're collect

1095
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,519
collecting pollen you know I've I don't

1096
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,119
because I don't have a blower at all in

1097
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,679
my tent where I'm collecting pollen I

1098
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,559
run um when God you're dude this is

1099
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,440
crazy secret [ __ ] right there I've got a

1100
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,679
male that's in full flour right now get

1101
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,838
ready to do it it's a genuine quit so

1102
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:54,679
I've got him in his own 3x3 Hut with one

1103
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,318
coily CFL in there to keep him awake and

1104
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,118
that's all because I can't create any

1105
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,079
heat cuz I don't want to suck the out

1106
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,519
gotta yeah so he's just in there with

1107
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,880
the CFL you can take a peek when we're

1108
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,960
done if you

1109
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,519
want maybe you don't want to there's

1110
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,880
pollen in there yeah you'll need a

1111
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,039
shower um I've always wondered about I'm

1112

that out to a different light if uh

1116

it right over the top Cola and secure it

1120
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,960
and then um when I'm sure that I see him

1121
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,358
when he's nutting a whole bunch I just

1122
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,159
cut that sucker off yeah and then I have

1123
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:37,719
the branch sticking out of the bag and

1124
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,358
I'll hold it with my hand around the

1125
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,199
branch and pull the branch out of the

1126
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,799
bag slowly and as you pull you knock

1127
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,519
everything off into the bag and you just

1128
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
come out with a stick and then you just

1129
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,838
clean up the yeah and then I'll clean

1130
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,639
out all that get the wet material out of

1131
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,480
there pour that onto a I use a drum head

1132
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,239
actually an old drum head flip it upside

1133
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,838
down and pour all my [ __ ] under there

1134
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,959
buch of separate yeah I had a that's how

1135
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,920
I got the idea I like I'm going to

1136
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,880
repurpose that [ __ ] but nice uh so if

1137
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,838
you leave those in the Hut with that bag

1138
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,358
over there with the blower on the top it

1139
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:06,078
doesn't steal a lot of your pollen but

1140
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:07,799
it does take some a little bit but

1141
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,920
you're going to make enough well see I'm

1142
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,280
also fenal hunting too I'm not just

1143
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,960
collecting yeah and I already know that

1144
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
male is who I want so I'm just let him

1145
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,838

time yeah yeah this male this is his uh

1150
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,760
the same male probably his 10th time

1151
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,279
pollinating [ __ ] a clone of the same

1152
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,520
male not the same guy but a clone of

1153
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,640
that one this his 10th time hitting

1154

stuff at least shoot my one male that uh

1155

already have picked out proven himself

1156
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,160
and everything um that's I took clones

1157
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,920
of them the other day and I took like 25

1158
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,480
nice uh just to make sure I will only

1159

you got to have one yeah so yeah I'm

1161
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,838
excited that all the Clones I recently

1162
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,759
took uh they all cut or they all rooted

1163
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,920
um most of the seeds I've sprouted are

1164
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,040
all germinating um man I'm working on

1165
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,880
another project I am I don't know if I

1166
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,960
even want to tell everybody this I am

1167
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,280
starting to F2 black cherry Kim I'm

1168
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,838
doing the feno hunt to find the male and

1169
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,359
the female to F2 that I plan to start

1170
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:16,199
the flowering cycle right at the start

1171
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,239
of the year so by March 1ish I should

1172
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,639
have found a good male and a good female

1173
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,719
that will be used the Clones of those

1174
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,318
will be ran next to be bred to make and

1175
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,959
I'll use two females and one male I'll

1176
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:29,400
use a purple female and a non-purple

1177
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,639
female and see what the progy make

1178
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,559
definitely a solid purple male I just

1179
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,559
want to see if I cuz I may uh may make

1180
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,679
it recessive if I force too much purple

1181
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,440
into it may not come out till the F3 if

1182
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,559
I do that with the two purples mhm yeah

1183
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,960
I hope you guys are paying attention to

1184
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,759
that that's random [ __ ] right there also

1185
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,519
another way that I've been setting up

1186
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,760
these tents um with just one blower

1187
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,599
because it seemed it seems efficient uh

1188
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,200
if you're in a small space I put the 5x5

1189
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:01,000
Hut with uh I do the blower on the roof

1190
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,399
outside of the Hut it's actually sitting

1191
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,280
there's that hole right on top I just

1192
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,480
set the blower right on top of there I

1193
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,800
run ducting into the Hut and then around

1194
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,400
into the light uh fix the light

1195
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,440
reflector and then ducting out of the

1196
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,280
light reflector to a carbon filter and

1197
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,440
the carbon filter is hung really high in

1198
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,160
the Hut as high as you can get it so now

1199
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,720
you're filtering the air pulling out

1200
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,960
humidity and cooling your light all at

1201
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,838
one time yep and those work great in the

1202
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,039
garage right now in Colorado in the

1203
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,519
winter you need a heater more than you

1204
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,318
need cool you got to put a heater in

1205
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,440
there at night to keep it warm but if

1206
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:35,318
you've got two of those Huts you could

1207
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
run them side by side and you could vent

1208
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:38,400
that heat into the other Hut from your

1209
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,639
light if you thought about how to do it

1210
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,800
and CO2 yeah which is soon to be illegal

1211
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,039
yeah uh sleeping plants emit CO2 so if

1212
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,760
you move your dark the air from your

1213
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,800
sleeping room into your awake room you

1214
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,680
are moving CO2 to a usable space that's

1215
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,960
a that's a definite good hint for people

1216
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,078
I wonder if uh mushroom bags are on that

1217
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
seat O2 ban sorry to keep harping on

1218
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,240
that no that uh that's a very they I

1219
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,519
think they're talking about using tanks

1220
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,239
is what they're afraid of because it's

1221
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:07,519
unsafe because we have to travel with

1222
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,279
tanks and we don't have any sort of

1223
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,119
Licensing or anything oh Jesus but my

1224
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,880
argument because I am going to go to

1225
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,039
City Council when this comes up I'm

1226
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,358
going to say this is available at the

1227
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,960
hydroponic store why can the guy growing

1228
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,838
tomatoes or the guy growing orchids or

1229
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,920
whatever else he's using why can he have

1230
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,558
CO2 and since I'm a cannabis grower I

1231
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,159
cannot I don't I drive around with a

1232
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,640
bottle of acetylene you want to talk

1233
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,639

1234
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,719
um I have no special license I went down

1235
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:37,318
to air gas and they gave it to me I

1236
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,919
signed a contract that says I wouldn't

1237
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:41,199
damage their bottle but I'm not that's

1238

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,880
first moved here winter killed me and

1277
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,679
now I don't get I'm to knock on wood I

1278
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,160
don't get sick like I used to when I

1279
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:07,318
first moved here I'd get terribly sick

1280
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,838
every winter just cuz I didn't know what

1281
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,239
to do with minus 6 have to go to school

1282
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,119
and I didn't know even what do you do

1283
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,519
how do you even dress for this you got

1284
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,599
to dress like it's Antarctica to get to

1285
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:19,480
school and then when you get to school

1286
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,920
it's 77 in the classroom so now you're

1287
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,639
sweating your ass off I had to learn how

1288
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,838
to adjust without getting sick it was

1289
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:29,358
weird I'm from Durango so I've been used

1290
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:33,199
to it oh yeah um living in PUO softing

1291
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,719
me up so this is like whoa I think these

1292
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,519
gener we were talking about this earlier

1293
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,558
these Generations are getting softer as

1294
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:40,199
we go yeah uh we were talking about a

1295
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,839
doctor our good buddy Spence had his

1296
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,679
appendix removed and Jesse was kind

1297
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,358
enough to post a meme of a doctor

1298
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,558
removing his own damn appendix on

1299
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,960
Spencer's Facebook that's pretty cute uh

1300
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,440
but this generation I don't know how

1301
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,760
many people would just reach down and

1302
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,559
remove their own appendix we're too

1303
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,720
entitled shouldn't somebody else do this

1304
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,680
yeah

1305
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,919
it's kind of where we are guys if you

1306
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,078
have more questions about a hydro Hut uh

1307
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm pretty good at them I just don't

1308
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,440
know what to say uh if you got a

1309
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,680
question I can set up your hydro Hut

1310
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,358
like a champ I can give you a lot of

1311
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:13,239
advice on that um bracing sometimes

1312
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,838
these hoods and you get a carbon filter

1313
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:18,118
and a blower and everything hung up

1314
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:22,358
there um easy ways to brace it um it's a

1315
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:25,640
good idea go buy some PVC um and just

1316
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:28,440
freaking tape it really tight or tie it

1317
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,279
um to the other roof beams that'll help

1318
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,280
give you a little yeah structure up

1319
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,680
there I've seen someone uh screw a they

1320
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,599
had a 4x4 Hut so they took a 4x4 piece

1321
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,799
of plywood and screwed it to the roof on

1322
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,599
the outside um and that really really

1323
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,200
strengthened that thing out man the dude

1324
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,720
could have stood on the top of it so

1325
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,239
nice they do they are a little rickety

1326
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,078
they're a little wobbly if you're

1327
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,679
putting like a a heavy if you don't have

1328
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,280
the right carbon filter the good carbon

1329
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,399
filters are heavy they sell lighter ones

1330
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,119
that are more expensive if you don't

1331
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,240
have that one putting a lot of weight up

1332
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,880
there uh a light is expensive if you're

1333
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:04,479
hanging like a tri XXL Raptor that's

1334
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,720
some heavy [ __ ] yeah you probably don't

1335
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,838
need one of those in a in a tent just a

1336
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:14,558
little you know T there yeah um what is

1337
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:19,039
the the 8 in uh Sun

1338
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,400
H oh uh Sun Sun Stars snow yeah I know

1339
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,519
exactly which reflectors I love and the

1340
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,720
radiant sixes oh yeah the radi six or

1341
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:25,400
the radiant eight it's about the size of

1342
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,558
a shoe box it's nice and white those are

1343
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,160
great I think instead of a big big wide

1344
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,040
reflector a little reflector is better

1345
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,679
because and you can make a sexual joke

1346
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,000
out of this if you want but I want it to

1347
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,480
go deeper I don't want it so

1348
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
wide I want my light to penetrate the

1349
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,838
canopy I was going to say you get better

1350
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,159
penetration that way yeah I want more

1351
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,519
penetration I don't need you tearing it

1352
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:49,078
apart so wide go deeper it's still I

1353
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:50,719
mean you got 1,000 watts is 1,000 Watts

1354
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,440
so if you're reflector spreading it out

1355
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:57,399
to a 5x5 area or you have a reflector

1356
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,119
spreading it out to a 3X3 area which

1357
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,680
you know reflector you gonna get a

1358
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,480
better value for that thousand Watts

1359
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:04,799
from and in my opinion it's going to be

1360
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,800
the 3X3 every time absolutely and in

1361
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,400
those Huts uh those Huts are very well

1362
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,318
made with that reflective material in

1363
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,000
there agreed I feel like I get a lot

1364
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,599
more lumens out of those Huts than I do

1365
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,280
the open rooms that I run mhm for sure

1366
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,000
they take better pictures too yeah they

1367
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,960
sure they got that sexy background in

1368
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,280
there all right so most of this is the

1369
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,880
same if you're working in a bedroom or a

1370
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,319
closet just uh on a smaller scale uh if

1371
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,920
you can't cut holes uh for ducting try

1372
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,759
using a window we kind of talked about

1373
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,519
tricking you on the Windows uh once

1374
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,599
again use some of that blue uh it's foam

1375
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,679
board I don't I think it's for

1376
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,519
insulation they got it at Lowe's uh cut

1377
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,279
that to size pop that in your window

1378
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,119
with some duct tape uh if you need to

1379
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,920
cut holes out of that I take actually I

1380
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,838
use a pre-made 6 in or 8 in flange

1381
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,920
that's used for a blower and I set that

1382
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:52,358
on that blue foam board and I just step

1383
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,680
on it that's how I cut holes in my foam

1384
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:56,318
board perfect sizes for my ducks nice

1385
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:58,159
yeah put your shoe on and step on it cuz

1386
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,199
that should cut take

1387
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,598
off yeah and then you got to you got to

1388
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,719
knock that out cuz it gets stuck in

1389
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,000
there so you got to use something to

1390
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,759
punch it out yep it's kind of fun damn

1391
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,318
that's a nice little uh uh life hack is

1392
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,119
the popular new on that or grow room

1393
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,838
hack instead of trying to cut just be

1394
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,039
lazy and stomp it out uh I always use a

1395
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:21,279
dry wall saw and make a gigantic mess

1396
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,558
everywhere oh yeah that blue when you

1397
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,319
cut that blue foam board it's going to

1398
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,079
make a gigantic foamy mess everywhere

1399
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,838
and it'll clog up your saws like nothing

1400
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,720
other oh yeah yeah and it gets real

1401
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:34,400
hot um yeah disguise your out Ducks um

1402
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,279
if you can duct it out of the attic or a

1403
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,160
chimney uh that's awesome uh you don't

1404
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,119
want your neighbors seeing it's minus 6

1405
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,440
outside right now where my heat is

1406
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,640
dumping outside I'm pretty sure it's

1407
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,039
making

1408
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:49,000
steam yeah yeah no M even if it's even

1409
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,599
if it's 20° it'll probably make Steam

1410
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,519
dumping into minus 6 so they can see

1411
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,039
your air coming out of your grow space

1412
00:48:53,519 --> 00:49:00,798
at 80° coming up the lights yeah seen

1413
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,558
that before um melting snow off the roof

1414
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:04,079
so yeah there was a guy in another

1415
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,760
neighborhood that a friend of mine and I

1416
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,920
used to make fun of cuz every morning at

1417
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,920
7:00 you could see the blower click in

1418
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,039
and the one section would clear from the

1419
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,559
snow and about 30 minutes later one side

1420
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:15,039
of the roof would be all clear like

1421
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,200
that's where his grow space is you can

1422
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,318
see it in the Attic right up there all

1423
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,759
right so you got all your automation uh

1424
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:22,400
you've got everything ducted we've got

1425
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,880
lights going we've got

1426
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,838
timers um man it's almost time to add

1427
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,880
plants I would say get everything set up

1428
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:30,440
run the room uh set all of your timers

1429
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,838
and everything run a cycle or two make

1430
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,798
sure your air conditioner kicks in when

1431
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,078
it gets too hot make sure the lights go

1432
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,440
off and on as planned uh pay attention

1433
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,480
to the temps and humidity without the

1434
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,679
plants in the room and this is the time

1435
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,760
to make Corrections if you need to also

1436
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,199
keep in mind um an empty room runs

1437
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,200
hotter than a room full of plants when

1438
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,399
plants absorb heat and energy so and it

1439
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,159
will also be less humid yeah without

1440
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,240
plants so it's going to be hotter yeah

1441
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,719
so when I put plants in the plants are

1442
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,598
going to cool it yeah yeah um do you

1443
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:03,598
have a guess if I were running this 8

1444
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,519
by8 room how many degrees my plants are

1445
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,480
going to drop it no okay I I he's

1446
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:10,039
completely right but I thought he may

1447
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,838
have done more thought on that I I've

1448
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,400
noticed it but I don't know and I also

1449
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,000
know that when I'm in there I heat the

1450
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,119
room up ridiculously yeah yeah I've

1451
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,599
noticed that too so fast um I've really

1452
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,079
noticed it mostly on ents um I'd say

1453
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,960
actually you know what I've noticed it

1454
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,720
on gigantic rooms too um it it varies um

1455
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,798
it's at least a couple degrees dirt can

1456
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:34,279
hold a [ __ ] ton of heat the dirt kind of

1457
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:36,280
yeah kind of uh then reservoirs um you

1458
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,359
know they'll hold heat too uh water

1459
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,680
reservoirs yeah yeah so that's how we

1460
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:42,679
heat greenh houses I was going to say

1461
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:43,919
I've seen you guys put big jugs of water

1462
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,919
in the Sun and then haul them into the

1463
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,358
greenhouse at night to keep them warm uh

1464
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,079
my friend Ryan actually was heating

1465
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,798
bricks in his oven he would put a big uh

1466
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,200
like a pot of bricks like he was just

1467
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,599
making a pot roast full of bricks and

1468
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,838
he'd heat those up and then go outside

1469
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,240
and cover the plants in a tarp and then

1470
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:01,119
put the hot bricks underneath the tarpu

1471
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:03,919
he just harvested like a week ago in

1472
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:08,798
Colorado nice Outdoors speaking of all

1473
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,680
these uh cold weathers um weathers god

1474
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,440
let's go down to

1475
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:16,078
Walmarts

1476
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,480
um uh my Greenhouse I harvested all the

1477
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,039
plants right before it got freezing cold

1478
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,280
in it um but uh I had a couple

1479
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,199
containers with lettuce and spinach and

1480
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,359
radish and onions um and I'm super

1481
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:30,358
stoked that uh with my little tiny

1482
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:32,639
heater and my little Greenhouse uh the

1483
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:35,199
spinach made it through so did some of

1484
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,598
the lettuce nice uh everything else is

1485
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,639
frozen [ __ ] dead but frozen

1486
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,760
vegetables already

1487
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,279
yeah all right guys we're getting 50

1488
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,599
minutes in here um yeah run your rooms

1489
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,400
that's what I'm going to say run the

1490
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,838
rooms run that bad [ __ ] run it and then

1491
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,920
once everything is cool then you can put

1492
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:51,159
plants in there and then you're going to

1493
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,318
have to make a couple of adjustments

1494
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:55,920
once you put plants in there um for sure

1495
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,480
if you're just vegging you're fine you

1496
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,559
can tweak around with your rooms while

1497
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,119
you're vegging you're not going to piss

1498
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,200
the plants off too much as soon as you

1499
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,880
start flower you have to be really

1500
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,358
really careful with your photo periods

1501
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,880
that's your light cycle we call that

1502
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:08,318
photo period we're going to start saying

1503
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,599
photo period all the time and leave out

1504
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,400
the word light cycles because photo

1505
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,440
period is appropriate and

1506
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,318
proper if you interrupt your photo

1507
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,599
period on a flowering plant uh it will

1508
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,199
possibly revert back to veg and it will

1509
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,838
probably hermaphrodite and you're

1510
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,439
running a good chance of making some

1511
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,639
seeds out of that on accident that you

1512
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,000
don't want so don't don't mess with your

1513
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:31,598
photo period keep that solid yeah leave

1514
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,400
the seeds to us no no no just kidding

1515
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,200
please do if you got a good breeding

1516
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,599
project keep it going um can't props I

1517
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,919
used to be really kind of secretive and

1518
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,960
I didn't like to share my breeding

1519
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,400
information because I feel like I'll

1520
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,960
teach you how to grow but breeding you

1521
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,318
got to get a good grasp on breed on

1522
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,240
growing and once you've got that then

1523
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,880
you'll kind of learn how to breed with

1524
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,039
that on accident yeah yeah uh but I kind

1525
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,519
of been sharing a little bit of my

1526
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,239
breeding secret so if you guys have a

1527
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:58,079
specific question I'd rather help you

1528
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,318
than just watch you fail is how I feel

1529
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,519
about it you're going to do it so why

1530
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:03,880
not help you do it right when I first

1531
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:07,599
got started I won't mention any names

1532
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,280
but I hit up a couple guys um you know

1533
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,720
it just was some basic questions and I

1534
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,079
got told to you know [ __ ] off basically

1535
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,679
so um always kind of disheartened me so

1536
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,760
yeah but it also encouraged me I was

1537
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,639
like screw these guys I can do this

1538
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,079
right uh just taking a little time to

1539
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,000
research stuff and read it on your own

1540
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:27,240
goes a long way oh yeah the internet is

1541
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,039
great but and I've been banned from so

1542
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,919
many forums and chat rooms because the

1543
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,719
internet is full of [ __ ] and people will

1544
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,760
type whatever they want without knowing

1545
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,838
what they're talking about and I feel

1546
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,280
that that sucks cuz it causes problems

1547
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,679
that's part of what inspired this show

1548
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,480
was reading [ __ ] on the internet going

1549
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,078
dude I hope nobody tried that or

1550
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,880
actually seeing somebody ask his friend

1551
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,359
a question on a forum that sounds like

1552
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,760
troll it up but it's not troll it up

1553
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:49,798
it's very similar I've been banned so I

1554
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,079
won't advertise the site but on troll it

1555
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:54,000
up somebody asked a question and the guy

1556
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,960
replied with a totally [ __ ] answer

1557
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,798
to his friend and he's like awesome man

1558
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,639
I'm going to try today and I'm like dude

1559
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:00,920
don't your friend just killed your whole

1560
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:02,719
crop however many plants you have

1561
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,920
they're dead if you do that and that's

1562
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,239
part of what inspired this I wanted to

1563
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,240
get people that know what they're doing

1564
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:10,919
to come and put a good voice out for

1565
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:13,919
cannabis there's a um a thing on the

1566
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,519
probiotics Farmers Alliance uh a pin

1567
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,519
it's the very first post if you ever

1568
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:22,719

1569
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:25,119
verbatim but by any means but um uh you

1570
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,838
know it just says essentially you know

1571
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,480
don't make something fact just because

1572
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,519
you believe or okay yeah I can't I can't

1573
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,199
really uh recreate it but yeah it's just

1574
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,960
it you know um there's so much [ __ ] out

1575
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:39,318
there and people just type [ __ ] and they

1576
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,480
believe it and they're full of [ __ ]

1577
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,920
themselves and you know just what work

1578
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,039
for them may not work for you your

1579
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,159
situation could be totally different

1580
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,639
yeah yeah I don't think I'm a member of

1581
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,000
that group anymore so I won't be able to

1582
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,318
see it yeah I had to leave that group

1583
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,519
cuz they put up too much stuff and I got

1584
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:57,039
way too many yeah I mean it's a great

1585
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,079
place but yeah yeah I'm not in the group

1586
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:04,199
so I can't view their stuff but still

1587
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:06,960
good group yeah yeah Allan Atkinson uh

1588
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,719

about 3T tall nice uh just uh Eugenics

1603
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,280

1604
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,760

plant that got some mold and uh I didn't

1613
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:01,960
notice it till we were trimming it and

1614
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,119
uh I saw it threw the freaking thing

1615
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,280
away and the guy that was helping me Tri

1616
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,200
uh I'm pretty sure he wanted to go take

1617
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,599
through the trash can yeah I just threw

1618
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,239
it in dirt I was like dude I'm not no

1619
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,440
it's just I had

1620
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:18,038
AET like your situation I had a white

1621
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,159
rhino plant that had to be 5 oz it's a s

1622
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:21,359
gallon pot uh the top Cola was as big as

1623
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,879
a football it was the size of this

1624
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,480
Gatorade bottle oh Jesus and uh it was

1625
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,960
this season of the year so there was a

1626
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,039
lot of cold in the air and I was like

1627
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,480
that plant I know it already and I kept

1628
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,839
checking it nothing kept checking it

1629
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,079
nothing at Harvest Time the center of

1630
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,480
one bud had Milo all up the middle and I

1631
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,160
threw the whole plant away because I

1632
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,318
didn't want to go fish through every bud

1633
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:40,199
and my my trimmer buddy Mike it was Mike

1634
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,838
at the time we were just kind of new

1635
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,118
friends at the time nice I just put a

1636
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,719
trash bag over it and threw it all the

1637
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,160
way and he's like the whole thing bro

1638
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,118
and I was like yeah we we can't mess

1639
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,440
with that I'm that's the difference

1640
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,039
between a pot farmer and a caregiver MH

1641
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,159
I'm growing medical weed the person that

1642
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,359
would have sold that is just growing

1643
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,480
shitty weed for me for money oh and then

1644
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,798
also I mean yeah yeah there's just so so

1645
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,159
many reasons throw it away uh I don't

1646
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:03,798
like failure so I don't want to keep a

1647
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,838
moldy plan around my house to spread

1648
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:08,719

read just to make sure I don't lie to

1675
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,119
you because I made a mistake on the show

1676
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,159
one time and I felt really stupid I

1677
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:05,358
don't want to go teaching wrong [ __ ] so

1678
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,879
definitely had to come back and correct

1679
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,239
myself so I've been making sure to read

1680
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,599
everything and stay on top I'm reading

1681
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,519
more about nutrients because I know

1682
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,838
about nutrients but you get so

1683
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,480
comfortable that you don't even pay

1684
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:15,679
attention anymore I'm like he I know

1685
