golden ticket and heritage both do

195
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,160

196
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,840
an instagram

197
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,000

catch some auctions from golden ticket

199
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,839
or heritage seeds on the instagram

200
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
uh be careful with the words you use and

201
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,399
the things you say on instagram because

202
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,439
you don't want to get their account

203
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,239
taken down

204
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,439
also if you do make a paypal payment to

205
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
somebody for seeds

206
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,959
or a venbo payment or some type of

207
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
payment where you're sending digital

208
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,399
money

209
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,839
for seeds don't put the words four seeds

210
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,959
in the paypal or in the notes or

211
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,918
whatever because a lot of those

212
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,758
companies don't like

213
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,198
seeds just be a little more careful with

214
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,639
that be a little bit more discreet i

215
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,560
know you're not on the hustler

216
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,840
side of life but let's keep the hustlers

217
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,399
safe and keep them

218
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,839
secure if you put seeds or certain

219
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,638
strain names if you put the word

220
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,799
kush or something like that in a paypal

221
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,639
payment paypal will flag that payment

222
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
it will take 30 to 90 days for that

223
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
person to receive that payment

224
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,758
if they receive that payment if paypal

225
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,519
deems that that account has been doing

226
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,038
suspicious or fraudulent activity

227
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,240
they will freeze the account they will

228
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,800
seize the assets which are in the

229
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,560
account

230
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,960
and they will use those accounts to

231
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,879
investigate your fraudulent activity

232
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,079
once they have depleted your funds and

233
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,918
investigations they forget

234
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,598
about it they cancel the claim they

235
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,719
delete your account and it's game over

236
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,199
so please you guys

237
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
if you're buying seeds from uh anybody

238
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,079
or if you're buying anything

239
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,519
on the internet be careful what you're

240
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,918
putting in the notes don't put the words

241
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,198
kush don't put mushrooms don't put seeds

242
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,959
i don't know what you're buying

243
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,478
you could be buying a shirt with

244
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,399
mushrooms on the shirt

245
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,000
let's still not type the word mushrooms

246
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,679
in there just because that is going to

247
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
flag the algorithm on

248
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,038
your pay application so let's be a

249
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,079
little bit more careful when we're doing

250
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,680
stuff like that

251
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,120
that was a side rant but i feel like

252
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,918
that was very important for a lot of

253
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
people out there

254
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,598

vendors you can find most of them on my

345
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,480

346
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,240
to el fuego and hype seeds i haven't

347
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
added you guys to the website yet

348
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
um there's a couple reasons honestly i'm

349
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
giving you a couple time to make sure

350
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
that you guys keep going

351
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,000
and also uh it cost me a little bit to

352
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,879
do adjustments to the website i want to

353
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,159
make sure you're going to keep going

354
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,679
before i add you on there i don't want

355
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,360
to have to remove you

356
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,359
i want to make sure it's real before i

357
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,639
make it internet official

358
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
maybe if i add you on there you'll sell

359
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,480
some more seeds and we'll keep you going

360
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
but this

361
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
should give you a little bit of a boost

362
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
el fuego seeds

i mentioned it a moment ago is cannabis

373

374

you will see auctions when i've got time

380
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,639
when i know that i'll be available that

381
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,278
evening i post up an auction on cannabis

382
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,600
sometimes i do it for rare unreleased

383
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,360
exclusive limited edition seeds i'll put

384
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
up some packs that have never been seen

385
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,879
or that will never go to the vendors i

386
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,319
listed above that way you guys can get

387
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,919
some stuff that's been in my vault that

388
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
i decided i'm never gonna grow

389
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,278
you guys can get a crack at some gems

390
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,958
get some good [ __ ]

391
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,639
occasionally i'll put up bulk packs of

392
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,078
something like three or four packs of

393
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,838
stuff i've got a lot of maybe i just

394
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,278
spent the evening packing up something

395
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
realized i got a whole bunch of these

396
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,439
seeds we'll put a couple options for

397
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
those up

398
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,320
but the cannabis place is a great spot

399
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
to grab some seeds for great prices

400
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
sometimes those auctions do get

401
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,600
a little bit spendy but sometimes there

402
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
are some hot steels on there

403
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
like if i put up a pack that everybody's

404
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
already got you may be able to get it

405
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,559
for a really good

406
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,159
good price you just gotta bid see if you

407
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,119
get out bid see if you win it

408
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,759
you might get a steal on one or multiple

409
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,799
packs

410
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,559
on can a buzz another great place

411
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,759
to get irie genetic seeds this is

412
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,278
starting to sound like a [ __ ]

00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,399
infomercial we're gonna wrap this part

414
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,480

415
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,759
another place to get good ivory genetic

416
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,039
seeds is on the

417
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,200
irie genetics discord that's right we've

418
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,879
got an irie genetics discord channel a

419
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
discord server

420
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,320
shout out to my buddy dave dave's not

421
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,360
here does host

422
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,720
auctions on the discord server most of

423
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,039
the time that is going to be for

424
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,879
rare gems from the ire vault things that

425
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,000
i selected things that i packed up and

426
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,000
dave is taking the time

427
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,039
and the work to auction them for me

428
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,879
because honestly

429
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,719
i should be here writing recording doing

430
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,559
podcast editing shows working in the

431
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
garden packing up seeds

432
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,759
that is more the thing i should be doing

433
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,480
so we've got dave doing some auctions

434
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,838
for us

435
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,039
so discord and cannabis are social

436
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,560
media platforms where ire genetic

437
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,399
seeds may be available on rare if not

438
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,319
often occasion so make sure you check

439
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,679

440
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839

441
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,359

of cool coupon codes

452

that's all i think i've got for that

453
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,278
part let's move forward i do have a

454
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,679
couple of great grow questions for you

455
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,799
let's see how far we can get this one

456
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,599
came from our friend

457
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,039
they want their name said yes they want

458
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
me to use the name carl

459
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,198
this one came from the grow help tab on

460
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,120
the irie genetics website

461
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,278
uh let's see how much of this i need to

462
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,720
read to get us up to speed

463
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,078
the question is what strains are you

464
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
growing they're growing bruce banner

465
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,559
gorilla glue number four girl scout

466
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
cookies

467
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,159
and white widow to big bud that's an old

468
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,920
school lineup kind of cool

469
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,679
they're growing indoors under leds

470
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,958
they're in flower they're in week five

471
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,198
growing in soil

472
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,879
the last feed was a plain water flush

473
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,359
we'll read more about that in a moment

474
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,360
the ph was six five daytime nighttime

475
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
temps are cool humidity is cool

476
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,039
here is the problem we have a

477
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,120
description of the problem let's see

478
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,319
what's going on in my buddy carl's grow

479
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
now one weird thing you're gonna have to

480
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,480
bear with me my printer didn't print

481
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,559
this

482
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,600
in a long column it printed it two pages

483
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,198
side by side

484
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
so i have to hold the two pages side by

485
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,519
side like a book to make this work

486
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,799
so if i look like a complete weirdo on

487
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
the camera

488
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,120
if i stutter a lot extra it's because

489
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
the way the printer printed this

490
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
but i promise you we're gonna get

491
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600
through this this is the least of our

492
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,199
problems today

493
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
if this is the biggest problem we face

494
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,479
things will be just fine

495
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
i'm going to move into this here we go

496
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
it says my medium

497
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,078
is 50 50 coco fox farm soil with some

498
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,559
perlite

499
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,439
so i'm going to say 40 40 20 maybe

500
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,359
something like that

501
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
45 45 because you got it you can't have

502
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
50 50 and some perlite

503
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,479
a percentage of that is perlite anyway i

504
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
digress a few weeks ago my cheap ph pin

505
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,120
gave me incorrect readings

506
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
so i unknowingly fed my plants at a much

507
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,320
lower ph

508
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,078
than intended i'm not sure what it

509
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,079
exactly was because my ph pins were off

510
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,759
okay that's a good spot to start they

511
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,838
started showing slight the plants

512
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,198
started showing slight deficiencies or

513
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,560
possibly lockout

514
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,120
with the top leaves of the plants

515
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,198
beginning to yellow and get brown spots

516
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
once i realized this i flushed with

517
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,799
water ph

518
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,278
around 6.5 and the runoff came out at

519
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,359
4.2

520
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,679
now you said you flushed with water ph

521
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,839
about 6.5 what was it

522
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,519
my ph meter doesn't show me any ranges

523
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,240
my ph meter shows me

524
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,639
a definite number it was either six two

525
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,919
six

526
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,278
three six four six five my re

527
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,759
my meter doesn't ever show me ranges so

528
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,439
details details details it goes on it

529
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,519
says i gave what i thought was an

530
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,240
adequate amount of water to flush

531
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,679
but i did not check the runoff again so

532
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,720
you flushed out what you thought was

533
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,278
enough to flush again two to three days

534
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
later

535
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,720
i gave a light feeding of general

536
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,439
hydroponics

537
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,639
three-part flora series plus calmag

538
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
giving about 50

539
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,680
of the recommended chart for that time

540
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,240
of flower

541
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,198
the problems persisted and got slightly

542
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,879
worse

543
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,240
um at this point i think you've flushed

544
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,679
out all the nutrients there's nothing

545
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
for the plant to eat and now it's just

546
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,399
hungry

547
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
and you only gave it half of a meal so

548
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,320
it only got half of a meal

549
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,519
uh just two days ago now i gave another

550
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
flush now you're just making it more

551
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,720
hungry

552
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,958
starting at 6'5 and eventually going up

553
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,600
to 7.0 why are you moving up

554
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,000
pick a ph around between six three and

555
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,399
six

556
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,039
four maybe six five at the highest i'd

557
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
say six

558
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,278
four and stick with it consistency is

559
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
going to help you out a lot here

560
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,559
right now your plants were kind of angry

561
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,239
they had one problem

562
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,599
and now you're giving them a lot more

563
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,039
let's quit [ __ ] with them let's give

564
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,800
them some consistency

565
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,240
uh let's show them the way let's get

566
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,359
them out of the struggle with some

567
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
consistency i've said the word

568
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
consistency

569
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,119
a lot take a dab every time i say

570
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,000
consistency now

571
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,438
um so you fed them six five eventually

572
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,558
going up to seven i don't know why

573
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,600
you're changing the ph

574
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,240
pick one stick with it uh because

575
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,438
the runoff was barely climbing okay

576
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,359
maybe that makes sense

577
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
one plant the white widow got a runoff

578
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
of 4.8

579
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,360
and the bruce banner got up to 5.1 the

580
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,159
weirdest thing is the girl scout cookies

581
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,918
is the only one

582
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,120
that is unaffected and looks beautiful

583
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
that's really funny because usually that

584
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,000
girl scout cookies

585
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,359
is a real [ __ ] it's beautiful and

586
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,038
healthy while it's gotten the same

587
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,359
treatment as every other plant

588
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,038
other than most of this most recent day

589
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,678
flush i did not flush her as it looks

590
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,519
healthy

591
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,360
and i just gave her a regular feeding

592
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,200
schedule

593
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,678
all right there is more it says i do

594
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,919
believe i still need to flush again

595
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,400
i've been told to get the runoff at

596
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,679
least within 1.0 of my feed

597
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,200
so if i'm feeding 6.5 the runoff is 5.5

598
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,919
or higher

599
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
my question to that is why are you

600
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,200
growing runoff

601
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,440
are you growing trays in meters or are

602
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,558
you growing healthy cannabis plants

603
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,558
so i want to know why you need the

604
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,160
runoff within a certain spot it does

605
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,678
make sense but i want to know why

606
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
it needs to be there what your science

607
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
is behind that it's what you've been

608
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,839
told

609
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,759
is there a reason for it is it just like

610
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,399
uh rasta jeff said that purple plants

611
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,720
are the best

612
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,559
that's what the rule is uh i would do

613
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,798
some thinking some research into that

614
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,079
so uh where are we it's hard to read

615
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,879
this [ __ ] page because the way that

616
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,798
it's printed

617
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
uh or higher i just want to make sure

618
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,599
that it's still what i need to do and

619
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,759
then i'm doing it right

620
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
should i have upped the ph of the water

621
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,359
i'm flushing with to increase the runoff

622
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
faster or just pass more water through

623
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,599
it

624
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
and once i have the runoff where i

625
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,000
finally need it can i immediately finish

626
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,279
off the flush with the light feeding i

627
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
feel like these plants have

628
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,639
gotten flushed so much recently they

629
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
might be needing some nutrients

630
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
i am pretty certain that you have got an

631
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,240
empty rhizosphere

632
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,279
the plate is empty the bowl is empty and

633
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,798
these plants want

634
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,399
some food i think you've just cleaned

635
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,240
the plate cleaned out the

636
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
uh the medium there's nothing in there

637
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,558
that cocoa doesn't hold a lot you got 50

638
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
cocoa that soilless mix wasn't going to

639
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,079
hold a lot for you so you probably need

640
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,519
some nutrients in there quite soon

641
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,199
it says i'm sure you get this a lot but

642
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,119
i really love your podcast man you're a

643
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,880

easy to listen to thank you it says keep

650
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,719
up the great work man i hope to get my

651
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,599
hands on some good irie genetics for my

652
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,079
next run

653
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,038
or maybe in the summer my friend i just

654
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,879
gave you a nice

655
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,480
list of places to get those genetics so

656
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
i do hope you're able to get some irie

657
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
genetics in your garden for the summer

658
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,240
it is springtime it's time to do the

659
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
shopping now get those seeds popped

660
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,519
get your plants grown up get them cloned

661
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,159
get them sex find out if you got boys or

662
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,679
girls

663
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,120
start vegging them out get them shaped

664
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,880
and get that outdoor prepared asap

665
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,719
anyway let's talk about this these

666
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
plants

667
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
these plants have been uh through the

668
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,558
[ __ ] ringer

669
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
that had some issues your ph meter was

670
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,918
wrong you flushed the [ __ ] out of them

671
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
you kind of fed them you flushed them

672
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
again

673
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
these plants are stressed out they're in

674
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,399
shock right now they probably just want

675
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,839
a solid feeding

676
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,280
do what i call a triage a lot of times

677
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,839
when a bunch of dudes are looking at a

678
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,000
car

679
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,439
and the car has got a little problem it

680
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,519
drives me crazy when it's like eight

681
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
dudes just going ah could be the muffler

682
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,879
bearing i think it's the washer fluid

683
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,480
like are you a mechanic today you can

684
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,200
hook up a little machine to your car and

685
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,319
it'll say

686
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,759
it's the alternator it's that easy so we

687
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,038
don't have that machine for our plants

688
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,798
and i think we look [ __ ] silly

689
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,720
standing around going i think it's a ph

690
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,558
issue i think it's calmag

691
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,319
sometimes we can identify it sometimes

692
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,678
it's multiple issues sometimes it's an

693
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,678
environmental issue

694
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,200
sometimes why are we gonna sit here and

695
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
try to figure it out when

696
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
we can fix it all you got to do is

697
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,199
triage these plants

698
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,000
and do simple basic rescue techniques

699
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
and get them back

700
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,720
on track we've been [ __ ] with them

701
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,000
they're stressed out they've been

702
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,600
flushed they've been fed

703
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,599
they've been reflushed they're kind of

704
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,719
having a panic attack they want a solid

705
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,759
meal once we feed them

706
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
they're going to settle back down and

707
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,960
get into their routine so let's do what

708
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
i call

709
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,880
the triage if i go into your grow and

710
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
the plants look like [ __ ] and we can't

711
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
figure out why

712
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,839
just by looking maybe it's a calmag

713
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,599
issue maybe you've been over feeding

714
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,279
maybe it's a ph issue maybe it's all of

715
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,079
the above and it just looks like [ __ ] in

716
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,079
general

717
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,000
let's do a few things to correct the

718
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,000
room and the plants right away

719
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,599
i call it the triage i call it the

720
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,720
general health checkup you can call it a

721
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,199
lot of things but

722
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,558
first of all and then in your condition

723
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
we're gonna we already know that this is

724
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,359
ph but in most environments most

725
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,519
situations

726
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,479
i would say how is the room do we have

727
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,798
any light leaks

728
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,599
how's the vpd how's the temperature of

729
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,359
the water

730
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,879
look for stuff like that obvious signs

731
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,519
around the room we've corrected all of

732
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,200
that

733
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,639
correct all the basics then let's look

734
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,319
at the plant health

735
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
is the plant living is it going to die

736
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,798
immediately if not we can triage it

737
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,640
slowly

738
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,240
if it's got major issues we may have to

739
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
go into critical condition and do some

740
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,079
major work

741
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,439
so start maybe by removing any terrible

742
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,038
looking leaves so the plant doesn't have

743
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
to struggle with those terrible looking

744
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,038
leaves

745
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,038
then let's feed the plant mate

746
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,480
let me back up before we feed it let's

747
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,079
flush it you've already done that so i

748
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,400
tried to skip this step but

749
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,839
let's flush the plant that soil i don't

750
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,038
know what you've been feeding it

751
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,558
i know in this case what i'm saying

752
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,599
hypothetically if i'm coming into a

753
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,639
[ __ ] up garden i don't know what

754
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,678
you've been feeding i don't know what's

755
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,038
been going on i don't know what's

756
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,720
happening in that root zone

757
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,158
we can do a runoff test we can do all

758
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
kinds of stuff but

759
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,440
whatever that runoff test says i'm still

760
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,038
going to flush

761
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
i'm going to give it one good flush and

762
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,440
i don't mean like a a ridiculous

763
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,479
excessive runoff flush

764
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,720
i want about 10 to 25 runoff

765
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,880
on this initial flush i'm basically

766
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,519
resetting that rhizosphere resetting the

767
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,039
media

768
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,558
to where all the stuff you fed it all

769
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,720
the [ __ ] you locked it up with

770
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,759
is now rinsed out it's gone i've got a

771
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,600
blank canvas

772
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,200
a blank canvas sorry i tried to sneeze

773
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,480
as i said that

774
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,759
all right i think i'm back on track i

775
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
apologize for the sniffle under the

776
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,879
microphone that was [ __ ] rude and

777
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
unprofessional and i know better

778
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
not gonna edit that anyway we've got a

779
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
blank canvas to begin with

780
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,798
now this is where i would do a triage

781
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,919
feeding this is where i would mix up

782
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,960
just a good solid basic feed in my basic

783
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,799
mix there would be

784
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,360
base nutrients are we in veg are we in

785
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,879
flour get your veg or flour bottle

786
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,319
put the appropriate amount of that in

787
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
there what were you using before [ __ ]

788
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,599
went wrong

789
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,319
what were you using on a good successful

790
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,678
run

791
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,200
if you give me a bottle and i don't know

792
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,798
the brand i'm probably going to use

793
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,759
about 50 to 75

794
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,798
of those base nutrients in my mix so if

795
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,200
it says 100

796
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,720
i'm gonna put 50 to 75 in there based on

797
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
the plant health and the products i'm

798
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,558
going to read a little bit and make a

799
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,759
an educated decision but let's start off

800
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,000
with the base nutrient

801
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,919
then we need some calmag the i know that

802
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,519
calcium and magnesium are two different

803
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,799
nutrients you guys quit saying that it's

804
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,879
calming deficient

805
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,278
but most of the time they're sold in one

806
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,278
bottle so i will say calmag i know i'm

807
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,038
contradicting myself let's mix in a

808
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,480
little bit of calmag the calmac bottle

809
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,599
will be very helpful

810
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,360
then also maybe give it a little bit of

811
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,879
fulvic acid if you got some fulvic

812
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,479
that'll help you out if you've got

813
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
something like some kelp products that

814
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,759
may help you out

815
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
uh maybe some microbes will help you out

816
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,119
if you've got some recharge

817
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,399
so we got base nutrients we got calmag

818
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,319
we got fulvic acid

819
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,679
got a little bit of kelp in there uh now

820
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,038
we got a little bit of recharge in there

821
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,519
just for general health

822
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,240
let's feel ph adjust this to about six

823
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,319
four

824
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,400
i'd say six four i said about let's do

825
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,399
it six four let's not [ __ ] around

826
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
let's feed the plant this general health

827
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,759
mix until we get a little bit of runoff

828
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,840
10 15 maybe 20 percent now we know that

829
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,960
soil is saturated with good nutrients at

830
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,519
a good ph

831
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,278
you can test that runoff if you want to

832
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,960
my question is

833
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,880
are we growing runoff are we growing

834
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
plants i like the runoff i like the

835
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,440
meters i like the tests

836
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,520
but i'm going to watch the plant over

837
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,038
the next couple of days and see how it

838
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,599
responds to the feeding that we just

839
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,359
gave it

840
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,439
i think that corrected ph and those

841
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,240
proper nutrients are going to rescue

842
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
that plant

843
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,359
your rhizosphere your root zone is in

844
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,278
constant flux

845
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,119
the minute the water hits it the ph

846
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,519
changes the minute that

847
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,038
water starts evaporating and drying out

848
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,879
the ph changes

849
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,798
every few minutes as it gets a touch

850
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
drier in certain areas of that

851
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,200
rhizosphere the ph is changing

852
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
so we can't chase that ph constantly

853
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
let's pay attention

854
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,079
to the plants let's get them happy let's

855
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,918
get them fed and get them back on track

856
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,599
let's defoliate any shitty [ __ ] that

857
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
might be on there let's cut off any

858
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,240
funky branches that may be wasting space

859
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,119
and energy

860
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,200
and get the plant back on track so you

861
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,199
flushed then you flushed again

862
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,038
then you fed them halfway i think

863
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,360
they're still hungry and frustrated

864
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,119
let's mix up a good feed and feed them a

865
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,359
nice perfect meal

866
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,359
sometimes a sick plant just wants a good

867
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,119
solid healthy feeding so let's pay

868
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,719
attention to the plants after that

869
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,639
and not pay so much attention to the

870
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
meters because

871
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,759
the meters are what got you here in the

872
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,839
first place i love

873
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,079
all of the equipment i love all of the

874
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,278
toys i love to use all of that stuff to

875
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,599
my advantage but

876
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,038
sometimes we've got to watch the plants

877
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
and we've got to remember that the

878
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,400
plants are the boss

879
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
we're not growing i keep saying it we're

880
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
not growing ph meters we're not growing

881
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
runoff water

882
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,360
we're not growing minder units or pulse

883
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,079
units we're growing cannabis plants so

884
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,119
pay attention

885
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,119
to those plants i was growing

886
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,158
awesome herb before i had all of this

887
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,399
technology

888
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,400
and sometimes i wonder if this

889
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
technology is messing up my ability to

890
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,360
grow because

891
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,720
i catch myself checking data logs vpd

892
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,879
logs i should be looking at the plants

893
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,558
anyway i digress you get the point the

894
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,400
point is the plants are the boss

895
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,079
um pay attention to those plants give

896
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,080
them a nice solid feed i don't think you

897
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,558
need to keep flushing i think flushing

898
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,759
uh has been done that's been done what

899
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,038
are you going to do just keep flushing

900
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,720
them starve them to death until they're

901
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,200
all yellow and completely [ __ ] up

902
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,558
let's give them a nice solid feed pay

903
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,400
attention to that feed

904
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,918
if it looks like they're taking it feed

905
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
them again the same way if it looks like

906
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,520
something is not working

907
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720
let's adjust our feet accordingly i

908
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,639
think you were giving it a

909
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,558
a little bit high ph and you had a ph

910
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,799
range let's get a ph spot

911
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,798
write it down and do that every day when

912
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,359
you feed it your triage mix write that

913
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,119
down

914
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,599
write down how many mils of each bottle

915
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,278
you put in write down what the ec or ppm

916
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,399
of the feed is before you feed it write

917
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,240
down the ph

918
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,759
if you want to do the test coming out

919
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,798
see what happens when you feed it coming

920
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,240
out

921
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,000
keep doing that for the next couple of

922
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,919
feeds then if you need to email

923
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
me again send me some pictures let me

924
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,840
know what's going on we can adjust from

925
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
there

926
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,759
but i think after a couple of feeds

927
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
these plants will rebound

928
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,679
and everything we'll be right back on

929
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,119
track uh let's see where you are i think

930
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,080
you're in the flowering phase you're in

931
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,239
week five

932
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,599
you've only got four to five weeks to go

933
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,640
you're going to start flushing in two

934
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,240
weeks anyway

935
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,679
hopefully you got these plants back on

936
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
track hopefully you got a big fat

937
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,320
harvest

938
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,319
hopefully we get an update from you

939
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,879
hopefully you have great success

940
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,359
and also hopefully this was a learning

941
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,679
lesson

942
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,278
let's not rely too much on all of that

943
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,600
equipment let's pay more attention to

944
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:59,119
the plants and less equip less attention

945
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,879
to the toys and equipment

946
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,398
all right i'm going to jump into one

947
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
more question here i think we can cover

948
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,798
this one up before this podcast gets too

949
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
long

950
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,879
this one comes from our friend he wants

951
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,960
to be called fox ah this again came from

952
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
the grow help tab on the website i'm

953
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,519
gonna take a quick

954
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,640
sip here before we continue so you don't

955
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,278
have to keep listening to my voice

956
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,559
crackle

957
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,558

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,120
pineapple and coconut juice

961
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,960
that is so good anyway you're not here

962

to this is not juice with jeff this is

963
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,798
the grow from your heart podcast

964
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,000
let's talk about my friend fox and his

965
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,879
grow

966
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,359
fox is growing uh underdog og from th

967
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
seeds

968
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,639
shout out to my buddy adam dunn and th

969
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,440
seeds hope you guys are well it's being

970
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,759
grown indoors under an led it is in veg

971
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,440
um this is still in the seedling stage

972
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,558
previously we've done a podcast talking

973
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
about stages

974
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,599
this is officially the seedling stage

975
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,879
right now i think you're about

976
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,158
a couple more uh maybe like a few days a

977
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,840
week away from actually saying this may

978
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,960
be vegeta we'll include a picture

979
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,798
somewhere in the video uh it goes uh

980
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,720
last feed let me catch up to where i was

981
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,558
veg that's where we are what week not

982
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,600
even in a week yet what medium living

983
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,879
soil

984
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,079
last feed about four ounces of recharge

985
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,559
that little plant didn't need four

986
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,119
ounces of recharge but that's okay

987
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,480
the temps are okay the humidity is okay

988
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,079
here is the question

989
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,519
the problem what's up ross to jeff i

990
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,158
hope everything is irie i don't

991
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,278
necessarily

992
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,399
have a problem but my question is

993
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,759
is this normal node spacing and if you

994
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:34,558
look at the picture it's a little tiny

995
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,480
plant that's

996
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,599
a little bit stretched which doesn't

997
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,919
have enough

998
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,759
development to have what i would call

999
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,038
node spacing the space between these

1000
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,558
little starter leaves

1001
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,839
that first set of leaves that second

1002
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:46,798
little set of growth and then what's

1003
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,480
coming out

1004
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,480
that is beautiful spacing but you are

1005
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,558
barely getting taken off right now

1006
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
the thing i would recommend uh the thing

1007
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,558
i notice most that i want to comment on

1008
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,038
is the leggy length between the cup

1009
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,678
and the start of the growth this is what

1010
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,879
i would call

1011
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,640
a very leggy stretchy seedling

1012
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
this ceiling is telling me that it wants

1013
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,200
more light and that it wants

1014
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,640
a fan i'm going to assume let's read

1015
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,399
more because i do see

1016
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,840
answers to my questions because i've got

1017
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,479
questions too

1018
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,720
um is the node spacing normal or is this

1019
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,240
too close i ask because i watch a lot of

1020
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,000
videos on youtube and their plants

1021
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
always look a lot taller

1022
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,038
than mine but at the same uh with the

1023
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,120
but the same amount of nodes relatively

1024
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,319
to the day i have a 50 watt

1025
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,759
do-it-yourself

1026
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,960
house led led bulbs with the plastic cut

1027
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,679
off and then he explains the bulbs a

1028
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
little bit

1029
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,440
i got them on amazon all of my plants

1030
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,798
veg like this and i don't know if maybe

1031
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,240
the lights are too close

1032
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,839
they're about 20 inches off the floor

1033
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,399
about 12 inches away from the top of the

1034
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,639
plant

1035
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,519
or is it too much light for the 18 by 18

1036
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,278
veg box

1037
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,119
thanks in advance if you get this one i

1038
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,440
got this one bro you're very welcome

1039
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,119
the pen is to give reference of the

1040
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,798
space between nodes

1041
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,199
peace and much love where's the pen i

1042
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,558
don't see the pen is there a pen in here

1043
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
might have been another picture is that

1044
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,398
a pen in the background

1045
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,159
where's the pin dude anyway let's not

1046
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,119
focus on the pin that's not here in the

1047
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,159
picture

1048
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,079
um i honestly think that

1049
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,440
uh the plant looks okay it looks

1050
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,199
basically fine it shouldn't be that tall

1051
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,880
oh excuse me for being that tall that

1052
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
plant doesn't have enough growth

1053
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,080
the growth should be coming out of the

1054
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,919
top of the plant and your growth is

1055
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,639
coming from the bottom of your plant

1056
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,720
that's why you got that long really long

1057
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,559
branch that thing's probably

1058
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
six or eight inches long it looks like

1059
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,119
and then you get your little sprout

1060
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,960
and then you got a little bit of growth

1061
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,879
coming out of it i think you could

1062
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,360
possibly get that light a little bit

1063
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,799
closer if they start drooping during the

1064
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,158
day then you're getting enough light you

1065
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,599
can raise it up if they start looking

1066
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,080
crispy or getting a little bit dry you

1067
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,038
can raise

1068
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,720
it up but by the skinniness of that

1069
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,278
stock and the lack of growth in that

1070
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,038
plant

1071
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,640
i would say that it probably wants a

1072
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,158
little bit more light

1073
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,320
than something i would recommend just to

1074
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,840
make it grow a little bit more stout and

1075
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,038
a little bit more hardy i would put a

1076
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,199
fan on that thing

1077
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,519
if you blew some breeze on it it would

1078
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,159
probably uh make that stick a little bit

1079
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,679
more

1080
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,840
more robust it would give it a little

1081
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,679
more uh just it'd be thicker

1082
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,599
give it more girth it'd be just bigger

1083
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,960
and stronger a little bit of wind it's

1084
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,319
going to learn to fight that wind it's

1085
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,798
going to learn just to stay up in the

1086
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,119
wind

1087
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,158
it'll be stronger thicker just a bigger

1088
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,239
fatter plant

1089
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,080
so i don't think the light is too far

1090
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,880
away i don't think the light

1091
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,480
ah i think it wants more light basically

1092
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
that is the the bottom line here that

1093
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,480
plant just wants

1094
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,398
more light all together so uh your veg

1095
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,120
space wants more light overall in my

1096
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,119
opinion

1097
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,639
if you can add more light i would add

1098
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,719
more if you can't add more

1099
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,880
uh this is going to work but you're

1100
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,159
gonna have stretchy plants you'll notice

1101
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,480
if you increase the light the plants

1102
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
will

1103
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,599
stay short and they'll get branchy and

1104
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,038
bushy

1105
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,000
these are going to get tall and skinny

1106
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,200
and you won't see a lot of branching

1107
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,278
excuse me for that i had to move the

1108
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,240
microphone away for that one let's just

1109
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,319
keep moving here

1110
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,440
anyway to my friend let's see what you

1111
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,798
said your name was because i've got your

1112
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,679
real name on the screen to my friend

1113
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,798
fox uh basically i would recommend more

1114
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,559
light you've got a

1115
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:11,038
um a 2700 kelvin a 5000

1116
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,480
kelvin um yeah you basically need more

1117
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:13,278
light in there i would just add more

1118
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,360
light

1119
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,640
um if you can get an led or something

1120
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,000
that's a little bit bigger a little bit

1121
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
brighter i might do that

1122
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,519
it's going to grow just fine with this

1123
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,600
but it could grow even better

1124
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,880
with the appropriate light so i keep

1125
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,000
repeating myself i feel like i've

1126
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,919
answered your question
