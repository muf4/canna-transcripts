in today's episode we're going to talk

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,558
about selecting mail plants for breeding

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,519
before we jump into that I do want to

11
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,878
give you a quick heads up there will not

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,760
be a podcast episode next week I'm going

13
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,640
to take a little short vacation I'm

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,039
going to take the week off of podcasting

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,679
I will be back in two weeks with fresh

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,640
new content now let's jump into the main

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,000
portion of today's podcast I do have a

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,600
website that website of course is iy

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,640
genetics.com on the top of that website

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,439
there's a row of tabs one of those tabs

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,079
does say grow help or grow questions if

22
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,359
you click on that Tab and send me a good

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,118
grow question if I read your grow

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,879
question here on the podcast I will send

25
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,400
you a coupon code for a free pack of

26
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,039
seeds at idirect tocom today's question

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,080
of course was about selecting male

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,240
plants for breeding the question came

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,039
from our new friend bearclaw bearclaw

30
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,359
big shout out my bro make sure you check

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,799

free pack of seeds at idirect tocom now

34
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,679
the question from bearclaw goes a little

35
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,640
bit like this it says yo rosted Jeff

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,799
what steps do you take to identify a

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,239
breeder male do you compare against

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,600
multiple males of the same strain or

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,359
just save a particular particularly

40
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,438
Hardy male when you do find one now that

41
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,280
is a really good question uh this does

42
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,078
spark a lot of conversation in my mind I

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,759
feel like I'm fairly good at selecting

44
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,478
male plants I've got a lot of confidence

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,920
in selecting male plants and breeding

46
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,438
pears I think that shows in my selection

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,079
of King Solomon King Solomon was my

48
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,919
arise male it is a Golden Goat female

49
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,718
pollinated by a daybreaker male that

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,959
made arise plants I found a male plant

51
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:12,519
in that batch that was so good he got

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,920
his own name he is called King Solomon

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,400
uh you can do some research on King

54
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,559
Solomon if you'd like to know more about

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,760
why I named him that but King Solomon

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,159
has been used in hundreds of crosses

57
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,039
I've made uh hund probably a hundred I

58
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,239
want to realistically say a hundred

59
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,639
different crosses with King Solomon and

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,280
probably 95 of them were complete fire

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,119
uh everything King Solomon touched

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,959
turned to Gold he was an awesome

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,959
breeding plant I think another good

64
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,640
example of my male selection is the Jack

65
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,959
the Ripper mail that I selected from the

66
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,719
seeds from subcool shout out to my buddy

67
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,680
subcool that Jack the Ripper mail made

68
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,158
more amazing proy the blueberry butcher

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,519
uh the Jack Tripper of course all the uh

70
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,598
Jack the Ripper f2s I feel like I did a

71
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,158
very good job at selecting that one

72
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,919
another great mail that I do use of

73
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,878
course is the BC Lemon Skunk mail uh

74
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,878
that male is super vigorous super hearty

75
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,639
it puts amazing Aromas and flavors into

76
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,759
things uh it does take a little bit of

77
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,119
time to flower in some crosses but I

78
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,399
like that uh not everybody does but I do

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,680
enjoy a longer flowering plant what's

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,158
another good mail that I have uh

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,959
selected oh the male chaloupe that I

82
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,959
selected to make the big mountain fudge

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
cake that was another amazing mail plant

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,759
that made a lot of great progyny which

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,319
uh most of those have not been released

86
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,359
so stay tuned maybe just maybe I'll put

87
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,919
out more of those chalou crosses in the

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,040
future but those are many uh if not all

89
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,318
of the male plants which I have selected

90
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,679
uh that I've used in my breeding

91
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:36,679
projects that show that I do have a

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,959
pretty good eye for selecting male

93
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,519
plants so let's talk a little bit about

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,680
how I choose these plants for selection

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,680
there are a lot of things we could talk

96
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,040
about a lot of ways to open this up the

97
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,040
first thing I want to talk about is have

98
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,479
a goal every good breeding project needs

99
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,519
a goal in mind your male plant is going

100
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,318
to be half of your outcome so have an

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,200
idea of what you want to create because

102
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,479
your mail is going to contribute to half

103
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,598
of that your progyny will half of the

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,959
attributes that your male plant has got

105
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,318
so keep that in mind also you're going

106
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,560
to have attributes from those female

107
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,479
plants which we breed it to but have a

108
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,318
goal in mind is going to be my first

109
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,280
thing to talk about if you're breeding

110
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,759
have a goal a lot of times you may just

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,000
stumble across a St a stellar male plant

112
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,120
that just talks to you and you don't

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,680
have a goal that always works but if you

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,918
really want to start a solid breeding

115
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,600
project have a goal in mind uh I

116
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,639
recommend learning about mendal charts

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,680
or Leo charts and doing things like that

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
now let's actually focus in on selecting

119
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,879
these male PL plants uh let's

120
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,079
hypothetically say that we acquired a

121
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,159
10pack of regular male female seeds

122
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,959
we've got 10 seeds uh we are going to

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,240
germinate those 10 seeds now most likely

124
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,799
we are going to find five males and five

125
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,960
females the numbers could be skewed a

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,840
little bit but for this scenario for

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,120
this selection process we got lucky we

128
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,359
got five beautiful males five beautiful

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,439
females we're going to put the female

130
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,400
plants away for now this conversation

131
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,120
we're going to focus on selecting this

132
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,959
male plant for breeding now amongst

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,478
these five male plants you said

134
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,038
something at the be beginning here that

135
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,038
got my attention you said uh save a

136
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,120
particular particularly Hardy male when

137
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,519
you find one now that that set off a

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,680
buzzer in my head because I usually do

139
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,079
not choose the most Hardy male in a

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
selection so let's just say I've got

141
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,439
these five male plants the first one

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,038
maybe the first two to show me that it's

143
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,240
male is not my breeding candidate those

144
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:29,199
are not the plants I want to choose for

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
a couple of reasons first of all that

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
plant is probably going to get real tall

147
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,559
and real stretchy and be real fibrous it

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,079
would be an amazing hemp plant if I

149
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,478
wanted to make fibers ropes textiles

150
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,000
something like that this plant would be

151
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,918
beautiful but that's not what I'm

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,680
breeding for I want to make sticky icky

153
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,439
buds with high high potency a lot of

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,879
tricomes beautiful colors flavors and

155
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,639
Aromas so I don't want that hemp kind of

156
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,918
plant that long stretchy super

157
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,280
structurer branchy plant that's not what

158
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,839
I'm breeding for I'm breeding for a

159
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,159
different thing my other idea about this

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,000
plant is those first two plants to show

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
that they are male they're a little bit

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
too male dominant the way that I can

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
describe that is think about this

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,759
imagine Brock Lesnar many of you already

165
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,598
know who Brock Lesnar is many of you may

166
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,000
not have any clue Brock Lesnar was a UFC

167
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,439
fighter was also a professional wrestler

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,680
uh he's a big dude he was also a

169
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,800
powerlifter he is a gigantic man uh I'm

170
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,240
a big dude and I think Brock Lesnar is

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
[ __ ] gigantic compared to me uh he's

172
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,120
got to be I didn't research this but

173
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,399
he's got to be [ __ ] 65 260 something

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,918
like that maybe 280 he's a big [ __ ]

175
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,239
guy he's built like a brick [ __ ] house

176
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,879
he's nothing but muscle he is a solid

177
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,000
muscular dude he's a fighter he's a

178
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,159
wrestler got a lot of testosterone going

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,079
on in his body ah big beefy [ __ ] dude

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,400
that's how I would compare those first

181
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,918
two males to show that they are male in

182
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,799
my batch of seeds which there's nothing

183
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,198
wrong with being a big beefy muscular

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,520
[ __ ] masculine dude however when I do

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
my breeding project I don't want all of

186
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,159
my Offspring to look just like my

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,720
starting male I'd like to have the

188
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,599
opport for the female plants to express

189
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
themselves in my breeding project that

190
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,439
is the whole purpose of this idea here

191
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,479
if I wanted to recreate that male plant

192
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,279
I would just recreate that that's

193
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,800
another talk now one thing I want to

194
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,878
point out is uh recently I saw a picture

195
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,439
of Brock Lesnar's daughter and it

196
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,520
totally supported this theory that I

197
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,759
have had for years I never knew this

198
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,959
until recently Brock Lesnar's daughter

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
looks just [ __ ] like him she's a big

200
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,758
lifter as well she's shaped just like

201
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,120
him got the same face same facial

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,680
expression same hairline the poor girl

203
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,759
looks just like Brock Lesnar which sort

204
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,079
of supports my idea that his jeans

205
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
totally dominated that breeding project

206
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,878
we don't even know what the mom looks

207
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,240
like but I know that that daughter looks

208
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,120
just like Brock Lesnar and I feel like

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
if you take that first male to show that

210
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,598
it's a male you're going to get Brock

211
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,318
Lesnar plants out of it you're not going

212
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,800
to get to see their feminine qualities

213
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,080
their beauty you're just going to get

214
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,400
reproductions of that male and it's also

215
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,918
in my mind going to be a lot of branchy

216
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,519
stocky uh hempy type of plant so out of

217
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,959
these five male plants we've got from

218
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,878
seed I usually do not select the first

219
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,839
two or the last one to show me that it's

220
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,520
male usually it's that third or fourth

221
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,519
one is my selection uh when I'm choosing

222
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,000
just that's kind of my my precursor I

223
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,719
don't like that first one that second

224
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,839
one sometimes I'll let it pass if

225
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,560
they're not showing me that they are too

226
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,598
uh way too uh too cocky too dominant if

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,639
they're not dragging their [ __ ]

228
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,279
Knuckles on the floor not drooling uh

229
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,079
maybe perhaps I'll let those slide but

230
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,878
that is kind of a rule of thumb like my

231
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,598
first little screener of when I'm

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,599
Growing Seeds what I see did this maale

233
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,759
pop out right away and become way too

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,719
vigorous also that male plant that tries

235
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,639
to get real real tall and grow way above

236
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,000
everybody that plant's got to go don't

237
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,439
breed with that one because guess what

238
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,360
it's going to do it's going to breed a

239
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,959
bunch of me tall and [ __ ] skinny and

240
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,959
lanky and you don't need that in the

241
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,439
garden so my first step of advice uh the

242
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,719
first step was to have a goal have

243
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
something in mind which you want to

244
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,519
create my second step of advice is out

245
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,679
of those five male plants out of that

246
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,399
pack of seeds don't pick numbers one and

247
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,439
two to show you that they're a male keep

248
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
an eye on three and four uh those are

249
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,120
probably your good candidates for

250
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
breeding now let's talk a little bit

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,839
more about visual traits that I do see

252
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,838
in these male plants to help us identify

253
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,560
if they are good breeding candidates of

254
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,079
course they've got to fit the criteria

255
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,759
for your goal do you want to make tall

256
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,599
slender plants do you want to make short

257
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,480
squatty plants do you want to make

258
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,000
plants with big fat wide leaves do you

259
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,159
want to make plants with narrow skinny

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,799
leaves do you want to make plants that

261
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,719
uh give you a crazy head Buzz do you

262
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,679
want to make plants that make you chill

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,759
out and want to take a nap that is all

264
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,679
going to have to do with your selection

265
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,399
so keep all of that in mind but visually

266
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,039
things that we can see are basic

267
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,679
structure is this male plant sturdy is

268
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,120
it Stout is it able to hold itself up if

269
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,879
you had a female plant with that

270
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
structure that had buds on it big

271
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,480
flowers on it would that be a good a

272
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,440
good shape and a good frame to support a

273
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,399
nice amount of weight and flowers on

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,839
that plant or is this male plant wispy

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,679
falling over not uh not able to support

276
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,320
itself once it gets big into flower does

277
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,399
the top start tipping over do the bottom

278
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,278
start flopping everywhere think about

279
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
the shape the frame and the structure of

280
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,120
this plant because that is going to play

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,360
heavily into your progyny much of the

282
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,000
shape and structure will show up in the

283
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,000
children so think about that what about

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,039
Leaf size and shape that that gives us a

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,278
lot of details about how long it will

286
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,759
take to flower about what type of Buzz

287
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,078
to expect from it so look at the leaf

288
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,799
size and shape because the structure the

289
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:32,559
leaf size and shape that's all going to

290
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,799
play into the progyny how about Vigor

291
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,518
how quickly does this plant grow when he

292
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,159
sprouted the seed how quickly did it

293
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,320
take off how long did it take for that

294
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,078
first set of true leaves to come how did

295
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,079
it veg uh also think about abuse did

296
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,799
this plant tolerate any abuse did you

297
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,519
give it a drought did you overwater it

298
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,759
did it get spidermites was it resistant

299
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,440
to pathogens and pest those are all

300
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,278
things to think about when looking for a

301
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,160
male plant but visually we can see Leaf

302
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,360
size and shape we can see structure of

303
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,838
the plant overall we can see sturdiness

304
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,600
of the branches then we can also see if

305
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,200
there is any color is this plant putting

306
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,600
out any cool colors if the plant

307
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,160
displays cool colors you just might get

308
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
some colors passed down into your

309
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,759
progeny you may get some purple uh some

310
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,720
dark colored uh Offspring if you've got

311
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,559
some cool colored plants how about

312
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,480
tricomes does your male plant put out

313
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,518
tricomes I definitely love to breed with

314
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,278
the male plant that puts out tricomes

315
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,000
because that translates into more

316
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,519
tricomes in the progyny what about

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,879
branching Style um some plants like to

318
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,600
go up and then they Branch out real wide

319
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,320
some plants like to go kind of up and

320
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,399
then they just put a lot of equilateral

321
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
branches off to them some Branch off

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
almost sideways some Branch off almost

323
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
straight up pay attention to the

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,360
branching also something to think about

325
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,039
take a clone off this plant how easily

326
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,240
does it clone because that will play

327
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,000
into your progyny now how long does it

328
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,720
take to flow are you going to flower

329
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,919
this plant I like to flower my male

330
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,519
plants before I use them for anything

331
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,639
I'll flower that plant out and see how

332
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,600
long it takes to flower how long does it

333
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,720
take for that plant to start showing me

334
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,200
flower clusters how long until I get

335
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,519
pollen how much pollen does this plant

336
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
put out if it only puts out a little bit

337
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,039
of pollen it might not be worth breeding

338
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
if it's a dumper with pollen we're going

339
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,319
to love that if all the other traits

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
line up um does it smell good we've

341
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,560
talked about that before give it a stem

342
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,360
rub smell that stem does it smell good

343
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,518
let it get into flour a little bit smell

344
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,360
those flowers do they have good Aromas

345
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,759
some of those Aromas and flavors will

346
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,800
translate to the progyny something I say

347
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,519
a lot

348
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,120
I like a breeder mail that smells like a

349
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,078
bar trash can and hot vomit I know that

350
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,879
sounds weird but that always translates

351
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,399
to good Offspring what about flowering

352
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,720
time we talked about this briefly a

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
moment ago when you initiate flower on

354
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
this male plant how long does it take to

355
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,159
show you I'm a male plant how long does

356
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
it take to say I'm going to really start

357
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,360
banging out male flowers how long does

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
it take to start dropping pollen how

359
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,800
long does it continue to drop pollen how

360
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,399
big does that big maale cluster get when

361
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,120
you get laid into flower with this male

362
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,559
plant and yes recommend flowering your

363
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,278
male plants 7 8 n maybe 10 weeks if you

364
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,000
can do it see what this bad [ __ ] does

365
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,360
see if it Herms on you she see if it

366
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,399
shows you any problems see if it can

367
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,000
handle any stress see if it does weird

368
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,600
[ __ ] at week nine because sometimes

369
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,720
you'll notice things laid in flow that

370
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,320
you did not notice early on and you may

371
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,320
be glad you didn't select that plan uh

372
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,278
where are we pollen time and amount I've

373
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,399
said this a moment ago does it put out

374
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,480
enough pollen I'm a breeder I breed for

375
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,159
commercial purposes if I've got a plant

376
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,560
that only puts out sprinkles of dust

377
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,480
that old dude doesn't get to party in my

378
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,518
room I need a young dude that's ready to

379
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
throw out a big amount of pollen so I

380
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,120
can make a big amount of seeds uh what

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,120
about flower size and shape uh I looked

382
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
for a male plant with a nice big fat top

383
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Cola that tells me that guess what my

384
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,560
Offspring is going to make a big fat top

385
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,120
Cola is it shaped well um I like when

386
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,599
the the top Cola is not just long and

387
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,679
skinny I want it to get kind of bulky

388
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,839
and kind of fat uh that's something that

389
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,919
I like also the shape really matters I

390
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,160
talked about tricomes a moment to go

391
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,879
what other notable characteristics do

392
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,919
you see in this male plant that stand

393
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,399
out to you because uh all of those

394
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,519
traits are going to pass along into your

395
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,639
Offspring so um I look I look for a male

396
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,600
plant from seed that doesn't flower too

397
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,799
quickly isn't too eager to show me that

398
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
it's a dude I like a male plant with a

399
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,198
nice structure and shape what does that

400
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,799
mean that all depends on what my goal is

401
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,319
uh something that can support itself

402
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,240
something that can tolerate popping and

403
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,759
twisting a little bit of uh super

404
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,639
cropping if you will I like to pop and

405
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,800
twist the plants I do a little bit of

406
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
defoliation does that stuff stress out

407
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,719
the plant does my basic uh function in

408
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,799
the grow room stress out that plant if

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,278
it does I don't want to work with it

410
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,719
something I specifically think about uh

411
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,559
am I breeding these seeds for me to play

412
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,120
with to make more new [ __ ] or am I

413
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,719
breeding these for the market um I may

414
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,480
choose different males if I'm breeding

415
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,240
it for my personal use or if I'm

416
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,959
breeding it as something to put out to

417
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,360
the market I need something more easy to

418
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,078
grow more reliable for the market I can

419
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,079
breed the challenging uh 16 week [ __ ]

420
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,599
real weirdos uh finicky feeders that

421
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,479
[ __ ] uh that's for me so sometimes I

422
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,079
make a decision in that so I'm looking

423
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,759
at them visually I'm looking at the leaf

424
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,559
size the leaf shape I'm looking at the

425
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,039
color I'm giving it a smell um I'm

426
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,838
trying to give them a little bit of a

427
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,719
drought I'm trying to overwater them um

428
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,560
I like to see if they clone well what's

429
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,278
the use of having this plant if I cannot

430
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,399
clone it so I'll definitely take a

431
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,439
couple of clones and I'll take one in I

432
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,000
use Rapid rooters and a dome I also like

433
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,920
to use an easy cloner maybe I'll take

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,399
could clone in both and see which one

435
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,240
loves it and which one doesn't love it

436
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,720
if they both love it we're in business

437
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,159
we're going to definitely use this plant

438
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,959
in a project uh what else can I cover

439
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,278
for you I wrote down noticeable

440
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,638
characteristics what stands out to you

441
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,838
sometimes when you walk by a plant you

442
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,399
just go oh that plant right there and

443
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,120
this is I call this my breeder intuition

444
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,480
I always say learn mental charts learn

445
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,879
aliel charts uh read about Robert

446
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,240
Connell Clark's uh botney books learn

447
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,399
about all of the breeding books from

448
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,039
Greg green learn everything breeding

449
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,000
book learn about what Gregor mendle was

450
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,958
up to then when it all comes down to

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,679
breeding forget all of that and breed

452
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,638
with intuition grow from your heart and

453
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,318
breed with love when I walk through a

454
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,198
commercial facility or sometimes I'll be

455
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,240
at a friend's grow and I'll see a plant

456
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,799
and I'll go bro that one it's just like

457
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
when you're at a concert or at the club

458
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,639
or sometimes even at the [ __ ] grocery

459
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,600
store or quite often at Target settle

460
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,639
down ladies at Target but you'll fall in

461
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
love you'll be walking through and

462
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,600
you'll be like damn that's the one uh

463
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
some that's how breeding with plants

464
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,600
works for me um I fell in love with a

465
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,039
lot of plants uh and commercial

466
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,920
facilities that I've been in through the

467
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,360
years so I'll see this plant and I'll

468
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,198
say something about this plant is

469
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,959
special and then we'll grow it a bunch

470
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,159
of times and it'll get to experience a

471
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,919
drought uh overwatering uh overfeeding

472
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,039
underfeeding perhaps a spider might

473
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,599
attack maybe we'll get powdery mildew

474
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,639
and in a commercial grow I get to see

475
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,000
how all these plants react to all that

476
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,399
and then when they react right that's

477
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,958
when I go ahead and get myself a cut

478
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,799
enter that into my garden and we start

479
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,119
breeding with it so I've seen a lot of

480
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,000
beautiful things in other Gardens um

481
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,159
I've got a beautiful cut of the cream I

482
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
haven't talked too much about this yet I

483
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,480
found a cut of the cream in a in a local

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,720
friend's grow I've got a friend that I

485
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,558
work with uh he used to live right down

486
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,078
the street I found a beautiful cut of

487
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,599
the of the cream in his garden uh he

488
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,918
does not want his name set on the show

489
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,838
shout out bro you know who you are I

490
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,759
know you listen you're probably

491
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,480
listening with your wife shout out wife

492
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,318
also but anyway my friends found a

493
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,519
beautiful phenotype of the cream I've

494
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,639
got a cut of that and I plan to reverse

495
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,038
that and make feminized seeds with that

496
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,400
in the future because that plant was

497
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,519
just so beautiful

498
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,559
I hit every note when I saw it in veg I

499
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,599
was like that thing's going to do

500
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,000
something special early in flower I

501
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,119
smelled it I was like damn this [ __ ] is

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,919
a winner later on in flower it kind of

503
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,558
lost some of the aroma but the the veg

504
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,400
shape and structure in time was

505
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,678
beautiful when it went into flower the

506
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,080
flowering time was beautiful it set Bud

507
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,160
set beautifully it wasn't over leafy it

508
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,079
had enough Leaf to keep the plant alive

509
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,880
but it was easy to trim when it got more

510
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,199
into flower the buds got beautiful they

511
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
got beautiful colors to them uh it got

512
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,360
real thick layers of Trion

513
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,000
uh this plant was beautiful so that is a

514
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,639
beautiful female plant that just spoke

515
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,798
to me and I've chosen that to be one of

516
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
my next reversals I've got a couple

517
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,918
things lined up but that is definitely

518
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,280
getting pushed up the list because it

519
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,120
impressed me so much so sometimes I'm

520
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,158
just walking through a grow just minding

521
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,239
my own business and holy [ __ ] that plan

522
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,760
is beautiful something just calls me

523
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,319
something just dings at me like I said

524
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,319
when you're at the club when you're at

525
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,918
wherever you go do your thing for me

526
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,119
it's sometimes a drum circle a fish

527
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,559
concert dead and co uh who knows where I

528
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,279
could be sometimes you just see somebody

529
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,079
and your jaw drops and your eyes go blah

530
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,519
blah blah blah blah like a cartoon and

531
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,798
you want to breed with that person I

532
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,000
have the same feeling about plants I

533
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,079
feel like I'm a a plant Matchmaker I

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
just see two plants and I go hey Solomon

535
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,480
do you know strawberry star or

536
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,080
Strawberry Fields you guys get together

537
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,038
and a couple weeks ago bro we got or a

538
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,720
couple weeks go by and we have got

539
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,240
strawberry Starburst plants all right

540
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,038
I'm super rambling kind of losing track

541
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,599
of where I am so let me get myself back

542
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,200
on Focus now once you feel like you have

543
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,038
selected a male plant there is only one

544
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,080
tried and true way to make sure that

545
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,200
this dude is what you think he is and

546
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,079
that is in my opinion to pollinate

547
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,440
multiple females I've been preaching

548
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,158
this method for uh quite a while now why

549
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,200
do I say pollinate multiple females

550
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,520
because if you pollinate only one female

551
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,798
plant with this male we only get to see

552
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,038
what the interaction is with one plant

553
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,200
and one set of Offspring so let's just

554
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,200
say and I'm going to just start getting

555
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,840
creative here let's just say we've got a

556
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,080
chocolate plant everybody would like a

557
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,678
chocolate male plant this plant is it

558
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,879
smells like chocolate it looks like

559
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
chocolate it's called chocolate

560
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,080
something we got a chocolate plant now

561
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,640
let's just say we got a strawberry plant

562
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,399
I want to breed chocolate to Strawberry

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,360
that sounds [ __ ] delicious right

564
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,200
we're probably going to get a lot of

565
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,199
chocolate strawberry phenotypes that's

566
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,600
cool that doesn't tell us a lot that

567
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,919
tells me that when I breed chocolate to

568
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,918
Strawberry I get chocolate strawberry I

569
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,240
have no gauge of what's really going on

570
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,080
other than I can see strawberry traits

571
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,558
and I can see chocolate traits I know

572
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,918
that these two plants they breed that

573
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,798
way why I want to breed it to multip

574
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,559
plants let put let's put chocolate to

575
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,000
bananas and let's also put chocolate to

576
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,798
vanilla and then when we do that we're

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,640
going to grow out all those seeds and

578
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,879
now we can see the commonalities that

579
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,200
come from this male plant do we get uh

580
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,799
big fat leaves in all of the crosses

581
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
because if all of the crosses show big

582
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,558
fat leaves that shows me that's coming

583
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
from that male plant so if I cross that

584
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,798
same chocolate plant to strawberry

585
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,480
vanilla and banana and only banana gives

586
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,759
me big fat leaves and strawberry and

587
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
vanilla give me skinny leaves maybe it's

588
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,359
the banana cross that is making those

589
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,079
big leaves if neither one of the plants

590
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:35,439
showed big leaves in the apparent plant

591
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,439
that could be a recessive trait that we

592
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,798
didn't know was coming so that's why I

593
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,159
recommend breeding that plant to

594
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,480
multiple things you may see traits pop

595
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,840
up in the breeding that you didn't

596
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
realize were coming from that male we

597
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,158
don't know so if you see a recessive

598
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,038
trait like I just mentioned let's say we

599
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,120
cross that chocolate to the strawberry

600
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,960
and we get uh they've both got really

601
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,839
skinny leaves and we cross those

602
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,919
together and we get real big leaves out

603
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,480
of the progyny which one of those made

604
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,320
that because that is a recessive trait

605
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,599
that we've never seen before I don't

606
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,319
know if that came from the male or the

607
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:10,000
female Also let's talk about the dreaded

608
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,119
intersects the hermaphrodite trade if I

609
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,440
cross my mail to one plant and those

610
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,839
seeds are hermaphrodites or intersects

611
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,120
how do I know if it came from that

612
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,759
female or that male plant if I run that

613
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,678
male to three different girls if one of

614
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,519
them shows intersex it's likely it was

615
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,679
that one female that held the interex

616
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,079
trait if two of them are solid and not

617
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,720
interex we probably got a good male if

618
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,918
all three of them are intersects guess

619
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,759
what it's the male that is doing it so

620
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,200
that's why I recommend using that male

621
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,400
to multiple females to actually see what

622
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,440
he is doing what he actually brings to

623
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,798
the mix and then what's more fun than

624
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
running three different sets of uh new

625
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,359
new seeds and finding out what you

626
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,678
created and what comes out of those now

627
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,879
I feel like I've been going super

628
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,640
quickly and I did take a lot of dabs but

629
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
I also did want to stay focused and keep

630
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,720
this show focused on selecting a male

631
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,038
plant so I'm going to do a quick review

632
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,120
and then I think we're going to wrap up

633
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,158
this podcast cast and we're going to get

634
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,479
packed up so we can go see dead and Co

635
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,679
at the spere really quickly I think the

636
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,278
most important part is having a goal any

637
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,120
project if it's a breeding project a

638
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:11,558
building project uh even when you're

639
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,439
just driving somewhere you've got to

640
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,200
have a goal or you're not going to get

641
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
there so start off with the goal it

642
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,120
doesn't have to be a super crazy goal I

643
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,000
want to make seeds that look like plant

644
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,158
a and plant B together that could be

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,440
your goal but write that down so that

646
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,520
you've got a real goal in mind then I

647
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,000
recommend learning to make mental charts

648
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,879
alial charts learn about that stuff uh

649
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,519
like I said learn mental charts aliel

650
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,360
charts uh study all of the breeder books

651
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,278
you can learn about dominant traits

652
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,079
learn about co-dominant learn about Gene

653
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:43,798
transfer uh learn about recessive traits

654
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,079
learn about all of that stuff then when

655
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,599
it comes time to breeding uh forget

656
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,000
about all that and grow from your heart

657
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,359
breed with love and use intuition then

658
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,798
when it comes to selecting the male

659
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,839
plant um find the plant that reaches

660
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:58,158
your goal if that is possible or gets

661
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,399
you as close to your goal as possible

662
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,919
some with the uh shape and structure

663
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,679
that you're looking for the leaf size

664
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,278
and shape that you're looking for

665
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,640
something that grows well something that

666
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,720
flowers in the amount of time that

667
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,600
you're looking for find the plant that

668
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,600
suits your needs I'm telling you the

669
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,000
things that I like in a male plant but

670
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,759
you've got to find the one that suits

671
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,079
your needs I can get you pretty close

672
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,400
with ideas and descriptions but you've

673
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,798
got to find the dude that is for you

674
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,240
don't be discouraged if your first

675
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,918
breeding project doesn't give you the

676
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
outcome you want so find that male that

677
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,320
grows in the amount of time it's got the

678
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,278
sh the structure the leaf size the leaf

679
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,079
shape the colors um the big the big

680
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,558
flower structure that you're looking for

681
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,199
do you trellis your plants do you

682
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,759
manipulate them a lot do that to this

683
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,558
male plant see how he handles that keep

684
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,798
in mind that the male plant is going to

685
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,200
contribute heavily to the structure of

686
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,558
your progyny so select a male plant

687
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,440
that's got the shape and the structure

688
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,599
that you are looking for I know it's

689
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,640
hard to test a male plant for pathogen

690
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,798
resistance for pest resistance but if

691
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
you've got the opportunity definitely

692
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,519
subject that male to some abuse and see

693
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,679
how he responds uh give that plant like

694
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,720
I've said before some stress stress him

695
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,400
out a little bit uh drought him a little

696
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,400
bit drown him a little bit don't do both

697
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,720
back to back that may be a bit but give

698
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,519
them a little bit of stress give them

699
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,519
some drought stress overwater underfeed

700
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,200
overfeed see how it responds to all of

701
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,798
that because if you're like myself if

702
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,440
you're a commercial breeder you're going

703
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,440
to make those seeds and send them out to

704
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,798
people and then all of those Growers no

705
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,759
offense to you guys many of you are

706
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,000
learning you're going to overfeed them

707
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,720
you're going to underfeed them you're

708
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,960
going to give them drought conditions

709
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
you're going to put them in [ __ ] up

710
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,399
environments and I am okay with that

711
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,679
because you're a new grower and that's

712
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,678
what you're supposed to do but I breed

713
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,038
plants that I feel like are going to be

714
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,399
resistant to that and tolerant to that

715
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,558
if you're breeding in a room that gets

716
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,678
super hot and it's real humid in there

717
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,119
and it never gets a dry time uh grow

718
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,360
your male plants in there and find a

719
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,599
male plant that tolerates that super hot

720
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,199
room and tolerates that super super

721
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,759
humid area then you will find a plant

722
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,798
that works perfectly in your room and

723
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,398
The Offspring have already got a head

724
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,038
start that's a lot like a farmer that

725
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,239
has selected seeds outdoor over

726
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,759
generation over generation he's bred

727
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,599
them in his outdoor environment he's

728
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,319
made the right selections you were on

729
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,199
the same path doing the same thing

730
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,558
