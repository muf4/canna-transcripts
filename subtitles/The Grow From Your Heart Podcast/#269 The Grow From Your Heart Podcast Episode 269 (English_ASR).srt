little bit about my weekend ladies and

96
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,500
gentlemen I had a good friend blessed me

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,870
with a front row ticket to reggae on the

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,949
rocks if you've never been front row

99
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,470
right down the rocks that's a damn

100
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,849
experience go check that out it's

101
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,080
different it's way different well you

102
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,419
got to see let's go for it I just bought

103
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,310
my first concert tickets to Red Rocks

104
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:44,349
today actually are we gonna see I'm

105
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:45,819
gonna see gez on the 22nd Mike and I

106
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,379
were discussing earlier that how we're

107
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,839
in the way different music than a lot of

108
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,759
people Mike's like 10 years older than

109
00:04:49,839 --> 00:05:00,039
everybody he works with I probably I'm

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:05:01,539
the same age as Mike ten years well

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,460
that's funny because I had a front row

112
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,860
ticket and the headlining band was

113
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:08,019
Mike's favorite band which is 311 love

114
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:22,569
it I guess I went to 311 I stuck around

115
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:24,310
for one of the best venues in the

116
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,800
country I am the spoiled brat I've

117
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,750
probably seen 30 bread rocks concerts

118
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,740
and that's no joke probably 15 of them

119
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,930
were widespread panic

120
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:38,050
I was working that night and I caught a

121
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,538
couple I remember that you would

122
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,620
probably had just left a lot those

123
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:44,050
videos were being

124
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,459
yes so I get to see I get to see Morgan

125
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,810
heritage that's most the people that

126
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,099
listen to the podcast frequently know

127
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,470
that my favorite reggae band currently

128
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,790
it will change it does just my taste

129
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,500
change over here some that'll catch my

130
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,030
attention but Morgan heritage has been

131
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,750
my favorite reggae band for a couple a

132
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,269
few months here

133
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,050
probably the past year or so they were

134
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:03,759
awesome they played at 4:45 I got to

135
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,319
catch most of their set they sounded

136
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,670
fantastic they played a bunch of new

137
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,089
[ __ ] that I didn't know which was kind

138
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,129
of cool

139
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,509
I kind of wanted to hear some familiar

140
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,310
[ __ ] like you know you want to hear your

141
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,709
favorites but I also like seeing them

142
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,360
they do kind of a jam band thing they

143
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,680
start off with one song they don't stop

144
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,050
till about halfway through their said

145
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,040
they just segue song to song to song so

146
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,829
I was kind of neat to kind of did a

147
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,040
medley what's your favorite song by them

148
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:30,069
Joe it really depends on the mood that's

149
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,970
a good question right now like not like

150
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:36,279
this moment I'd probably throw on like

151
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,140
Jah seed is one of my favorite songs by

152
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,729
them but then strictly roots is also a

153
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,229
good one and then there's a bunch of

154
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:46,930
like remixes that they do put out a

155
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,650
single all the time but strictly roots

156
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,650
is a great one

157
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:52,269
so I got to see them they ended then I

158
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,219
was in the front row and I looked back

159
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,629
toward the sound booth just looking into

160
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,950
the crowd and I see one of the band

161
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,089
members hanging out I was like ah he's

162
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,920
over there I was like I'm not gonna go

163
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,509
bug him but he's right there and I

164
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,640
turned around and his brother Peter

165
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,099
Morgan was walking right past me and

166
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,389
Peter Morgan is probably my favorite

167
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,890
reggae singer if I could sound like

168
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,209
anybody if I could sing like a reggae

169
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,919
artist and probably be a Peter Morgan

170
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,060
you know that sounds really weird cuz

171
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,770
he's got a high-pitched kind of voice

172
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,660
he's kind of squeaky but then you could

173
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,639
[ __ ] sing and if I want if I could

174
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,920
sound like anybody probably beat him him

175
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,689
a Richie Spice but uh this is the kind

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,430
of reggae voice I wish I had I know I

177
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,660
don't but it's cool but that dude walked

178
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,819
right past me so I just put my hand on

179
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,930
his shoulder and that dude is beefy bro

180
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,370
like you know he touched some people

181
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,650
they kind of move that do did not move

182
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,939
he's one step [ __ ] Jamaican I put my

183
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,109
hand on his shoulder and I was like bro

184
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,310
thank you and he just turned around

185
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,780
looked me straight in my eyes and he

186
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,610
stood out his right hand he shoots my

187
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,109
hand and he said respect and then he

188
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,220
kept on walking cuz he didn't want to

189
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,449
get mobbed you know if I would have

190
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,070
stood there for three seconds he would

191
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,180
have got crowded so he just kept not

192
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,240
moving so that was cool I got to meet

193
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,069
pretty much my favorite reggae singer at

194
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,949
reggae on the rocks that was awesome so

195
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,649
he walked by time went on and then Steel

196
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,879
Pulse came on

197
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,829
Steel Pulse might be my number two

198
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:05,990
favorite reggae artist so it was great

199
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:08,509
seeing them I'm hit you guys was great

200
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,069
but they were a little slow everything

201
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,110
just seemed a touch slow they're getting

202
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:16,069
[ __ ] old like all the dreadlocks are

203
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,680
super gray in steel but they're getting

204
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,449
gray so shut it's my anonymous friend

cinnamon

241
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,399
I mean I could be wrong on that really

242
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,110
so don't call me I've never eaten it

243
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,360
because I'm a vegetarian I would assume

244
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,340
you have to like cuz I mean cooking it

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
in the oil wouldn't do enough because

246
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,879
you were ready to tell the dosage it's

247
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
real crispy and it's coated in something

248
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,269
because I he handed me someone gave it

249
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,430
to me but I just gave it to Bobo blaster

250
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,929
Co because I don't need bacon when I

251
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:21,759
told him that I'm a vegetarian

252
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,500
he kind of looked at me and he felt bad

253
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,779
that he had been offering me bacon he

254
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,370
felt like legitimately guilty like [ __ ]

255
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:33,069

because of her so cuz I know she

271
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,220
wouldn't represent a place that wasn't

272
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,330
uh wasn't worth representing she's got

273
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,830
too big of a heart so shout it's

place I saw that was a place called

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,049
pride in medicine in Denver but they

282
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,639
fell off on all the new rules came

283
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,439
different places doing something similar

284

328
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,458
pick a streak whatever I'm doing I'm

329
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,139
really stubborn so if I commit to

330
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,309
something then I just like to once I

331
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,198
made it like a week or two and I've

332
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,638
broken the desire or whatever then I'm

333
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,019
like it's easy let's just see how long I

334
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,120
can go on whatever I'm doing here

335
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,799
whether it's not eating meat which has

336
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
been 20-something years now or not

337
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:54,838
brushing my hair which has been almost

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:15:12,528
12 years or nice and close you got

339
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:15,600
almost you almost brush your beard I

340
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:19,649
just felt like trying so they come to

341
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,940

342

you brought there the tiramisu one there

345
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:28,649
I had a bunch of people asked before and

346
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,100
that's the one I plan on trying but you

347
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,480
know how I act for lemon G dad's she

348

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,620
animals the packaging is impressive as

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,688
[ __ ] they're totally compliant with the

351
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,039
new rules - which I like is a lot of

352
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:45,789
stuff but I'm even that I'm getting

353
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,949
samples of right now is a packaging yeah

354
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:51,000
I think they knew that that was coming

355
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:54,310
just they just planned really get yeah

356
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,289
and I I mean I haven't tried one yet but

357
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:58,000
so far packaging and presentations at

358
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,799
home run remember back in the day when

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
we had a dispensary and the packaging

360
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:12,699
was basically one of these Ziploc bags

361
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:15,370
with the product we would get the

362
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,890
owner's owner one of the owners were

363
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,570
walking in with a laundry or not you

364
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,549
know like the sweater storage bin the

365
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,890
big plastic bin for like under the bed

366
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:25,569
was one of those Tupperware things he

367
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:30,909
made a lot of people make an easy cloner

368
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:33,220
out of it would be full of like slices

369
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:35,079
of banana bread individually wrapped in

370
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,509
ziplock bags with just a piece of scotch

371
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,360
tape taping the flap down so it fit Todd

372
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:43,720
and that was what went onto our shelves

373
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,039
like yeah it was exactly that and you

374
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:54,370
know they stayed when we closed at the

375
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:56,500
end of the night advanced where we are

376
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,240
now because it's a good thing that the

377
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,649
health department is overseeing edible

378
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,299
production but I do I never pictured

379
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,059
something like the product I'm holding

380
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:09,399
in my hand I mean even three years ago

381
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,539
let alone five or seven that's like

382
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,030
something that you would get from a

383
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:16,649
really fine hot chocolate company

384
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:16,649
through the mail or something like

[Music]

386
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:34,839
that's probably just somebody making it

387
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:37,200
up but I've paid a lot of money to give

388
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:41,199
these two girlfriends throughout my life

389
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,120
just not medicated I've paid the same

390
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,980
amount for these that I paid for

391
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,589
unmedicated chocolates more than one

392
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,579
holiday let's go let's give a quick

393

folks is probably well into your day to

427
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,280
myself I bet this conversation happened

428
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:11,990
at one still had an am attached to it

[Music]

430
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,130
and he's like hey ah this is what's up

431
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:18,690
this reporter is looking for somebody to

432
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,120
talk to because there's this news story

433
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,490
going on and he's like would you like to

434
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,869
speak and I was like new and about two

435
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,250
seconds later my phone blew up with a

436
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,329
whole bunch of other people asking me

437
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,250
would you like to speak for us would you

438
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,480
like to speak for us cuz I'm well-spoken

439
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,558
I guess I'm well-known amongst the

440
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,669
cannabis community and they felt that

441
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,869
I'd be a good representative so Sean

442
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,460
it's all the people that message me and

443
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,089
wanted me to contact this reporter for

444
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,579
you that's cool

445
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:40,918
I passed the baton over to our buddy

446
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,720
Mike because I don't want to be on the

447
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,090
news talking about that I grow cannabis

448
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,769
I just don't want to do that so I let

449
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:49,849
Mike do it and Mike's well-spoken and

450
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:52,980
eloquent and well there's a reason

451
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:55,199
caregivers don't do interviews yeah it's

452
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,409
really good Markowitz effect

453
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,970
I just want to name it on the show the

454
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,620
Berkowitz effect the one and only

455
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,410
caregiver in Colorado to really do an

456
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,079
interview

457
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,710
paid for it severely yeah is still

458
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:12,579
paying for didn't in many very real ways

459
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:14,559
and it's been a lot of years in in

460
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:17,399
pueblos that means that we had no

461
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,259
caregiver advocates down here as sort of

462
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,680
for lack of a better candidate that

463
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:25,119
became me a long time ago thank you

464
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,310
you're welcome it's a fight that I care

465
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,909
about caregivers have been part of

466
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:34,000
Colorado for more than a decade we've

467
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,620
never been part of the problem and I say

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,579
we in a very general term because I am

469
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:41,199
NOT a caregiver but right now in

470
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:44,230
Colorado from a number of different

471
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,970
angles people they're going after the

472
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,670
doctors right now and looking at plant

473
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,529
counts there every County is restricting

474
00:22:48,670 --> 00:23:00,100
the number of plants you can grow in a

475
00:22:50,529 --> 00:23:02,379
home garden for directly

476
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:04,059
it's a rough time I predicted a couple

477
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,310
of years back that caregiving wouldn't

478
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,869
be a thing by 2020 we saw this happen in

479
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,279
Springs less than a year ago and now

480
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,979
that's basically the same rules are

481
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,200
trying to implement Springs are trying

482
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,990
to be here it's it's even more than that

483
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,940
they've already done it here and what

484
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,099
their what the what's going on right now

485
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,680
is our Board of County Commissioners is

486
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,679
talking about putting a question on the

487
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,320
vote this November on the ballot that

488
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:33,100
says should we go to the state and

489
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:38,589
continue to lobby for a statewide cap of

490
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:40,689
18 plants per house even even if you

491
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:42,730
have a medical recommendation from your

492
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,990
doctor to grow an increased plant count

493
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,610
of say sixty plants the didn't [ __ ] your

494
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,890
medical card [ __ ] your needs [ __ ] your

495
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:55,809
condition the new rules that they're

496
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,910
talking about wouldn't affect the card

497
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,159
that you get written it would just

498
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:03,460
affect your ability to grow on that card

499
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,220
okay you'd be limited to that number of

500
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,460
plants unless you had a specific type of

501
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,960
property which I haven't just seem to

502
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,298
find anywhere it's just not in a house

503
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,399
or

504
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:14,569
residents and because of what caregivers

505
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,998
are and what the other rules around

506
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,769
caregiving are in Colorado that means

507
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,470
you can't be a caregiver and have more

508
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:23,210
than 18 planets period because of your

509
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,618
caregiver you can't have a storefront or

510
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,798
a building or anything like that you

511
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:29,988
have to do that Bureau so essentially

512
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,989
these new rules statewide means no more

513
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:34,819
caregivers and your extended plant count

514
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:36,679
card could still exist and you just be

515
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:39,349
excited assigning that extended plant

516
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,610
count to your dispensary which feels

517
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,230
like is what they're trying to do with

518
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,579
most of the patients are trying to take

519
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,929
away the caregiver and send it all to a

520
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:46,220
dispensary so they can make some tax

521
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,528
money off of it and not worry about

522
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,569
what's actually needing to be taken care

523
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,440
of that's been the goal statewide for a

524
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,918
long time

525
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,109
caregivers have been the scapegoat for

526
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,009
all continued black market activity in

527
00:24:57,108 --> 00:25:02,658
Colorado for the last eight years

528
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,429
anytime a home girl gets busted they're

529
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,340
like oh my god these medical rules are

530
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,950
so confusing and I go back and reread

531
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,798
the article in the paper and it's there

532
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:15,019
was no paperwork it wasn't a caregiver

533
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,999
that was breaking the rules or

534
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,710
manipulating the rules or hiding under

535
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:20,239
the rules it was just a black market

536
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,509
grower that's been here for forever

537
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:24,919
doing what they've always done the only

538
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:27,368
thing that's different is that

539
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,379
caregivers also exist in the same state

540
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:33,349
but caregivers are the public face of

541
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:37,038
home growing and so they take all that

542
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:39,339
heat at the same time the state has got

543
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,528
the taste of recreational taxes and

544
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:45,738
they've gotten a real look at the sales

545
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:47,480
totals by volume in the Med markets

546
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:51,710
still eating up half of what Colorado

547
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,009
period is selling and they would love to

548
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,690
tax that at the higher rate so medicals

549
00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:00,139
kinda under attack under all fronts

550
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:03,429
right now which is why telling people to

551
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:03,428
register to vote for eight months

552
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,130
something then you can clear up for a

553
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,079
lot of Colorado folks people in Colorado

554
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,460
have this thing that they think this

555
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,019
since as an adult they're allowed to

556
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,420
grow six plants if they get their basic

557
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,700
six plow plant medical marijuana card

558
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,259
are you allowed to grow your 6 + or 6 or

559
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,690
are you just limited at the original six

560
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:24,299
it depends on where you're living that

561
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,630
is confusing a [ __ ] it really really

562
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:31,200
really really ok so here in Pueblo it

563
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,900
matters city to County the city doesn't

564
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,080
care what your plant count is I work

565
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,480
incredibly hard for a very long time to

566
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:43,279
make sure that the city of Pueblo did

567
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,289
not implement a plant count limit just

568
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,059
we found sympathetic ears inside city

569
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:51,180
government and myself and a caregiver

570
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:52,950
here in town who isn't willing to go on

571
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,070
the news but is willing to work with

572
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,990
city government people managed to get

573
00:26:56,069 --> 00:27:00,329
them to hear reason and not do a plant

574
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,630
can't live it so they just where footage

575
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:05,099
limit and require air filtration we

576
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,040
couldn't get them to hear reason on a

577
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:12,119
number of other rules implemented that I

578
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,430
don't support nearly as much but in the

579
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,829
county they've already passed an 18

580
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:20,130
plant count limit which means if you

581
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:22,919
live in Pueblo County versus City you're

582
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,110
limited 18 plants period if you live in

583
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,880
a residential area there are some

584
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:30,240
exceptions to that and you'll have to

585
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,550
look up your specific zoning your

586
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,259
residence and then what the specific

587
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:36,839
rules are for that zoning designation

588
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:45,930
but before I could give you a hard

589
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:47,179
answer on that me that Pablo was an 18

590
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,960
count

591
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,330
County and I was like what are you

592
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,370
talking about I was like no it's not

593
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,369
Lina's like yeah it is

594
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:05,689
I I remember that fight and there was

595
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:08,100
not much public support against it

596
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,380
carriers for really busy people the

597
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,839
state put the squeeze on them several

598
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,900
years ago with a couple of statewide

599
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,339
limitations that mean in practice

600
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,000
caregivers don't have a lot of free time

601
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:23,480
to lobby City Council's and when they do

602
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,829
they tend to get treated pretty badly

603
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,929
because they're there for one specific

604
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,879
issue they don't have six months to

605
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:33,048
learn how to play the insane game you're

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,820
required to play to do things like that

607
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:38,329
it's often unfortunate that the system

608
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,339
works that way but that's how it works

609
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:43,379
and so caregivers have had a rough go of

610
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,439
it in Colorado and it looks like one

611
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,850
maybe two more elections and they're

612
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,330
gonna be something that's in our history

613
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:51,029
books

614
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:52,769
we need caregivers so if you can really

615
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,329
do if you're a part of the vote make

616
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,069
sure that you wait for this to come up

617
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:58,970
on the ballot and you do not allow them

618
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:01,798
to limit our plank count to 18 plants

619
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,650
just as an example if you've got a four

620
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:07,230
by four train you've got one light it is

621
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:10,320
very feasible it makes a lot of sense to

622
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,548
run 64 plants in that 4x4 train that

623
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,240
sounds like a lot of plants right but

624
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:14,970
here's how you do it

625
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,769
you cut 64 clones as soon as they start

626
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,720
popping fat roots you put them in the

627
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:21,240
4x4 tray you put a little capillary mat

628
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,039
down for those roots to grow into you do

629
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,569
it's like a an ebb and flow system you

630
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,129
fill that tray then you drain that tray

631
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,609
every hour fill it drain it fill it

632
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,410
drain it

633
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:29,969
you got 64 little plants and there you

634
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,410
flower them they're about six inches

635
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,940
tall they finish off about twelve inches

636
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,890
tall and you pull about six or seven

637
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,259
grams for a plant that's a pound of weed

638
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,940
but you got sixty-four plants you do the

639
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,440
same thing with one plant or four plants

640
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,120
under seven gallon pot just depending on

641
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,519
how long you want to veg it it takes a

642
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:46,289
lot longer it's way easier to pull that

643
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,470
pound of cannabis for Mike's medicine

644
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:50,879
with 64 tiny tiny plants than it is with

645
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,500
a whole bunch of big pots and bigger

646
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
plants that you have to veg for a longer

647
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,308
time so it makes a lot of sense it's not

648
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,720
like sixty-four plants is not like

649
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:59,970
cartel numbers kicking out although

650
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,690
that's way that's one pound just one

651
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,519
example

652
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,529
I mean people when they see something

653
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,049
like ninety nine plants is the state

654
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,730
limit they picture

655
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:11,099
plants they've seen in the newspaper

656
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,009
that are the size of a Volkswagen bus

657
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:16,769
[Music]

658
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:18,539
the end they just don't realize that

659
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:20,369
immediately the numbers cut in half

660
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,889
because only half of those planets can

661
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:24,809
be flowering right when you're talking

662
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,580
about a caregiver with that's growing

663
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:31,129
ninety nine plants it's often because

664
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:34,549
their caregivers four or five patients

665
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:38,010
often five patients and then themselves

666
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:40,200
and each patient requires two or three

667
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:43,379
strands each strain requires one or two

668
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,750
moms when you start dividing out over

669
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,340
life cycles in two different rooms all

670
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,250
of a sudden you're you're just

671
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,589
struggling to stay under 99 and you're

672
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,420
barely producing enough marijuana for

673
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:56,069
just your patients and if you want to

674
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,019
run a seed pack to find something new

675
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,639
then you're really already over numbers

676
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,529
so you can pop those ten and get them

677
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,300
planned it gets very complicated and

678
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:08,069
when you're number six it's it's almost

679
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:12,450
impossible you you're basically left

680
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:15,720
with plant a seed pray it's female maybe

681
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:18,690
keep one and rotate five I mean it gets

682
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,470
very complicated quickly and it's not

683
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:25,529
productive and it doesn't do anything to

684
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,750
combat the things that people that are

685
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,099
writing these rules are hoping it will

686
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,710
it's not gonna do anything to the

687
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,779
illegal growers it's not gonna do

688
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,759
anything to the smell of marijuana in

689
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,629
neighborhoods bullshitty gross with no

690
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,279
carbon filters it's just gonna make life

691
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,320
a lot harder for patients who rely on

692
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,920
caregivers for medicine at a price they

693
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,210
can afford

694
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,950
it's gonna force them to go to a

695
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,500
dispensary it's gonna force them to

696
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,630
maybe find a ride they don't have a ride

697
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,750
maybe they don't have time maybe they

698
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,670
don't have money because I know that

699
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,500
what if you've got a caregiver what you

700
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,120
are reimbursing your caregiver compared

701
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,390
to what you are paying at the dispensary

702
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:07,500
is a huge huge drastic difference the

703
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:10,080
difference is massive almost 50% yeah

704
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,130
the I mean just the cost to the the

705
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,939
patient is 50% at least so here's

706
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,500
something that we should think about

707
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,400
Mike I've been your caregiver for how

708
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,359
long now since probably 2010

709
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,160
give or take so six or seven years I

710
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,019
know your cannabis needs very well I

711
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,480
like to think I've watched you evolve

712
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:31,930
into a little dabber lately I need to

713
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,640
see it I can name straight I know which

714
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,840
strains you like I know if I walked into

715
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,160
my garden I'd be like I gotta throw a

716
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,019
couple of these into the room for Mike

717
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,810
because he's gonna need this in about 60

718
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,109
days I gotta get this ready for him

719
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:46,599
Lindsay's a budtender she's a very good

720
00:32:43,109 --> 00:33:23,469
she knows you but how much do you know

721
00:32:46,599 --> 00:33:26,429
about Mike's but that's exactly what I

722
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:29,700
needed to do for me in the evenings but

723
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,600
we're wandering caregivers are important

724
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,250
my point is that I know what Mike needs

725
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,199
I've got flowers pretty much prepared

726
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,670
when Mike needs them I know like Oh

727
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,830
should I better put that into flour soon

728
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,269
cuz my got this from me a little bit ago

729
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:44,500
you got this that means pretty soon as

730
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:46,420
jars gonna be empty is gonna be like

731
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,470
where's my grateful dog bro and I'm

732
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,269
gonna need to have something that ready

733
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,769
for him and no offense to you you're not

734
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,690
supposed to know that but you don't know

735
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:54,160
that [ __ ] you're the you're gonna be the

736
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,930
one providing his cannabis if they

737
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,850
eliminate me from the chain and you're

738
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,170
gonna have to learn all of these people

739
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,189
that do not have a caregiver anymore

740
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,660
you're gonna have to try to learn their

741
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,549
medicine you have to try to have that

742
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,560
product on the shelf can they grow it

743
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,930
green and healthy wellness supply those

744
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,090
flowers that Mike needs the juicy needs

745
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,530
that I need that you need if people in

746
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,879
that room need people in that house over

747
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,649
there need can we [ __ ] supply those

748
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,049
specific flowers like a caregiver can

749
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:18,849
know is they don't have that many mother

750
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,620
plants and they don't have the time the

751
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,869
part of the equation that really worries

752
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:26,619
me isn't really the part that affects me

753
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,719
directly um a lot of the people that use

754
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,059
the caregiver system in Colorado are

755
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,299
consuming

756
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:36,929
if amounts of THC concentrated oil and

757
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,610
CBD concentrated oil and in the medical

758
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,359
or the rec market this is gonna cost

759
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:44,390
them hundreds of dollars a day per dose

760
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,900
when you price it out recreational

761
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:51,359
several hundred dollars a day per dose

762
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:54,800
two doses a day so you're looking at

763
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:58,170
twelve thirteen hundred per day in

764
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,810
medication and in the caregiver market

765
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,820
with the plant counts that are under

766
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:09,420
attack right now they're getting that

767
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:11,330
same dose at the same quality if not

768
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,829
better depending on the production and

769
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:20,190
it a far cheaper price pennies on the

770
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:22,799
dollar because of how its produced and

771
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,800
where it's produced they didn't need the

772
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,539
million dollar machine the two million

773
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,940
dollar building the hundred thousand

774
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:32,159
dollars in permits and so they don't

775
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,280
have to pass that on to the epilepsy

776
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,170
patients into the cancer patients that

777
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,050
are taking a thousand milligrams of CBD

778
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,280
twice a day or a thousand milligrams of

779
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,370
THC twice a day

780
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,870
I had a caregiver give me a bottle that

781
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,239
was I think six hundred and forty eight

782
00:35:45,869 --> 00:36:01,650
milligrams of pure THC what would that

783
00:35:48,239 --> 00:36:04,229
cost me at a recreational 648 rec you're

784
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:09,450
looking at around sixty to ninety eight

785
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:16,429
gram for good for good like co2 oil if

786
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:19,559
it was pure CBD teacher oil and THC I

787
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:23,940
mean you're still looking at maybe 300

788
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:28,019
bucks okay I exchanged a ten pack of

789
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:30,179
seeds for that teacher because it was a

790
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,610
caregiver to caregiver transaction for a

791
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,829
child

792
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,519
I mean recreationally that would have

793
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:40,309
cost a fortune

794
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:43,130
yeah you prefer 160 milligrams you

795
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:44,360
in it I mean like 60 would have given it

796
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,829
to me if I didn't even offer him the

797
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,269
seed pack in exchange right I was like

798
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,039
you get something you know like there

799
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,960
was stuff here so you get stuff for my

800
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,820
stuff it's how it works I mean the

801
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,760
caregiver system is where the people

802
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,460
that really really need the in high

803
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,580
quality high dose medicines that's where

804
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,170
they get their their product if I have

805
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:05,960
to I can deal with the recreational

806
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,940
market I've got a job I've got access to

807
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,500
enough cannabis product selection to

808
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,200
keep myself on my feet and healthy

809
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,480
enough to work but there are a lot of

810
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,609
people who can't say that in Colorado

811
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,590
that rely on caregivers and that's why I

812
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:25,690
don't mind standing up and doing even

813
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,690
though I'm not I definitely appreciate

814
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,639

00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:57,859
the porn shop for some people they just

817
00:37:51,110 --> 00:38:26,960
can't be seen doing that the porn shop

818
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:29,320
or the dispensary there's definitely a

819
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,050
stigma attached for a lot of people I

820
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,750
still run into irregularly I run into

821
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,550
customers who are from other states who

822
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,010
are like I can't use the ATM in this

823
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,900
building yeah because my bank might know

824
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,420
that this address is where a pot store

825
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,780
also is

826
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:52,389
or that paranoia yeah I mean like a

827
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:54,710
handful a day I'm it's not rare because

828
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:56,629
large parts of the rest of the country

829
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,510
doing what we're doing while we're

830
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,309
talking about it this table will late

831
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,270
your ass in jail for an incredibly long

832
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,159
period of time

833
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,980
um these delicious chocolates we were

834
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:36,259
just eating are like a serious felony in

835
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:44,869
some parts of the US because a little

836
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:51,110
more okay I told the cop so I'll use

837
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:52,389
those for [ __ ] stains I'm on work I said

838
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:57,320
in court too by the way

839
00:39:52,389 --> 00:40:00,519
it's really embarrassing forty forty

840
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,500
five days of my life was taken away

841
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:06,409
rolling rolling papers man I remember

842
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,380
those days though when when I was in

843
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:11,389
band in like seventh grade they told us

844
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,680
to buy rolling papers for something I

845
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:14,599
don't even remember what about the

846
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,309
instruments but the paper specifically

847
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:22,400
was good for something with the rack you

848
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:23,929
read it yeah but I remember the speech

849
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,010
in class they're like alright what

850
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:27,769
you're buying now is currently

851
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,840
contraband if law enforcement contacts

852
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:32,539
you about these you can explain that

853
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,160
it's for your instrument and hopefully

854
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:36,139
you don't get a ticket for having what

855
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,000
we're telling you to have and that was

856
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:40,920
like 20 years ago and there's still

857
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,360
places in the country that I like that

858
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,389
[Music]

859

mean

861
00:40:47,969 --> 00:41:13,349
and I went back about a year ago I don't

862
00:40:51,059 --> 00:41:14,730
have a paranoid feeling a little bit in

863
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:19,069
the corner you like [ __ ] I'm going to

864

I'm glad you reached out to me you said

869

[Music]

871
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:53,519
the ones so you just drop these straight

872
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,710
into your drink and it dissolves and

873
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,460
then you drink it that's the brand new

874
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,809
price we don't have the the brand newest

875
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,240
scent on our shelves yeah just the

876
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:06,659
strattice pills ah I was pretty damn

877
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:14,639
cool they're uh brand new product on the

878
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:17,219
market last what six months everywhere

879
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,409
across the six months ago

880
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,599
I really liked them personally they're

881
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:23,519
they're a great low-dose medication

882
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,569
option their their CBD products are

883
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:33,030
really convenient and they're available

884
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:36,390
recreationally milligrams and three

885
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:39,150
different kinds the relax is like a it's

886
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:53,699
a hybrid the energies the sativa and

887
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:55,769
then we have also one asleep the sleep I

888
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:58,829
get more feedback is it just had a real

889
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:02,659
heavily activated THC a yeah okay that

890
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,659
makes sense that makes no sense and

891
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,769
[Music]

892
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:17,039
we decided that was not safe around

893
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:33,930
[Applause]

894
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:33,929
[Music]

895
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:54,819
[Music]

896
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:57,429
there's not mild flavor yes nice a lot

897
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,590
of drinks have a heavy flavor so an

898
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:01,269
option that I can a medicate whatever

899
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:04,930
beverage I want without adding tincture

900
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:07,059
which is always a little weird I do like

901
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:20,099
this sodas but you can taste that

902
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:28,599
medicine you know the flowers just need

903
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:30,639
THC in there I was like damn Jeff's

904
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,079
gonna call me out on this but like man

905
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,759
Brett really had it right in the last

906
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:39,699
one when he did like the stretches in

907
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,740
the middle he kills it on Facebook

908
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:44,019
Brennan or on Instagram post the

909
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:47,379
greatest [ __ ] on Instagram Sheva Seva

910
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:48,670
labs at Mary's you know he has a fake so

911
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,130
make sure you follow the right one

912
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,950
Mary's motivation yeah show to the

913
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,720
correct Mary's motivation he's only got

914
00:44:53,949 --> 00:45:05,319
two post-its the fake one don't follow

915
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:07,000
him so you're a courier and you get to

916
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,130
go to probably almost half of the

917
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,179
dispensaries in the state what's that

918
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:15,640
like we had an episode variety medical

919
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:17,440
and recreation

920
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:20,139
part of that makes me real jealous it's

921
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,730
a gorgeous state and I would love to

922
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:23,980
spend part of my day everyday driving

923
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:45,039
around it but after a while keep in mind

924
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:51,699
it's September now social media feeds

925
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:53,469

00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:54,789
listener so you probably listen to we

927
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:57,159
talked about the craziest [ __ ] that

928
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:58,630
people have seen in a dispensary going

929
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:03,369
to all these dispensaries I'm sure

930
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:04,690
you've seen something crazy something

931
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,859
that stands out something that you'd

932
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,329
want to share with a bunch of people

933
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,099
that listen on a podcast anything you've

934
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:11,199
seen either at a dispensary or at like a

935
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,150
smoke lounge or a smoke event but for

936
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:24,879
craziness you've seen at an industry

937
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:27,340

00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,339
a great stream I know a dude that drew

945
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,519
that for several years

946
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,930
yeah I'm looking at looking I'm at the

947
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:54,420
end of the table guys and I'm looking

948
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:58,449
down the table and I see at least eight

949
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,849
mainstream cannabis companies I mean

950
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:03,039
different companies products vastly

951
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:06,219
different types of products yeah and

952
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,769
just this afternoon I was reading an

953
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:13,449
article that was saying Colorado doesn't

954
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:14,860
have real legalization it hurts there

955
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:17,669
there are people that are gonna vote

956
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,980
against legalization this November

957
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:23,320
because they're worried they won't make

958
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,059
enough money when their state ends up

959
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,669
exactly like Colorado isn't

960
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:29,949
it's insane I can't believe you to vote

961
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:32,768
to risk going to jail and keeping it the

962
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:41,918
way it is because of something silly

963
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:44,708
like that I was a black market grower

964
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:46,658
for far too long and it's much more

965
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:48,188
comfortable having shifted to having

966
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:52,409
this badge around my neck all the time

967
00:47:48,188 --> 00:47:54,338
and knowing that what I'm doing is not

968
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:55,659
something I'm on a camera you could

969
00:47:54,338 --> 00:48:32,739
watch me all day this is what I'm doing

970
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:34,829
I was so much easier that way but the

971
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:38,108
Olympics is running so fast

972
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:39,369
so you know sorry altitude we didn't

973
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:49,538
mean to just completely bash your

974
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:52,380
pre-roll at a concert you're like I'm

975
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:52,380
gonna fire up this joint

976
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:58,110
I gotta light the other side and then

977
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:58,109
that part falls apart like this one just

978
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:09,940
[Music]

979
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:21,279

security guard lady was a prison guard

1002
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:08,290

1010
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,340
really started looking at security and

1011
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:36,549
making some improvements inside it's a

1012
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:39,550
completely my first Red Rock show I

1013
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:42,280
think was fish in ninety five six nine

1014
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:44,230
ninety five saw fish there and it was

1015
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,780
basically a hard to judge of any of

1016
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:49,130
security from the night fish play my

1017
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,810
client

1018
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,910
it was it was a giant dirt field it was

1019
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:55,650
a giant dirt and cactus and [ __ ]

1020
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:57,809
brush fire waiting to happen type of

1021
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,349
field and if we're a hippie wearing

1022
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:04,230
sandals

1023
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:12,170
it was just I remember it wasn't just a

1024
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:12,170
concert it was an adventure up hill I

1025
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:17,549
[Music]

1026
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,140
kind of challenged myself a little bit I

1027
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:22,230
was like I'm gonna do this [ __ ] let's go

1028
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:23,940
and I did well I I can control my

1029
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,800
breathing quite well and I've got

1030
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,389
[ __ ] these climber legs because I'm

1031
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,740
so tall I got a lot of leverage so I

1032
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:37,049
just go up that hill all day [ __ ]

1033
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:40,289
long a little bit before I get to my

1034
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:42,480
seat a lot shorts a t-shirt a

1035
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:52,469
long-sleeve shirt a rain poncho a bottle

1036
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:53,789
of water for fish I 95 but I ate so much

1037
00:51:52,469 --> 00:52:03,719
acid that I didn't know where I was

1038
00:51:53,789 --> 00:52:07,139
anymore so it didn't matter Red Rocks

1039
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,939
looks like it looks like a state park it

1040
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,980
looks it's really cleaned it's cement

1041
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,320
it's all cemented everywhere a lot of

1042
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,630
the parking is now submit it's not used

1043
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,490
to be a 95 it's completely different in

1044
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,230
96 I snuck over the back of the stage

1045
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:21,719
and watch the Allman Brothers Band from

1046
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,760
the rocks behind the stage for free this

1047
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:25,469
year I saw somebody up there and I'm 99%

1048
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,820
sure security [ __ ] climbed up there

1049
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:29,279
and arrested those [ __ ] and

1050
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,720
they got like if $10,000 ticket so you

1051
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,550
can't do that [ __ ] anymore Red Rocks has

1052
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:50,429

1055
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:57,199

00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,740
right here but there's a laundromat

1084
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:28,710
two weeks ago she was you know happy

1085
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:34,949
birthday was her birthday and we went to

1086
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:44,730
this place and this guy comes out of

1087
00:55:34,949 --> 00:57:59,369
there I don't know and just blew my mind

1088
00:55:44,730 --> 00:58:00,659
there was nobody in the product I've met

1089
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:03,900
people do that before that either just

1090
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:09,480
not directly on a backward or are used

1091
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:11,610
as chewing tobacco people that I grew up

1092
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,690
in tobacco farm land that's where I'm

1093
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:16,440
from Pretoria so you know that was kind

1094
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,659
of normal

1095
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,389
you know I mean he I'm sure he grew he

1096
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:22,949
raised to back my mama sit there tell me

1097

how she used to pick it was just five

1098
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:31,289
years old that's so bad yeah I'm sure

1099
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,870
he's probably just through a whole bleep

1100
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:35,849
in his mouth yeah it's pretty rugged I

1101
00:58:33,869 --> 00:58:37,710
get really lit up when I smoke blunts

1102
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:39,569
something about that tobacco leaf just

1103
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:41,780
really makes me spin around and get sore

1104
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,780
yeah

1105
00:58:43,019 --> 00:59:08,940

00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:51,840
ask me for or asked me if we carry them

1116
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:54,029
and so I just grabbed both both kinds

1117
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,160
that we carried and brought them for fun

1118
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:58,620
dive in did you try that monkey right uh

1120
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:01,679
don't pay me to say this at all but that

1121
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,120
monkey bar from Incredibles is one of my

1122
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:14,069
very favorite edibles that's ever been

1123
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:17,489
made how much did you eat so yeah this

1124
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:19,980
is this is this is why I hit this twice

1125
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:21,849
within a 12 hour period I consumed over

1126
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:26,199
2,500 milligrams of edibles

1127
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:26,199
[Music]

1128
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:33,009
[Music]

1129
01:00:34,460 --> 01:02:13,230
that was when I was going in but any

1130
01:01:06,389 --> 01:02:15,389
more than that and I'm like because I

1131
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:18,750
can sit there and pop six of them and

1132
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:22,650
have that is like I'm really toasted

1133
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:24,510
dose and I actually - like - and enjoy

1134
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,220
the edible most of my graph of edibles

1135
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:29,400
is they're delicious but now they're the

1136
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,348
size like some joint and you take one

1137
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,630
tiny little brownie bite in like I'm a

1138
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:35,550
big guy when I take a tiny bite of a

1139
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,140
brownie most of the rest of my

1140
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,000
body that's not chewing in that moment

1141
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:42,119
starts looking for more that [ __ ]

1142
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,019
browning and when all of the brownie has

1143
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:47,489
weeded it back in get dangerous fast but

1144
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:49,259
yeah that's why I like this is the lower

1145
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:51,059
dose stuff because I can have a couple

1146
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,680
pieces and enjoy because most of them

1147
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,409
are insanely good now I've got a new

1148
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:56,940
idea for an edible company what's sell

1149
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:58,170
let's just copy our favorite edibles and

1150
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,730
we'll sell those and then right

1151
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:02,280
alongside those will sell the same thing

1152
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:18,750
without any THC in it it's people have

1153
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:20,730
been joking about it there's more than

1154
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,440
one company that does a larger piece

1155
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,860
they just don't do it in a multi pack

1156
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:28,230
successfully they need to make like a

1157
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:30,390
dozen of cookies right and they need to

1158
01:03:28,230 --> 01:04:04,740
have one packaged in the front of it and

1159
01:03:30,389 --> 01:04:06,329
that one is edible and I passed it on

1160
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:07,649
and they looked completely offended I

1161
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:09,299
was like sorry I'm on a thing and they

1162
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:10,470
just that's cool but I mean what the

1163
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:20,070
[ __ ] why'd you give it away and so they

1164
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:22,939
giving it back oh I forgot sorry I'm not

1165
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,940
doing those strokes anymore

1166
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:33,078
I'll do it again

1167
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:34,759
it's just I'm I'm just stubborn it's

1168
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,289
funny it's more of a joke to me now that

1169
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:37,699
I haven't done eating any edible since

1170
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:40,219
that time it's secret Szechuan I ate

1171
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:41,619
like 2,500 milligrams and then I tried

1172
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:46,099
to go to work

1173
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:47,959
always and I swear to God every time we

1174
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:49,880
have the conversation like we're not

1175
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:51,618
gonna eat edibles like the last two

1176
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,199
times you followed through on that

1177
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:59,719
obviously the last two times I have not

1178
01:04:54,199 --> 01:05:03,019
it was 9:30 at secret stash and Chris

1179
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:05,559
bought me a cookie I was gonna bring

1180
01:05:03,018 --> 01:05:09,078
this out I'm like eating the cookies

1181
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:11,390
open shop the next day and the guy was

1182
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:14,089
like I'm eating it and he's like yeah

1183
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:15,170
these cookies were like 300 milligrams

1184
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:17,239
that's what I've been telling everybody

1185
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:21,409
he's like but realistically they might

1186
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:28,670
be like I was like I'm 3/4 is cooking

1187
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:29,808
I'm like but like man I wish I would

1188
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:32,079
have known that before I started eating

1189
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:34,459
it I would have only eaten a quarter or

1190
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,079
one of the things I like about the rec

1191
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:40,098
market over the Med and there's not a

1192
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:42,170
lot on that list but the dosing in the

1193
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:43,759
lab testing them to perfection it's

1194
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,159
coming to the medical scene variance

1195
01:05:43,759 --> 01:05:48,858
it'll be there

1196
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,808
less than a year probably but I heard

1197
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:52,548
November I was supposed to be July and

1198
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:57,019
then they said November so we have to

1199
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:58,309
built the labs yeah bring creating this

1200
01:05:57,018 --> 01:06:00,169
from the ground up which is like why

1201
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:04,249
we're joking about like different models

1202
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:07,329
for edible companies if we're really

1203
01:06:04,248 --> 01:06:10,909
watching it's fun I had the honor of

1204
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:12,829
giving Lindsey and her better half mr.

1211
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:39,290
podcast and then we were all smoking and

1212
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:41,900
I guess I had said I was gonna wait to

1213
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:43,730
do a damn and I've said no I don't want

1214
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,619
to Chris thought I said that I was gonna

1215
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,510
wait so apparently we're all waiting for

1216
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:49,250
me to take it down I fell asleep in the

1217
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,360
back of the car and then I woke up and I

1218
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,210
was like all right I'm gonna keep eating

1219
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,530
so that I will stay awake and then Chris

01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:15,559
I knew his name until right now

1498
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:18,110

then Jeff Tate went on he did a comedy

1501
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:23,658
set and then toward the end of his

1502
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:26,089
stand-up routine he said I'm going to

1503
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:27,618
light this joint and start smoking and

1504
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:30,199
at some point in this comedy show I'm

1505
01:28:27,618 --> 01:28:32,598
going to become too high just continue

1506
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:34,759
doing stand-up and so he lit his joint

1507
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:36,230
he kept doing his bit and then at some

1508
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,579
point he obviously got too high

1509
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:38,839
and he said thanks and walked off the

1510
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:40,899

on this been listening to the show knows

1585
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,039
that I've been working on a breeding

1586
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:13,539
project I've got one light with a very

1587
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:15,819
small breeding project happening in

1588
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:17,470
there the other day I went in there and

1589
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:19,509
pulled out the male plant I collected a

1590
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:21,159
little bit of pollen from him then I cut

1591
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:23,020
the plant down and of course I hosed

1592
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:24,189
myself down with a good shower because I

1593
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:26,260
don't want to get that pollen everywhere

1594
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:29,439
so now the male plant is out of the room

1595
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:31,869
I had one arise male that plant has

1596
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:35,859
dropped his pollen and he is now gone

1597
01:31:31,869 --> 01:31:38,470
there are five arise female types there

1598
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:40,809
are number two number four nuts number

1599
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:43,329
four number five number seven number

1600
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:46,360
eight and then one that was labeled E he

1601
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:48,250
was the remaining phenotype from another

1602
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:49,929
Fino hunt that I liked a lot he has been

1603
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:51,880
around for a minute he is the arise that

1604
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:54,100
you see a lot of pictures of the other

1605
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,500
ones are really good competitors that

1606
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:58,329
have great traits so I've got those five

1607
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:01,060
female phenotypes in there I have one

1608
01:31:58,329 --> 01:32:03,269
golden goat one grateful dog one lemon

1609
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:05,740
skunk all of those are females in there

1610
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:07,600
so there are eight females that have all

1611
01:32:05,739 --> 01:32:09,939
been pollinated by this one male

1612
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,520
there are currently 40 days into flower

1613
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:14,919
it's been about 25 days since

1614
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:17,260
pollination I've still got probably 20

1615
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,720
to 30 days before I can harvest these

1616
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,769
plants and the seeds will be ready

1617
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:25,280
currently the seeds are visible

1618
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:27,079
you can see that the pollen worked these

1619
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,688
plants took this took the pollen they're

1620
01:32:27,078 --> 01:32:32,478
seated now they're developing nicely um

1621
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:33,979
I kind of like to see what's going on so

1622
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,269
the other day I grabbed a bottom bud and

1623
01:32:33,979 --> 01:32:37,280
just pinched one of the seeds out of it

1624
01:32:35,269 --> 01:32:39,649
they're white still but they are

1625
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:41,208
starting to develop an embryo inside the

1626
01:32:39,649 --> 01:32:43,159
shells are getting a little bit hard but

1627
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:45,349
they are still white they taste weird

1628
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:46,698
also if you're curious but they're not

1629
01:32:45,349 --> 01:32:49,429
quite ready yet so we got a little ways

1630
01:32:46,698 --> 01:32:51,108
to go so when they're ready my plan is

1631
01:32:49,429 --> 01:32:53,118
to let them go until those seeds are

1632
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:55,579
really well done and then I'm going to

1633
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:57,648
cut down each plant and label each plant

1634
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:59,448
very carefully as to what it is and I

1635
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:01,189
will hang each plant in its own area

1636
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:02,598
with the bowl underneath it so but if a

1637
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:04,069
seed does fall out I'll catch it

1638
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:06,139
actually you guys I'm a drummer I'm

1639
01:33:04,069 --> 01:33:08,269
gonna use a drum head hope the drum head

1640
01:33:06,139 --> 01:33:10,038
upside down put it underneath each plant

1641
01:33:08,269 --> 01:33:11,439
so they differ seed falls out it lands

1642
01:33:10,038 --> 01:33:14,779
in the drum head it doesn't go anywhere

1643
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:16,639
then once they dry I will take each

1644
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:19,099
plant individually and crush it up into

1645
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:20,538
probably a Tupperware dish I just like

1646
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:22,010
I'll take off the fan leaves and I'll

1647
01:33:20,538 --> 01:33:23,389
crunch it up all the buds yeah just like

1648
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:25,159
hand-ground like I'm gonna roll joints

1649
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:26,449
then I'll just all the seeds will fall

1650
01:33:25,158 --> 01:33:28,488
out at that point I'll pull out all the

1651
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:31,038
seeds I'll separate them I'll jar them

1652
01:33:28,488 --> 01:33:34,279
up I'll label them as to which phenotype

1653
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:37,099
that is like a rise f2 like it'll be a

1654
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:38,478
rise 5f to arise 7 F to whatever planet

1655
01:33:37,099 --> 01:33:40,069
comes from moisture it's labeled and

1656
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:41,239
then I'm gonna grow a bunch of those and

1657
01:33:40,069 --> 01:33:42,530
some of my friends are gonna grow a

1658
01:33:41,238 --> 01:33:44,118
bunch of those and I'm gonna see which a

1659
01:33:42,529 --> 01:33:46,279
rise phenotypes I want to continue

1660
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:47,898
breeding with and then we'll see if this

1661
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:49,219
golden goat The Grateful dog and lemon

1662
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:50,809
skunk will see if they do anything so

1663
01:33:49,219 --> 01:33:52,458
that's my goal I want to make some new

1664
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:54,109
stuff I want to stabilize this and rise

1665
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:56,389
a little bit my goal is actually in the

1666
01:33:54,109 --> 01:33:58,939
long run to take this a rise all the way

1667
01:33:56,389 --> 01:34:01,010
to f5 that's what I would like to do

1668
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:02,628
that will take me a couple of years

1669
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,918
probably two more years maybe three more

1670
01:34:02,628 --> 01:34:05,510
years to get there depending on how

1671
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:08,479
selection goes depending on how stubborn

1672
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:10,668
I am depending on what the f2 s and F

1673
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,079
threes show me all right so that's my

1674
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:13,398
breeding update you guys I appreciate

1675
01:34:12,078 --> 01:34:14,838
you guys sticking around for the

1676
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:16,819
breeding updates with me if you have any

1677
01:34:14,838 --> 01:34:18,349
questions on my breeding project please

1678
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:20,239
send me an email it's girl from me hard

1679
01:34:18,349 --> 01:34:23,619
at hotmail.com I would love to answer

1680
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:25,968
your questions about my breeding project

1681
01:34:23,618 --> 01:34:28,248
alright so let's get into some listener

1682
01:34:25,969 --> 01:34:30,139
emails and this will segue me into the

1683
01:34:28,248 --> 01:34:32,149
reverting and revé edging topic that I

1684
01:34:30,139 --> 01:34:34,250
teased about at the top of the show

1685
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:36,559
we've got a bunch of great messages this

1686
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:38,149
one came on Instagram and this was

1687
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,980
actually this guy had no idea that I was

1688
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:41,689
gonna use this as podcast content this

1689
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:43,729
was a personal convert a conversation

1690
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:46,189
between him and I I don't know if he

1691
01:34:43,729 --> 01:34:47,659
wants me to say his name on the show so

1692
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:49,869
we're just gonna call this the seeded

1693
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:52,279
Erb question and email number one ah

1694
01:34:49,869 --> 01:34:54,019
this guy says quick question I pulled

1695
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:55,939
off almost all the fan leaves on an

1696
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:58,310
early flowering Strawberry Cough plant

1697
01:34:55,939 --> 01:35:01,699
from Sag 'martha seeds this was at five

1698
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:03,890
to six weeks ago I guess the Strawberry

1699
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:05,779
Cough plant threw bananas before I saw

1700
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:07,550
that because I have seeds in all the

1701
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:10,159
plants fully mature now and the only

1702
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:12,680
plant that had bananas was the

1703
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:15,699
Strawberry Cough so when he says he saw

1704
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:18,920
bananas he means that he saw male

1705
01:35:15,699 --> 01:35:20,119
flowers developing on his female plants

1706
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,869
which means that this female was

1707
01:35:20,119 --> 01:35:27,170
actually a hermaphrodite or or it was

1708
01:35:23,869 --> 01:35:29,539
stressed and it caused it to panic and

1709
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:31,789
cause male flowers so that it could try

1710
01:35:29,539 --> 01:35:33,350
to keep itself alive by making more

1711
01:35:31,789 --> 01:35:36,079
seeds and then continuing its

1712
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:38,780
generations so he continues with another

1713
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:40,670
message he says will these banana pollen

1714
01:35:38,779 --> 01:35:43,880
seeds make mostly plants that have a

1715
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:46,880
tendency to toss bananas easily or at

1716
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:49,880
the end that's a really good question

1717
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:53,539
see the thing is the main thing here we

1718
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:55,550
don't know why that Strawberry Cough

1719
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:57,439
plant threw those drop us through those

1720
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,730
bananas we don't know why hermaphrodite

1721
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:00,319
it out on you we don't know if it's a

1722
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:01,819
herm we don't know if it's got herm

1723
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:03,319
traits in it we don't know if it's one

1724
01:36:01,819 --> 01:36:05,929
of its parents was a herm we don't know

1725
01:36:03,319 --> 01:36:07,969
if that specific phenotype is a herm we

1726
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:09,980
don't know why that plant threw bananas

1727
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,600
it could have been stressed things that

1728
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:13,639
would have caused it to throw bananas

1729
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,400
would have been a light leak if that

1730
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,750
plant some things I've seen white comes

1731
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:19,519
in through your ducting you guys are

1732
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,810
ducting those hooded lights

1733
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,250
you've got ducting running you're

1734
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,680
running it out the window or wherever

1735
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,909
light comes reflecting into that and the

1736
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,930
plant that is right underneath that

1737
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:28,970
reflector

1738
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:30,579
I've seen those hermaphrodite because

1739
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:32,510
they are getting hit with light leaks

1740
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:34,369
another thing that could cause that

1741
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:36,199
plant - hermaphrodite could be heat

1742
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:38,420
stress another thing could be over new

1743
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:40,010
training it too much nitrogen toward the

1744
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,980
end of flower could absolutely cause a

1745
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:45,650
plan to become a hermaphrodite too dry

1746
01:36:42,979 --> 01:36:47,718
too moist any kind of weird interruption

1747
01:36:45,649 --> 01:36:49,670
on some strains can cause them to herm

1748
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:51,198
so now the main question is did that

1749
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:53,630
plant herm because it's a hermaphrodite

1750
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:55,399
itself or was it an environmental factor

1751
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,510
either way it's harming that's not

1752
01:36:55,399 --> 01:36:57,920
something's gonna hermaphrodite honey

1753
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,239
that's not something I would keep in my

1754
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,250
garden I would go ahead and get rid of

1755
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:02,599
that one let's talk about the seeds that

1756
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,369
come out of there and I also have

1757
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,650
something else to mention you said that

1758
01:37:04,369 --> 01:37:08,329
every plant that is now mature has seeds

1759
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:09,649
in it that makes me think that you could

1760
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:11,719
have a white leek in there in all of

1761
01:37:09,649 --> 01:37:14,149
those plants all produce seeds because

1762
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:15,890
of light stress and only that Strawberry

1763
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:18,649
Cough showed the hermaphrodite flowers

1764
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:20,000
just because that's a few no typical

1765
01:37:18,649 --> 01:37:21,408
thing the other ones may not have shown

1766
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,630
either hermaphrodite flowers but they

1767
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:25,309
could have seated on their own just from

1768
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:26,989
being stressed even if you didn't see

1769
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:28,370
flowers in there and maybe that

1770
01:37:26,988 --> 01:37:30,259
Strawberry Cough is the only ones you

1771
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:31,640
actually noticed the flowers may be

1772
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:33,619
produced in where you could see him

1773
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,960
that's just a possibility also you're

1774
01:37:33,619 --> 01:37:38,630
right that all could have been seeded by

1775
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,640
that rogue hermaphrodite Strawberry

1776
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:42,289
Cough if that Strawberry Cough is are

1777
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,489
hermaphrodite you may have created some

1778
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:45,619
seeds that may grow some great

1779
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:48,109
phenotypes but you may also run into a

1780
01:37:45,619 --> 01:37:50,000
bunch of hermaphrodites the same thing

1781
01:37:48,109 --> 01:37:51,799
could be true if you got your seeds from

1782
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,198
stressing those plants from white stress

1783
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,969
or from overfeeding or from under

1784
01:37:54,198 --> 01:37:58,039
feeding or for over watering whatever

1785
01:37:55,969 --> 01:38:00,380
caused that you may have produced some

1786
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,539
amazing progeny you also may have

1787
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:04,400
produced a bunch of hermaphrodites my

1788
01:38:02,539 --> 01:38:06,319
main piece of advice is don't share

1789
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:08,119
those seeds with anybody until you've

1790
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:09,738
ran a bunch of them yourself and when

1791
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:12,079
you do give them out make sure people

1792
01:38:09,738 --> 01:38:13,579
know that they do have a tendency or at

1793
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,559
least a likelihood to have some

1794
01:38:13,579 --> 01:38:16,789
hermaphrodite traits in there because we

1795
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,800
don't want people wasting their time

1796
01:38:16,789 --> 01:38:20,899
growing hers when they can be growing

1797
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,279
quality stuff and the guy that sent me

1798
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:24,109
this message you have produced some

1799
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:25,969
quality stuff so let's just stick to

1800
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:27,529
that because my throat's burning out for

1801
01:38:25,969 --> 01:38:28,550
a second I obviously need a quick drink

1802
01:38:27,529 --> 01:38:30,319
I'll be right back

1803
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:31,640
all right you guys I am back while I was

1804
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:34,429
taking a drink and a couple of dabs

1805
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:36,560
something dawned on me our listener and

1806
01:38:34,429 --> 01:38:38,510
his message said that his plant was an

1807
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,710
early flowering Strawberry Cough plant

1808
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:41,600
now that phrase early flowering

1809
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:44,000
indicates a couple of things to me I

1810
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,590
wonder if that plant flowered more

1811
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,988
quickly than the other plants like did

1812
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:50,420
it show flowers and like day 10 when the

1813
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:53,269
other plants waited till day 14 or 15 or

1814
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:55,609
did it flower on its own while it was in

1815
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:56,780
under vege lights under 18 or 24 hours

1816
01:38:55,609 --> 01:38:58,488
of light I'm not sure what you mean by

1817
01:38:56,779 --> 01:39:00,319
early flowering but

1818
01:38:58,488 --> 01:39:02,209
says something to me a plant that wants

1819
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:03,049
to OTO flower like that is probably a

1820
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:05,269
hermaphrodite

1821
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:07,670
the reason it's trying to flower early

1822
01:39:05,269 --> 01:39:09,260
is because a male plant wants to get up

1823
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:11,359
above the female plants it grows a

1824
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,889
little taller it wants to get up above

1825
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,598
the female plants and it wants to start

1826
01:39:12,889 --> 01:39:16,248
dropping pollen so that it's already

1827
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:18,769
speeding out pollen by the time those

1828
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:21,260
females are ready the cannabis plants

1829
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:22,940
whole goal in life is to reproduce so

1830
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:24,769
that plant is probably her man a

1831
01:39:22,939 --> 01:39:26,658
hermaphrodite it wants to get taller

1832
01:39:24,769 --> 01:39:29,269
than everybody wants to flower first it

1833
01:39:26,658 --> 01:39:30,768
wants to have pollen falling before all

1834
01:39:29,269 --> 01:39:32,269
of those females are ready so that it's

1835
01:39:30,769 --> 01:39:33,739
ready for the party it's over there at

1836
01:39:32,269 --> 01:39:35,059
the party setup it's already got a beer

1837
01:39:33,738 --> 01:39:37,759
in hand it's just waiting for the chicks

1838
01:39:35,059 --> 01:39:39,860
to show up so I would not use that plant

1839
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,630
for growing or breeding anymore the

1840
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:43,368
seeds that you made are probably

1841
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:46,038
produced from a hermaphrodite plant

1842
01:39:43,368 --> 01:39:48,259
you're going to see some hermaphroditic

1843
01:39:46,038 --> 01:39:49,698
tendencies in that progeny I wouldn't

1844
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,230
give those out to anybody I would grow

1845
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:54,078
those myself and pay very close

1846
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:56,149
attention to what happens to those

1847
01:39:54,078 --> 01:39:57,439
plants all right dude thanks for the

1848
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:59,089
message if you ever have any more

1849
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:00,498
questions send them to me I will use

1850
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:02,269
more of your stuff on the podcast

1851
01:40:00,498 --> 01:40:04,038
because you have some great questions

1852
01:40:02,269 --> 01:40:05,690
because you're in advanced grower and I

1853
01:40:04,038 --> 01:40:05,960
like where you're going keep up the good

1854
01:40:05,689 --> 01:40:07,879
work

1855
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,139
shout out you're doing a good job I

1856
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,510
won't see your name on the show you know

1857
01:40:09,139 --> 01:40:13,309
I'm talking to alright that brings us to

1858
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:15,230
our next email this is a little bit of

1859
01:40:13,309 --> 01:40:17,420
an update a few episodes ago I was sent

1860
01:40:15,229 --> 01:40:18,738
an email about monster cropping and I

1861
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,300
told the dude that I wasn't sure what he

1862
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:21,709
meant about monster cropping because

1863
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:23,510
when I googled it there were a ton of

1864
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:24,349
different options so I asked him for

1865
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:26,329
more information

1866
01:40:24,349 --> 01:40:28,489
his replied this is what he said he said

1867
01:40:26,328 --> 01:40:30,198
hey bro when I was asking about monster

1868
01:40:28,488 --> 01:40:32,058
cropping I was meaning when you take a

1869
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:34,368
cut off a female plant that's about

1870
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:36,409
three weeks in bloom and revenge her I

1871
01:40:34,368 --> 01:40:38,960
had a buddy telling me about this last

1872
01:40:36,408 --> 01:40:41,899
week he says that the clone goes crazy

1873
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:44,389
making shoots and there's no need to top

1874
01:40:41,899 --> 01:40:45,768
her so I'm assuming you were rivetting

1875
01:40:44,389 --> 01:40:47,150
the clone that you're taking and you

1876
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:49,699
were letting that plant flower and

1877
01:40:47,149 --> 01:40:51,408
finish out that sounds like a decent

1878
01:40:49,698 --> 01:40:52,848
idea if you're taking that clone from

1879
01:40:51,408 --> 01:40:54,558
near the bottom of the plant if you're

1880
01:40:52,849 --> 01:40:57,159
not taking it off of the top because you

1881
01:40:54,559 --> 01:40:59,748
don't want to disrupt the flowering tops

1882
01:40:57,158 --> 01:41:01,339
it kind of seems like it it's a good

1883
01:40:59,748 --> 01:41:03,139
idea it kind of also seems like it could

1884
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:04,969
be a waste of time in the amount of time

1885
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:06,019
you've got a plant that's three weeks in

1886
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:08,300
the flower it's already starting to show

1887
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:10,190
little buds it's already in flower the

1888
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:12,409
hormones have converted it wants to make

1889
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:14,569
buds now you need to take that

1890
01:41:12,409 --> 01:41:16,250
clone and get it in the cloner or how in

1891
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,809
the dome however you do it it needs to

1892
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:20,210
be under 24 hours of light and you have

1893
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:22,700
to revert that plant all the way back to

1894
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:24,949
a vegetative state then you have to veg

1895
01:41:22,699 --> 01:41:27,289
it to the size that you need it and then

1896
01:41:24,949 --> 01:41:29,329
you can flower it but it seems like it

1897
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:31,039
takes a long time and honestly I

1898
01:41:29,329 --> 01:41:32,630
wouldn't even flower out that plant I

1899
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:34,489
would take clones once it started

1900
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:36,289
getting healthy and revé edging and

1901
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:37,969
spitting out proper shoots I would take

1902
01:41:36,289 --> 01:41:40,789
clones of that and turn those clones

1903
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:43,670
into a mother plant and then start over

1904
01:41:40,789 --> 01:41:46,159
so it kind of seems like a lot of work

1905
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:47,869
for just a plant with some extra shoots

1906
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:50,239
to tell you the truth you can pry in the

1907
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:52,069
amount of time that your avenging to

1908
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:54,469
develop those shoots to revenge it to

1909
01:41:52,069 --> 01:41:56,420
get it healthy I could probably just cut

1910
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:58,039
another clone and make a happy plant by

1911
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:59,539
topping and shaping and pruning and

1912
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:01,340
making the plant the size and shape I

1913
01:41:59,539 --> 01:42:04,130
wanted it to be it seems like kind of a

1914
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,750
waste of time in my opinion I'm not

1915
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:07,340
gonna knock anybody's method because

1916
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:09,859
they may have a purpose for this it may

1917
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:11,029
be working for them that's great but I

1918
01:42:09,859 --> 01:42:12,949
bet you in the amount of time you're

1919
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:16,309
spending reeve edging I could probably

1920
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:18,769
just cut clones and do things the simple

1921
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:20,210
way top it train it get it going so it's

1922
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:21,710
a great message I'm glad you told me

1923
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:22,970
what monster cropping is I've never

1924
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:24,529
tried that if anybody else out there

1925
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,869
tried monster cropping send me a message

1926
01:42:24,529 --> 01:42:27,949
send me some pictures let me know more

1927
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:30,199
info about it let me know how it goes

1928
01:42:27,949 --> 01:42:30,889
for you it's easy girl friendly hard at

1929
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:33,170
hotmail.com

1930
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:34,490
I would love to hear from you so we've

1931
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,720
been talking about revenge and I did

1932
01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:37,309
kind of bash it and say that it's sort

1933
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:39,860
of a waste of time but there are times

1934
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:42,320
when reeve edging is a very useful

1935
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:43,699
application there are reasons to do it

1936
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,049
maybe you forgot to take a clone I

1937
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,090
always talk about when you grow from

1938
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:48,650
seed make sure you take clones cuz you

1939
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:50,270
may grow the best [ __ ] you've ever grown

1940
01:42:48,649 --> 01:42:52,250
and if you don't have a clone you're

1941
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:54,170
gonna be angry so if you didn't take a

1942
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:56,210
clone of that plant reeve edging is

1943
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,949
always an option or maybe you're like me

1944
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:59,869
maybe you did take a shits on a clones

1945
01:42:57,949 --> 01:43:01,550
and maybe you [ __ ] up and maybe all

1946
01:42:59,869 --> 01:43:02,869
your clones died so now you don't have

1947
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,730
any clones of that strain that has

1948
01:43:02,869 --> 01:43:06,890
happened to me before and [ __ ] does

1949
01:43:04,729 --> 01:43:08,659
happen or maybe you're even more like me

1950
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:09,950
and my friend Colin maybe you grow too

1951
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:12,109
many seeds and you don't even have any

1952
01:43:09,949 --> 01:43:14,539
room left to take more clones so your

1953
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:16,759
only option is to revert those plants so

1954
01:43:14,539 --> 01:43:18,409
there are reasons why so let's talk a

1955
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,970
little bit about Reve edging Reve edging

1956
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:22,430
is actually when you have flowered out a

1957
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:24,470
cannabis plant and you want to return it

1958
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:26,630
back to its vegetative state so you can

1959
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:28,789
start fresh now like I said before

1960
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:30,679
I would return that plant back to a veg

1961
01:43:28,789 --> 01:43:32,448
state and I would take clones from it

1962
01:43:30,679 --> 01:43:33,829
and then use those clones as my new

1963
01:43:32,448 --> 01:43:35,839
mother plants I wouldn't try to flower

1964
01:43:33,829 --> 01:43:37,219
that one back out it feels to me like

1965
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,140
you would just kind of where that plant

1966
01:43:37,219 --> 01:43:40,730
out you can do it but it's gonna stress

1967
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,770
that plant out it's probably going to

1968
01:43:40,729 --> 01:43:44,329
get weaker as it goes I can't guarantee

1969
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:45,830
that but I wouldn't do it I would take I

1970
01:43:44,329 --> 01:43:47,600
would revenge it and then try to take a

1971
01:43:45,829 --> 01:43:49,010
clone this is like your second chance so

1972
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,060
hopefully your clones live this time

1973
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:52,070
hopefully you don't kill them all

1974
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:53,449
hopefully you remember to take them so

1975
01:43:52,069 --> 01:43:55,399
you're gonna revenge your plant

1976
01:43:53,448 --> 01:43:57,859
something really helpful that will

1977
01:43:55,399 --> 01:44:00,429
really speed up your rivetting process

1978
01:43:57,859 --> 01:44:03,559
and this sounds crazy but this will work

1979
01:44:00,429 --> 01:44:05,630
when you begin to flush approximately

1980
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:08,570
ten to fourteen days before harvest time

1981
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:11,600
I fully recommend that you turn your

1982
01:44:08,569 --> 01:44:13,729
lights back on to eighteen six that's

1983
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:16,969
right no more twelve twelve we went then

1984
01:44:13,729 --> 01:44:19,099
we want them on for 18 hours and off for

1985
01:44:16,969 --> 01:44:23,090
six hours a day for the last ten to

1986
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:25,070
fourteen days of your flowering cycle so

1987
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:27,980
while you're flushing change the timer

1988
01:44:25,069 --> 01:44:30,409
back to 18 6 isn't enough that two-week

1989
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:32,839
period isn't enough time to revert those

1990
01:44:30,409 --> 01:44:35,090
plants back to veg since they're so far

1991
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,130
along and flower and you may see some of

1992
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:39,440
the buds start to try to revert just

1993
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:40,640
harvest you're cool it's time just do

1994
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,559
that it's harvest time anyway you're

1995
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:45,619
cutting those plants down it's cool so

1996
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:48,080
about 10 to 14 days before harvest time

1997
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:49,819
put your timer back on to 18 6 that is

1998
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:51,890
your veg schedule put it back on there

1999
01:44:49,819 --> 01:44:54,829
that'll get the plants sped up back into

2000
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:56,060
the revenge phase let them finish cut

2001
01:44:54,829 --> 01:44:59,569
your plants down when you're harvesting

2002
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:01,730
leave the bottom three buds on the

2003
01:44:59,569 --> 01:45:03,710
bottom branches of your plant so if

2004
01:45:01,729 --> 01:45:05,269
you've got a single stock plant if you

2005
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:07,130
did not top if you've got a plant with

2006
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:08,840
one stock coming up there's a little

2007
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,310
intersection where it makes a peace sign

2008
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,750
right you got the main stock going up

2009
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:14,000
you got a branch coming off the left you

2010
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:15,289
got a branch coming off the right up the

2011
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,719
left branch and up the right branch

2012
01:45:15,289 --> 01:45:20,420
there will be little buds leave those

2013
01:45:17,719 --> 01:45:23,539
buds you want to leave the bottom three

2014
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:25,130
buds on those bottom branches so from

2015
01:45:23,539 --> 01:45:27,170
the bottom of the plant up find the

2016
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:28,940
bottom ones and then go one two three

2017
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:30,710
leave those three buds and harvest

2018
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:32,210
everything else on the bottom two

2019
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,010
branches if you topped it you've got

2020
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:36,140
four branches on those bottom four leave

2021
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:38,179
the bottom three buds that's what you're

2022
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:39,320
going to revert into a vegetative plant

2023
01:45:38,179 --> 01:45:41,600
and start

2024
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:43,759
so once you've harvested the plant move

2025
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,860
it to a room with 24 hours of light you

2026
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,500
can either use a t5 you can use a metal

2027
01:45:45,859 --> 01:45:50,479
halide or you can use an LED the more

2028
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:52,640
light you use the more quickly your

2029
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:54,589
plant will return back to a vegetative

2030
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,630
stage and you can start taking clones

2031
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:58,909
from it and then use one of those clones

2032
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:01,130
as a new mother plant veg that one out

2033
01:45:58,909 --> 01:46:02,988
and then take clones from that and those

2034
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:05,000
clones can be your next crop I feel like

2035
01:46:02,988 --> 01:46:06,738
you've now solved the problem of a

2036
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,850
flowering plant you fix the hormones

2037
01:46:06,738 --> 01:46:09,349
you've gotten it back to the way it

2038
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:11,480
should be as a vegetative plant and you

2039
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:12,739
were right back where you began one

2040
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:14,839
thing I should mention is while you're

2041
01:46:12,738 --> 01:46:17,809
waiting for your plant to revert you

2042
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:20,029
should feed it with kelp and vegetative

2043
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:21,680
nutrients just use your basic veg newts

2044
01:46:20,029 --> 01:46:24,109
more nitrogen will help speed up the

2045
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,090
process but don't overdo it now if you

2046
01:46:24,109 --> 01:46:28,429
want to speed up this process there is

2047
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:31,819
one thing that you can do you can add

2048
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:34,789
two hundred particles per million of ga3

2049
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:36,949
that's gibberellic acid to your feed and

2050
01:46:34,789 --> 01:46:39,829
it will really speed up the reverting

2051
01:46:36,949 --> 01:46:42,469
process what this will do now earlier I

2052
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:45,500
talked about taking that flowering plant

2053
01:46:42,469 --> 01:46:47,329
and reverting it back to veg and then

2054
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,859
taking a clone from that and using that

2055
01:46:47,329 --> 01:46:50,809
clone as your new mother and then

2056
01:46:48,859 --> 01:46:52,880
cutting clones from that one if you use

2057
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:54,560
the gibberellic acid I feel like you can

2058
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,810
take that plant that was flowering and

2059
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,310
you can revert it and then take clones

2060
01:46:56,810 --> 01:47:00,920
from it and those clones will be

2061
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:02,360
completely fine to work with keep one of

2062
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,829
those is your mother plant flower out

2063
01:47:02,359 --> 01:47:06,500
the rest of them and you were back on

2064
01:47:03,829 --> 01:47:08,779
track with vegetative plants and a

2065
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:10,219
mother you did not lose your strain now

2066
01:47:08,779 --> 01:47:12,050
you can grow that strain forever and

2067
01:47:10,219 --> 01:47:13,929
keep it around make sure you take clones

2068
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:15,399
from here on out

2069
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:16,628
that's how you do revision guys I hope

2070
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:17,590
you learned a lot from that I want to

2071
01:47:16,628 --> 01:47:19,359
give you a huge shot it's my friend

2075
01:47:22,359 --> 01:47:26,168
strongly endorsed that brand Colin knows

2076

01:55:57,619 --> 01:56:00,109
I'm try not to call from the microphone

2154
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:25,369
get everything set up here I think we're

2155
01:56:00,109 --> 01:56:27,859
ready to talk about this claiming that

2156
01:56:25,369 --> 01:56:32,420
this dude in France is has trained his

2157
01:56:27,859 --> 01:56:36,259
honey bees to make th laden honey by

2158
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:39,470
collecting THC from cannabis plants now

2159
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:40,460
I'm not a bee expert but I don't think

2160
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:44,449
that's how this works

2161
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:46,159
I I'm here to say that I don't think

2162
01:56:44,449 --> 01:56:48,500
that this is real I think it's [ __ ]

2163
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:50,119
to tell you the truth I when I first

2164
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:52,640
thought online I was like oh that's

2165
01:56:50,119 --> 01:56:56,930
really cool I want to wait bees collect

2166
01:56:52,640 --> 01:57:00,740
pollen yes trichomes collect pollen yeah

2167
01:56:56,930 --> 01:57:02,810
they are not themselves the pistils

2168
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:05,059
collect the pollen to be more to be more

2169
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:08,060
accurate but the pollen is actually used

2170
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:11,240
as a defense against insects and they do

2171
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:14,440
show pictures of bees on the canopy on

2172
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:17,539
the female cannabis plants and what

2173
01:57:14,439 --> 01:57:19,250
somebody says in one of these debunking

2174
01:57:17,539 --> 01:57:20,090
websites cuz I did do research before I

2175
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,710
came on long time

2176
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:23,449
it out on a podcast and said that it was

2177
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:24,829
[ __ ] I did do some research to back

2178
01:57:23,449 --> 01:57:27,199
myself up they claimed that they just

2179
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:29,119
simply sprayed sugar water on the

2180
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:32,179
budding female plants to encourage those

2181
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:34,309
bees to land their yes maybe a little

2182
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:37,130
bit of THC as a marketing ploy for

2183
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:39,920
homies honey I think so yeah so in his

2184
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:43,159
video they do show male plants yeah so

2185
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,949
what I think may be happening little bit

2186
01:57:43,159 --> 01:57:48,590
this guy says he's getting THC honey

2187
01:57:45,949 --> 01:57:50,599
from cannabis plant he can be doing that

2188
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:52,730
he maybe that's totally a thing it's

2189
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:54,800
just not gonna be psychoactive right he

2190
01:57:52,729 --> 01:57:56,209
may be getting pollen from male cannabis

2191
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,550
plants those bees are gathering that

2192
01:57:56,210 --> 01:58:00,199
pollen they're flying back to their hive

2193
01:57:58,550 --> 01:58:01,250
they're putting that pollen in little

2194
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:04,010
thing that they put it in a little

2195
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:06,319
honeycomb and then they actually bees

2196
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:07,940
actually chew up the pollen in their

2197
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:10,159
mouths and they regurgitate it and

2198
01:58:07,939 --> 01:58:13,159
something in their regurgitation creates

2199
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:14,420
the the nectar to turn into honey see

2200
01:58:13,159 --> 01:58:16,849
this is why I don't like knowing how

2201
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:22,569
everything's made yes nature's [ __ ]

2202
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:34,730
gross yeah it's straight up bee puke

2203
01:58:22,569 --> 01:58:36,409
you're pretty tasty Jelly Belly has

2204
01:58:34,729 --> 01:58:40,969
created some new flavors and one of

2205
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:43,010
their new flavors is vomit vomit

2206
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:46,039
flavored jelly bellys that's not funny

2207
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:47,659
so these these flies these bees are good

2208
01:58:46,039 --> 01:58:49,069
and they're collecting they could be

2209
01:58:47,659 --> 01:58:50,809
collecting the male pollen from these

2210
01:58:49,069 --> 01:58:52,579
male plants and flying back and creating

2211
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:55,910
honey out of that that is very feasible

2212
01:58:52,579 --> 01:58:57,890
I do not see how they could land on a

2213
01:58:55,909 --> 01:58:59,720
female cannabis plant with trichomes on

2214
01:58:57,890 --> 01:59:01,970
it gather trichomes and fly enough

2215
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,170
trichomes back to the hive to make

2216
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:05,630
cannabis honey that doesn't seem

2217
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:07,640
feasible to me well I don't see them

2218
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:09,560
purposefully gathering the tribes are

2219
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:11,480
there so any sort of tri-coat gatherings

2220
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:13,520
gonna be incidental or accidental yeah

2221
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:15,439
completely and I think that it's

2222
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:18,440
probably ever been trimming and rub your

2223
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:20,119
eye yeah don't do that it burns

2224
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:21,889
we've spent like the first half hour at

2225
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:23,420
any new trim gig warning the dude the

2226
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:27,230
new people not to do that right and

2227
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:29,720
somebody will do it it happens it's the

2228
01:59:27,229 --> 01:59:31,719
plant gives off pheromones sometimes

2229
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:34,180
people have allergy

2230
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,409
reactions to it and sometimes your face

2231
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:37,060
gets itchy when you're tripping that's

2232
01:59:35,409 --> 01:59:41,380
just a thing and so you rub your eye and

2233
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:42,730
it burns getting maced and it sucks you

2234
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:44,529
can't make it quick because your fingers

2235
01:59:42,729 --> 01:59:47,139
are sticky cuz you're trimming so you

2236
01:59:44,529 --> 01:59:49,869
got to deal with it I think that the pH

2237
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:50,980
was far too hot for these bees to be

2238
01:59:49,869 --> 01:59:52,390
able to handle it I think it would burn

2239
01:59:50,979 --> 01:59:53,889
the bees I think they would just be like

2240
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:55,539
nah [ __ ] this I don't want anything to

2241
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:58,119
do with it see I don't know if it would

2242
01:59:55,539 --> 02:00:02,319
be too acidic or to like burn them but I

2243
01:59:58,119 --> 02:00:04,420
think that that's definitely part of

2244
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:06,909
what the trichome is designed to do it's

2245
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:09,250
partially to keep those bugs away from

2246
02:00:06,909 --> 02:00:12,010
there so you can see this totally be

2247
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:15,039
like this there may be serious benefits

2248
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:17,050
to bees collecting male cannabis pollen

2249
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:19,779
and turning that into honey but it's

2250
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:21,760
definitely not like weed honey is as

2251
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:23,710
advertised right it's a very cool

2252
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:26,409
marketing ploy it is a very cool video

2253
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:28,270
but I think it is inaccurate I think

2254
02:00:26,409 --> 02:00:30,699
it's misleading and I don't think you're

2255
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:32,470
getting THC honey I want to see this

2256
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:34,179
happen you know what I mean I want it to

2257
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:35,650
be somebody said earlier they ain't

2258
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:39,159
gonna do it on the honor system I want

2259
02:00:35,649 --> 02:00:44,500
to watch this honey and I want to watch

2260
02:00:39,159 --> 02:00:46,329
the bees honey to a lab and let's deep

2261
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:50,050
hill test that honey for me and see what

2262
02:00:46,329 --> 02:00:52,329
type of cannabinoids are in there before

2263
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:54,909
the show is for that to happen we would

2264
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:58,869
have to bring this me to Colorado with

2265
02:00:54,909 --> 02:01:00,010
his bees and his cannabis plants because

2266
02:00:58,869 --> 02:01:01,630
that's the only place on the planet

2267
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:03,250
where we could really collect and lab

2268
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:05,109
test that in a controlled way without

2269
02:01:03,250 --> 02:01:08,199
him going to jail immediately after I

2270
02:01:05,109 --> 02:01:10,179
think you can do it in Spain man he's in

2271
02:01:08,199 --> 02:01:16,510
France so he's just a border jump boy I

2272
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:18,100
think spins spannabis and there's a

2273
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:19,420
hillside in Spain I forget the name of

2274
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,890
the place I feel bad that I can't

2275
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:22,239
remember the name of the region but

2276
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:23,740
there's a small region in Spain where

2277
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:25,929
they do not care about cannabis growing

2278
02:01:23,739 --> 02:01:27,849
there a lot of people go there yeah they

2279
02:01:25,930 --> 02:01:29,560
might have the ability to grow but do

2280
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:31,660
they have the access to the same test

2281
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:32,590
and kind of Slavs that we do that's a

2282
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:35,050
very good question

2283
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:36,640
because both in the same area are one of

2284
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:38,650
the things that make Colorado's cannabis

2285
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:41,110
market so awesome dude come to Colorado

2286
02:01:38,649 --> 02:01:43,359
bring your bees bring your bring your

2287
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:44,229
gear will do we got a do we want to see

2288
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:47,289
this happen we

2289
02:01:44,229 --> 02:01:49,059
test your biryani dude in a mildly

2290
02:01:47,289 --> 02:01:53,319
related note the dude in Oregon that's

2291
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:55,330
doing the Hogs no yeah you know how here

2292
02:01:53,319 --> 02:01:57,099
the waste from the cannabis grow you

2293
02:01:55,329 --> 02:02:01,029
have to do specific stuff with it so it

2294
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:02,739
doesn't end up right whatever ground up

2295
02:02:01,029 --> 02:02:04,659
into little tiny pieces run through a

2296
02:02:02,738 --> 02:02:09,189
wood chipper and then mixed with other

2297
02:02:04,659 --> 02:02:11,139
product right a shop up in Oregon found

2298
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:13,599
a hog farmer to take care of a farm

2299
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:16,210
perfect and so they take all that plant

2300
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:18,160
material and I I'm not exactly sure what

2301
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:19,689
he what the farmer does to it between

2302
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:21,069
picking it up from the shop and dropping

2303
02:02:19,689 --> 02:02:24,219
it off with the pigs but I'm assuming

2304
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:26,019
it's not much and they chow down on that

2305
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:26,500
as a primary food source for most of

2306
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:28,390
their lives

2307
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:30,250
that's the Rocky Mountain worm company

2308
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:31,989
in Colorado Springs has a deal worked

2309
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:35,199
out with the very well-known vape pen

2310
02:02:31,988 --> 02:02:36,699
company open they grow their products in

2311
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:38,260
their warehouse they chopped down their

2312
02:02:36,699 --> 02:02:41,319
plants and the waste from their plants

2313
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:43,659
is then it's mixed properly so that it's

2314
02:02:41,319 --> 02:02:45,309
meb compliant and the media's approve

2315
02:02:43,659 --> 02:02:47,738
this transaction they send all of the

2316
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:48,970
waste to the rocky mountain worm company

2317
02:02:47,738 --> 02:02:51,579
and the rocky mountain worm companies

2318
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:53,619
feeding that back to their worms and the

2319
02:02:51,579 --> 02:02:55,809
worms compost that and then the rocky

2320
02:02:53,619 --> 02:02:58,000
mountain worm company in turn sells

2321
02:02:55,810 --> 02:03:00,370
their worm castings at a discount back

2322
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,560
to open vapes gross it's brilliant it

2323
02:03:00,369 --> 02:03:04,180
goes full circle yeah so it's getting

2324
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:06,010
reused and reef add back to the worms

2325
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:07,630
it's kind of keeping it a little more

2326
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:10,000
eco-friendly we need to learn as growers

2327
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:11,980
as professional responsible growers it

2328
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,479
is time to figure out how to reduce our

2329
02:03:11,979 --> 02:03:15,399
carbon footprint I don't know how to do

2330
02:03:13,479 --> 02:03:17,738
that very well well a lot of the places

2331
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:20,920
the the laws around cannabis make that

2332
02:03:17,738 --> 02:03:22,329
specific topic incredibly brutal right

2333
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:24,340
and Boulder I think they have to run

2334
02:03:22,329 --> 02:03:26,829
solar to offset all of their electricity

2335
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:30,369
or something has to law in Boulder say a

2336
02:03:26,829 --> 02:03:32,559
hundred marijuana businesses had to be a

2337
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:34,090
hundred percent energy neutral which

2338
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:37,480
means they can't consume any power they

2339
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:39,449
don't generate and immediately after

2340
02:03:37,479 --> 02:03:40,929
passing that law they realized how

2341
02:03:39,449 --> 02:03:42,819
unenforceable and I are not

2342
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:45,220
unenforceable but unfeasible it was to

2343
02:03:42,819 --> 02:03:50,409
require that immediately and so they've

2344
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:51,730
been given some time to upgrade but this

2345
02:03:50,409 --> 02:03:54,510
is one of the things that made pueblo so

2346
02:03:51,729 --> 02:03:56,859
popular is that we allow greenhouse

2347
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:57,179
Denver is now a greenhouse Boulder just

2348
02:03:56,859 --> 02:03:58,558
not

2349
02:03:57,179 --> 02:04:00,538
greenhouse and we have the prime

2350
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:02,670
greenhouse area here is perfect

2351
02:04:00,538 --> 02:04:04,559
greenhouse country beautiful country

2352
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:07,260
here to grow cannabis or him yep we

2353
02:04:04,559 --> 02:04:09,659
designated a whole bunch of water just

2354
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:11,670
kind of set it aside for you no that's

2355
02:04:09,658 --> 02:04:13,319
all well least marijuana grows at the

2356
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:15,630
beginning of this we've barely touched

2357
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:18,748
that number cool so there's a ton of

2358
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:19,889
that still in reserve industry as it is

2359
02:04:18,748 --> 02:04:21,658
down here that's one of the hardest

2360
02:04:19,889 --> 02:04:23,279
things to do is to get the water rights

2361
02:04:21,658 --> 02:04:25,078
once you get something set up you can

2362
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:27,420
get a water a lawyer there was something

2363
02:04:25,078 --> 02:04:30,179
nobody thought of until about a year and

2364
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:32,309
a half two years ago when we finally

2365
02:04:30,179 --> 02:04:35,849
finished the rules and regs process

2366
02:04:32,309 --> 02:04:37,559
you can't just hammer out a well and go

2367
02:04:35,849 --> 02:04:39,479
to town down here in Southern Colorado

2368
02:04:37,559 --> 02:04:41,159
we've got a lot of rules when it comes

2369
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:42,449
to water here yeah well they know they

2370
02:04:41,158 --> 02:04:44,219
know that big commercial growers are

2371
02:04:42,448 --> 02:04:45,658
coming and trying to use up the water

2372
02:04:44,219 --> 02:04:48,389
and they want to keep it for you and I

2373
02:04:45,658 --> 02:04:49,948
had a drink which was a good water plan

2374
02:04:48,389 --> 02:04:52,800
down here so all that's taken care of

2375
02:04:49,948 --> 02:04:55,138
the it's one of the more recent anti pod

2376
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,779
talking points is how much water the

2377
02:04:55,139 --> 02:04:59,670
plant drinks or how much energy growing

2378
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:02,429
it endure cost it's like well you know

2379
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:04,828
if you didn't prohibit it in 46 of the

2380
02:05:02,429 --> 02:05:07,078
50 states more of it would be grown

2381
02:05:04,828 --> 02:05:09,149
under the Sun will be using

2382
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:10,529
significantly less power to produce all

2383
02:05:09,149 --> 02:05:13,198
this if we could just grow it outdoors

2384
02:05:10,529 --> 02:05:15,569
like a normal crop but oh no when do we

2385
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:18,748
vote on the city elections for 200 and

2386
02:05:15,569 --> 02:05:20,670
300 in the presidential November

2387
02:05:18,748 --> 02:05:23,279
November November 8 we will put out a

2388
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:24,868
podcast I'm making a note yeah we'll do

2389
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:27,359
an election podcast at some point people

2390
02:05:24,868 --> 02:05:29,988
this is not that episode we need to

2391
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:33,420
guide people on what to vote on locally

2392
02:05:29,988 --> 02:05:35,218
specifically do a little segment on it

2393
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:37,949
just for them what's the date today is

2394
02:05:35,219 --> 02:05:40,109
today the 9th today maybe the ninth okay

2395
02:05:37,948 --> 02:05:42,478
so yesterday was the last day for people

2396
02:05:40,109 --> 02:05:44,969
to submit ballot issue paperwork so the

2397
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:46,619
final election ballots they're all

2398
02:05:44,969 --> 02:05:48,599
hammering out that paperwork now so

2399
02:05:46,618 --> 02:05:50,458
we'll have all the final information for

2400
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:52,559
November here no we could do so it's

2401
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:54,868
perfect perfect we'll do an episode to

2402
02:05:52,559 --> 02:05:56,909
teach you guys locally what to vote for

2403
02:05:54,868 --> 02:05:58,589
because the wording is confusing I do

2404
02:05:56,908 --> 02:06:00,299
agree with that there's gonna be it's

2405
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:02,699
more way more than one question it's not

2406
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:04,708
just via yes or no vote yes for we vote

2407
02:06:02,698 --> 02:06:07,569
no against weed it's gonna be much more

2408
02:06:04,708 --> 02:06:09,158
complicated than that yeah all right so

2409
02:06:07,569 --> 02:06:13,059
this episode I want to put this back on

2410
02:06:09,158 --> 02:06:19,000
some some educational topics some rails

2411
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:20,980
Mike's not a headache he's really his

2412
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,060
color came back he's more relaxed I can

2413
02:06:20,979 --> 02:06:23,439
see that the headache has kind of gone

2414
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:25,480
away a little bit you feeling better bro

2415
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:27,129
I'm feeling a lot better where's the

2416
02:06:25,479 --> 02:06:29,019
profit container because I got three of

2417
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:33,480
them they look alike the product I'm

2418
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:37,389
consuming right now is three percent THC

2419
02:06:33,479 --> 02:06:41,078
1.3 percent CBD thirty eight point nine

2420
02:06:37,389 --> 02:06:44,590
nine percent CBD a and six there thirty

2421
02:06:41,078 --> 02:06:48,460
six point three two percent THC a and an

2422
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:50,920
additional six percent CPG so this has

2423
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:57,760
got a a bizarrely wide range of

2424
02:06:50,920 --> 02:07:05,440
cannabinoids in it and what kind of hash

2425
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:06,730
would you call that what kind of at

2426
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:08,948
about sixty five degrees

2427
02:07:06,729 --> 02:07:13,000
it's a pretty nice shatter it shatters

2428
02:07:08,948 --> 02:07:15,399
real nice it's seventy it's really

2429
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,779
sticky taffy okay you take two pieces

2430
02:07:15,399 --> 02:07:19,089
you pull it apart it just kind of

2431
02:07:16,779 --> 02:07:20,529
stretches I want you to get out of there

2432
02:07:19,090 --> 02:07:24,130
it can be a little tricky to get a DAB

2433
02:07:20,529 --> 02:07:25,840
out of there it it above like 65 so what

2434
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:27,609
he's talking about is a smokeable

2435
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:31,389
concentrate it's some hash some chatter

2436
02:07:27,609 --> 02:07:32,710
with a pretty good CBD to THC ratio it's

2437
02:07:31,389 --> 02:07:34,599
about 50/50

2438
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:35,710
you could tell Mike was hurting about 20

2439
02:07:34,599 --> 02:07:39,670
minutes ago he had a pretty good

2440
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:42,460
headache and heat all right let's record

2441
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:43,719
a podcast so the CBD definitely reduced

2442
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:45,069
of the pain in your headache and it

2443
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:47,289
improved your attitude because of that

2444
02:07:45,069 --> 02:07:49,868
oh yeah I feel a hundred percent better

2445
02:07:47,289 --> 02:07:52,448
now that I've put something that's half

2446
02:07:49,868 --> 02:07:55,479
and half THC CBD into my system for the

2447
02:07:52,448 --> 02:07:56,919
day my knees feel better my neck the

2448
02:07:55,479 --> 02:07:58,839
tension in my neck feels better

2449
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:01,060
I had a wicked headache when I got here

2450
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:02,619
folks that was uh we're sitting at the

2451
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:04,060
table kind of catching up and dabbing

2452
02:08:02,618 --> 02:08:06,158
and I'm basically just staring at the

2453
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:08,619
table rubbing my eyes and my temples cuz

2454
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:10,420
it hurts so bad I'm thinking I might not

2455
02:08:08,618 --> 02:08:12,250
podcast and I might just have to bail

2456
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:15,489
after a day or two and go home some hurt

2457
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:18,969
and the addition of some CBD into my

2458
02:08:15,488 --> 02:08:20,629
world has reset that completely I've

2459
02:08:18,969 --> 02:08:24,500
been a big fantasy me

2460
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:26,170
for a long time it's good for tells you

2461
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:29,179
I'll put it that way that's the truth

2462
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:31,579
one thing that I and I've said on the

2463
02:08:29,179 --> 02:08:33,260
show I'm not a huge smoker of CBD I

2464
02:08:31,579 --> 02:08:36,019
don't use a lot of CBD product when I

2465
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:37,969
smoke I prefer a nice THC head buzz I

2466
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:39,860
want to get high I want to make my head

2467
02:08:37,969 --> 02:08:41,840
spin I want to get confused I want to

2468
02:08:39,859 --> 02:08:43,429
get goofy only a talkative that's what a

2469
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,489
good sativa does to me when I smoke too

2470
02:08:43,429 --> 02:08:49,639
much CBD I honestly just get lazy and it

2471
02:08:46,488 --> 02:08:52,579
kind of ruins my hi-yah I'm not stoned

2472
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:55,730
right now and that's I took four knobs

2473
02:08:52,579 --> 02:08:57,109
all THC dabs here a minute ago and I had

2474
02:08:55,729 --> 02:08:58,549
a nice little buzz going on but right

2475
02:08:57,109 --> 02:09:01,399
before the show I don't want my headache

2476
02:08:58,550 --> 02:09:04,250
to come back so I took two more half and

2477
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:13,219
half THC CBD dabs and it it brought me

2478
02:09:04,250 --> 02:09:14,779
my high back down I liked it too if you

2479
02:09:13,219 --> 02:09:15,800
want to feel free to reach in I'm gonna

2480
02:09:14,779 --> 02:09:18,408
pull this piece off right here for

2481
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:25,579
myself but here's some piece it's like

2482
02:09:18,408 --> 02:09:30,229
six of my dabs it looks like a flag that

2483
02:09:25,579 --> 02:09:35,000
Dad would be American flag probably

2484
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:38,479
about 0.3 ish I I don't use a lot of CBD

2485
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,420
products but one time listeners of this

2486
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:51,529
podcast don't know over a year ago in

2487
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:54,020
April of 2015 and I was having issues my

2488
02:09:51,529 --> 02:09:56,420
head hurt for three weeks

2489
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:58,250
like honestly my head was throbbing I

2490
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:59,779
was [ __ ] up I had a traumatic but I

2491
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:01,850

2493
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:06,380
lot of it's been over 18 months and I

2494
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:08,090
still have effects from that concussion

2495
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:10,340
I knocked myself clean the [ __ ] out I

2496
02:10:08,090 --> 02:10:12,529
was out for a good 30 to 45 seconds like

2497
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:15,739
unconscious on the ground people had to

2498
02:10:12,529 --> 02:10:18,439
pick me up get me going again it [ __ ]

2499
02:10:15,738 --> 02:10:20,899
me up my head hurt for several days I

2500
02:10:18,439 --> 02:10:24,079
could not get right when I took a DAB oh

2501
02:10:20,899 --> 02:10:26,179
you were yourself for six weeks after

2502
02:10:24,079 --> 02:10:27,998
yeah no I was myself for six months

2503
02:10:26,179 --> 02:10:31,168
after it felt like

2504
02:10:27,998 --> 02:10:34,298
there was a substantial improvement

2505
02:10:31,168 --> 02:10:36,998
after about six weeks but I mean it took

2506
02:10:34,298 --> 02:10:41,349
half a year before you were feeling like

2507
02:10:36,998 --> 02:10:43,599
yourself all the way in so Spencer would

2508
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:45,369
invite me over just to check on me come

2509
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:46,509
hang out you've been like you could tell

2510
02:10:45,368 --> 02:10:47,498
I was getting depressed cuz when you get

2511
02:10:46,509 --> 02:10:48,908
your head and have a traumatic brain

2512
02:10:47,498 --> 02:10:50,288
injury you get depressed and chickies

2513
02:10:48,908 --> 02:10:52,088
you're not the same that you used to be

2514
02:10:50,288 --> 02:10:54,309
my skills weren't where they were and I

2515
02:10:52,088 --> 02:10:55,838
was bummed out so my friends really

2516
02:10:54,309 --> 02:10:56,619
hanging out trying to help me out at all

2517
02:10:55,838 --> 02:10:58,568
my friends it helped me through that

2518
02:10:56,618 --> 02:11:00,548
head injury but Spence would invite me

2519
02:10:58,569 --> 02:11:03,189
over and one night he's like bro I made

2520
02:11:00,548 --> 02:11:04,899
some CBD hash oil for the cannabis cup

2521
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:06,548
and this should actually won the best

2522
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:12,039
CBD concentrate at the High Times

2523
02:11:06,548 --> 02:11:14,828
Cannabis but he gave me a big smoke

2524
02:11:12,038 --> 02:11:16,538
normal shatter like THC or sativas my

2525
02:11:14,828 --> 02:11:20,469
head would throb even more it would just

2526
02:11:16,538 --> 02:11:22,448
feel like I can feel it and I felt like

2527
02:11:20,469 --> 02:11:24,429
I had I felt like I had a belt around my

2528
02:11:22,448 --> 02:11:26,469

2533
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:36,009

02:13:08,969 --> 02:13:17,199
that you can tumble down unreleased on

2569
02:13:14,189 --> 02:13:20,570
my feet was one of the really fun

2570
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:24,688
[Music]

2571
02:13:20,569 --> 02:13:26,849
California but the results all this

2572
02:13:24,689 --> 02:13:28,889
trauma over the years of having fun in

2573
02:13:26,849 --> 02:13:30,300
Colorado is that there's a lot of

2574
02:13:28,889 --> 02:13:33,659
inflammation and a lot of swelling in

2575
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:36,510
places the press-on nerves and then that

2576
02:13:33,658 --> 02:13:38,248
causes phantom nerve pain are basically

2577
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:40,229
the same stuff amputees get with like

2578
02:13:38,248 --> 02:13:44,969
they lose a finger and then a finger

2579
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:47,939
tingles or hurts those nerves create or

2580
02:13:44,969 --> 02:13:49,918
or make up or feel that they're getting

2581
02:13:47,939 --> 02:13:51,929
signals they're not really getting and

2582
02:13:49,918 --> 02:13:53,398
it can feel like it's tingling or

2583
02:13:51,929 --> 02:13:56,939
tickling or it can feel like it's on

2584
02:13:53,399 --> 02:14:00,559
fire or stuck in a car door or it'll go

2585
02:13:56,939 --> 02:14:02,729
numb and when I first stumbled on

2586
02:14:00,559 --> 02:14:04,498
medical marijuana that was one of the

2587
02:14:02,729 --> 02:14:07,499
things I like to do it helped me ignore

2588
02:14:04,498 --> 02:14:09,300
that sensation but it wasn't until I

2589
02:14:07,498 --> 02:14:13,408
found something that was a good ratio

2590
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:15,989
with THC CBD that I really started to

2591
02:14:13,408 --> 02:14:17,368
attack that inflammation and bring it

2592
02:14:15,988 --> 02:14:19,888
down to a point where it doesn't hurt

2593
02:14:17,368 --> 02:14:21,148
anymore like it's hard to explain to

2594
02:14:19,889 --> 02:14:22,529
somebody when you're at work and they're

2595
02:14:21,149 --> 02:14:24,749
like why are you rubbing your hand and

2596
02:14:22,529 --> 02:14:28,768
it's like well because the the three

2597
02:14:24,748 --> 02:14:30,208
small fingers are numb and my thumb and

2598
02:14:28,769 --> 02:14:32,369
my index finger feel like they're stuck

2599
02:14:30,208 --> 02:14:33,988
in a car door and it was like that when

2600
02:14:32,368 --> 02:14:35,908
I woke up and I can't make it go away

2601
02:14:33,988 --> 02:14:38,938
but like which Jackie did you want to

2602
02:14:35,908 --> 02:14:40,408
try on it's just one of those things

2603
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:42,479
that sucks that you just have to deal

2604
02:14:40,408 --> 02:14:44,819
with and so I found something with there

2605
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:46,409
really helped that inflammation I was

2606
02:14:44,819 --> 02:14:47,658
just taking random pills that the doctor

2607
02:14:46,408 --> 02:14:49,978
gave me and going to the chiropractor

2608
02:14:47,658 --> 02:14:51,509
and the pills didn't do a [ __ ] thing

2609
02:14:49,979 --> 02:14:51,789
other than mess with my stomach in my

2610
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:55,020
life

2611
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:57,279
but the chiropractor was helping some

2612
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:59,680
but when I found something that's have

2613
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:01,300
to have CBD that inflammation really

2614
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:05,890
started to come down and I started

2615
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:08,440
having lower pain days I'm lower crazy

2616
02:15:05,890 --> 02:15:11,079
sensation days and then slowly but

2617
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:13,539
surely I started getting pain free days

2618
02:15:11,079 --> 02:15:16,059
do those first couple pain-free days

2619
02:15:13,539 --> 02:15:16,569
were the do office look it was a

2620
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:19,090
teenager

2621
02:15:16,569 --> 02:15:21,729
yeah like never happened guess your

2622
02:15:19,090 --> 02:15:24,100
endocannabinoid system back in line and

2623
02:15:21,729 --> 02:15:26,949
now that the rec industry has progressed

2624
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:28,780
where it is there are several places in

2625
02:15:26,949 --> 02:15:32,170
town where I can go in and pick up half

2626
02:15:28,779 --> 02:15:34,059
THC F CBD concentrates in like when I

2627
02:15:32,170 --> 02:15:35,770
get home from one end of a long day my

2628
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:38,320
knees are swollen a little bit my feet

2629
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:39,970
hurt my back hurts I've eaten enough

2630
02:15:38,319 --> 02:16:08,739
[ __ ] for the day and I'm in kind of

2631
02:15:39,970 --> 02:16:11,770
a foul mood 2 or 3 D for the win yes

2632
02:16:08,739 --> 02:16:14,229
medical marijuana has saved for sure I

2633
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:16,120
don't know if I honestly I it's hard to

2634
02:16:14,229 --> 02:16:17,709
think stuff like this right now because

2635
02:16:16,119 --> 02:16:19,630
we've lost a lot of people this year but

2636
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:21,630
I don't know if Doug could still be here

2637
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:24,609
without medical marijuana you know

2638
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:26,230
mentally spiritually and physically Doug

2639
02:16:24,609 --> 02:16:29,739
would not be the same person without

2640
02:16:26,229 --> 02:16:31,269
medical marijuana I mean III saw some of

2641
02:16:29,739 --> 02:16:33,579
the same stuff I was going through in

2642
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:36,640
his world like I mean listeners if you

2643
02:16:33,579 --> 02:16:37,870
don't have a lot of pet like physical

2644
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:40,539
pain in your life or if you've never

2645
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:43,360
really been injured for a while it's

2646
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:45,580
kind of hard to understand what people

2647
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:47,770
who do have nerve damage and pain like

2648
02:16:45,579 --> 02:16:51,370
that go through and it's the best way I

2649
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:53,530
can describe it is it's like a sound and

2650
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:56,230
it gets louder and louder and louder and

2651
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:58,630
it gets louder the world around you gets

2652
02:16:56,229 --> 02:17:00,250
smaller and that sound presses in on the

2653
02:16:58,629 --> 02:17:01,848
world and there are some days where

2654
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:05,238
there's nothing but

2655
02:17:01,849 --> 02:17:06,799
sound like it's just pain it doesn't

2656
02:17:05,238 --> 02:17:08,568
matter that if you don't pick up the

2657
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:11,299
phone you're not gonna have a job later

2658
02:17:08,568 --> 02:17:12,978
it doesn't matter that you've got to go

2659
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:15,648
to the bathroom it doesn't matter that

2660
02:17:12,978 --> 02:17:17,388
you had something really important to do

2661
02:17:15,648 --> 02:17:19,968
that day that you have to get up and go

2662
02:17:17,388 --> 02:17:21,618
do now for or it's you know you're gonna

2663
02:17:19,968 --> 02:17:24,738
lose it forever it doesn't matter all

2664
02:17:21,619 --> 02:17:26,449
there is is the pain and you'll do

2665
02:17:24,738 --> 02:17:27,948
anything to get away from it or make it

2666
02:17:26,449 --> 02:17:30,050
stop for a while you'll give people

2667
02:17:27,949 --> 02:17:33,439
ridiculous homes of money because they

2668
02:17:30,049 --> 02:17:36,170
claim to have a treatment that works and

2669
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,760
for the most part nothing helps like I

2670
02:17:36,170 --> 02:17:40,369
was wearing a thing that electrocuted me

2671
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:43,670
slowly like a tens unit and it works

2672
02:17:40,369 --> 02:17:45,949
okay for some issues but for mine it was

2673
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:47,808
literally just an electrical shock that

2674
02:17:45,949 --> 02:17:49,880
scrambled the pain and pulse on the way

2675
02:17:47,808 --> 02:17:53,898
to my brain damn like that was the best

2676
02:17:49,879 --> 02:17:58,959
that Western science had for me and then

2677
02:17:53,898 --> 02:18:01,340
one day I hit some high CBD hash and

2678
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:04,250
about half an hour later I was like wait

2679
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:05,869
a second nothing hurts and I kind of

2680
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:07,010
drum my both my hands on the table when

2681
02:18:05,869 --> 02:18:09,319
I was like and I could feel all my

2682
02:18:07,010 --> 02:18:11,210
fingers and none of them hurt like what

2683
02:18:09,318 --> 02:18:15,558
is that where did that come from where'd

2684
02:18:11,209 --> 02:18:20,028
that guy with that vial of station yeah

2685
02:18:15,558 --> 02:18:21,618
it is absolutely wonderful and a lot of

2686
02:18:20,029 --> 02:18:23,479
people are starting to figure it out so

2687
02:18:21,619 --> 02:18:25,909
much so that there's a lot of scam and

2688
02:18:23,478 --> 02:18:28,368
fake [ __ ] around yeah unfortunately that

2689
02:18:25,908 --> 02:18:30,318
Chinese imported CBD [ __ ] it's not

2690
02:18:28,369 --> 02:18:34,399
you're not buying stuff with the lab

2691
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:35,898
tests on it from a very accredited

2692
02:18:34,398 --> 02:18:38,679
retailer you don't know what you're

2693
02:18:35,898 --> 02:18:43,099
getting I'm sorry to inform you oh yeah

2694
02:18:38,679 --> 02:18:46,119
unfortunately it's there's a lot of

2695
02:18:43,099 --> 02:18:48,648
research going on in to CBD right now

2696
02:18:46,119 --> 02:18:50,029
hopefully in the next ten years we know

2697
02:18:48,648 --> 02:18:53,090
a lot more about its medical

2698
02:18:50,029 --> 02:18:55,908
applications but I can vouch for its

2699
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:58,549
ability to calm a headache and lower

2700
02:18:55,908 --> 02:19:00,709
inflammation and swelling in your nerves

2701
02:18:58,549 --> 02:19:02,750
or around your nerves in your joints so

2702
02:19:00,709 --> 02:19:06,188
that those pain signals aren't just

2703
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:08,750
ability produces vomiting and nausea

2704
02:19:06,189 --> 02:19:10,639
smoke some CBD it'll take that away it

2705
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:12,429
suppresses seizures that's something

2706
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:15,049
we've talked about on the podcast before

2707
02:19:12,429 --> 02:19:16,069
it'll make you not have convulsions and

2708
02:19:15,049 --> 02:19:18,409
seizures hopefully

2709
02:19:16,069 --> 02:19:20,599
that's like the most Potter's everyone

2710
02:19:18,409 --> 02:19:21,760
but it's there's several different forms

2711
02:19:20,599 --> 02:19:25,040
of epileps

2712
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:29,020
that THC work on and that CBD work on

2713
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:29,020
and then that the two together work on

2714
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:36,889
stop doesn't stop it will slow down your

2715
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:43,909
PTSD and your nightmares and your

2716
02:19:36,888 --> 02:19:46,098
thoughts if you have PTSD amazing hopes

2717
02:19:43,909 --> 02:19:48,229
with anxiety that's an anti-inflammatory

2718
02:19:46,099 --> 02:19:50,329
we talked about that it's an anti an

2719
02:19:48,229 --> 02:19:52,129
antioxidant it helps with degenerative

2720
02:19:50,329 --> 02:19:54,409
disorders which is pretty cool it's act

2721
02:19:52,129 --> 02:19:56,750
as a protective enhancing tumor it'll

2722
02:19:54,409 --> 02:19:58,459
it'll it will not destroy your tumors I

2723
02:19:56,750 --> 02:20:01,489
think you need THC to destroy the two

2724
02:19:58,459 --> 02:20:05,959
layers slow a tumor for sure there's a

2725
02:20:01,489 --> 02:20:09,949
lot of very very very recent cancer

2726
02:20:05,959 --> 02:20:12,439
research on THC and CBD and CBD slows

2727
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:15,610
tumor growth majorly is what they're

2728
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:18,350
seeing in mice trials which is huge if

2729
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:20,750
if we can slow tumor growth that gives

2730
02:20:18,350 --> 02:20:22,640
us a better chance to fight it yes the

2731
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:25,780
good news to that court or that equation

2732
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:29,059
is that THC has been shown to kill it

2733
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:31,489
which is kinda the you know the the

2734
02:20:29,059 --> 02:20:34,250
first real medical research into Rick

2735
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:38,149
Simpson oil style products that would be

2736
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:42,739
it concentrates of both that's why those

2737
02:20:38,149 --> 02:20:44,600
are so effective I'm a little bit baked

2738
02:20:42,739 --> 02:20:46,909
from that last 90 dab I'm gonna take it

2739
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:48,440
down here and below that as the medical

2740
02:20:46,909 --> 02:20:50,569
research that we're starting to get I

2741
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:53,630
mean it really isn't it Symphony is

2742
02:20:50,569 --> 02:20:55,100
bitsy folks I'm not saying that if you

2743
02:20:53,629 --> 02:20:56,719
have cancer and you find some of this

2744
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:59,840
you can't cure yourself real easy that's

2745
02:20:56,719 --> 02:21:01,879
not what what I'm saying here but um the

2746
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:05,469
research is promising and honestly in

2747
02:21:01,879 --> 02:21:09,020
our lifetimes we might see legitimate

2748
02:21:05,469 --> 02:21:10,760
packaged perfectly dosed you've got this

2749
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:13,040
kind of cancer we're gonna start you on

2750
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:13,760
this much THC this much CBD style

2751
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,580
Trion's

2752
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:18,860
exactly in our lifetime which would be

2753
02:21:16,579 --> 02:21:20,479
oh that would make me so happy

2754
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:22,760
did you smell that dad that I just took

2755
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:24,469
a little bit oh that smells it tastes so

2756
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:27,000
good I tasted a minute ago that's the

2757
02:21:24,469 --> 02:21:29,429
turf ex pineapple Jack yeah

2758
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,500
chatter that was delicious yeah man

2759
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:34,200
another thing I wanted to mention that

2760
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:36,329
CBD does it's an antidepressant which

2761
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:38,340
you know I think it it's got its own

2762
02:21:36,329 --> 02:21:40,289
antidepressant properties but also if a

2763
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:41,818
dude's not hurting every day that's

2764
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:43,649
gonna work as an antidepressant if

2765
02:21:41,818 --> 02:21:45,269
you're not having PTSD symptoms and

2766
02:21:43,648 --> 02:21:45,988
panic attacks you're gonna be less

2767
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:48,569
depressed

2768
02:21:45,988 --> 02:21:50,609
I mean honestly most days when I wake up

2769
02:21:48,568 --> 02:21:51,059
and I'm not hurt and it feels like my

2770
02:21:50,609 --> 02:21:54,359
birthday

2771
02:21:51,059 --> 02:21:56,129
still cuz they're pretty rare most days

2772
02:21:54,359 --> 02:22:01,590
I wake up at least a little stiff a

2773
02:21:56,129 --> 02:22:03,509
little sore something somewhere I was a

2774
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:04,648
teenage more than one doctor go if you

2775
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:19,880
don't knock this [ __ ] off it's gonna

2776
02:22:04,648 --> 02:22:23,599
hurt yeah we were still free to like

2777
02:22:19,879 --> 02:22:23,599
before everything was nerfed

2778
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:38,460
in the future it was the last generation

2779
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:39,810
the relief got that but I remember more

2780
02:22:38,459 --> 02:22:41,879
than one doctor know it's gonna hurt

2781
02:22:39,809 --> 02:22:44,939
when you're thirty they were all right

2782
02:22:41,879 --> 02:22:48,059
it does but the days that are pain free

2783
02:22:44,939 --> 02:22:51,988
most of those I can accredit to last

2784
02:22:48,059 --> 02:22:55,318
night I was I was I knew whole lot of

2785
02:22:51,988 --> 02:22:58,318
THC concentrate instead of my normal mix

2786
02:22:55,318 --> 02:23:02,269
of predominately THC flour and shatter

2787
02:22:58,318 --> 02:23:08,100
and I wake up feeling a lot better

2788
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:10,290
really restful sleep and really really

2789
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:12,568
nice work on the inflammation while I

2790
02:23:10,290 --> 02:23:15,870
sleep one thing we should totally

2791
02:23:12,568 --> 02:23:18,269
mention to CBD buyers by itself will not

2792
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:20,399
get you high no you can consume a lot of

2793
02:23:18,270 --> 02:23:21,420
CBD and you may get a little grin but I

2794
02:23:20,398 --> 02:23:23,849
don't think you're gonna get like any

2795
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:27,540
psychedelic psychoactive effect it's not

2796
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:29,760
a high the mood improvement is like you

2797
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:32,580
were saying when the pain goes away your

2798
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,260
mood goes up a thousand times like it I

2799
02:23:32,579 --> 02:23:36,029
mean if you don't know what I'm talking

2800
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:37,559
about room think about getting a bee

2801
02:23:36,029 --> 02:23:39,720
sting when you get that dude stinger

2802
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:41,519
pulled out or a splinter pulled out

2803
02:23:39,719 --> 02:23:44,420
or you've got a big painful zit finally

2804
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:47,909
pops like in that relief of pressure

2805
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:49,529
imagine that like through your whole arm

2806
02:23:47,909 --> 02:23:51,898
like if your whole arm felt like it was

2807
02:23:49,529 --> 02:23:55,130
on fire and then one moment it stops

2808
02:23:51,898 --> 02:23:57,568
like that just felt like your arm again

2809
02:23:55,129 --> 02:23:59,938
the sensation is incredible when we

2810
02:23:57,568 --> 02:24:04,049
finally get there you know how well it's

2811
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:07,889
working another thing that we can talk

2812
02:24:04,049 --> 02:24:10,170
about is CBD will reduce the effects of

2813
02:24:07,889 --> 02:24:11,969
THC so if you're a little too high if

2814
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:14,129
you've had too many dads if you're new

2815
02:24:11,969 --> 02:24:15,599
and you take a big giant dab of THC and

2816
02:24:14,129 --> 02:24:17,969
you're just spinning you're [ __ ] up

2817
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:19,290
you take a little dab of CBD and it will

2818
02:24:17,969 --> 02:24:21,568
calm you down a little bit it'll balance

2819
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:23,220
out your high there's some company that

2820
02:24:21,568 --> 02:24:27,750
made a product they work on earth rescue

2821
02:24:23,219 --> 02:24:38,278
pills CBD filled joke app that's pretty

2822
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:40,139
cool yeah if your buddy took some

2823
02:24:38,279 --> 02:24:43,970
Doritos and he'd be just fine

2824
02:24:40,139 --> 02:24:52,049
a friend of mine makes for a relative

2825
02:24:43,969 --> 02:24:55,019
before he makes CBD capsules and I was

2826
02:24:52,049 --> 02:24:56,778
taking those I had a few and oh good

2827
02:24:55,020 --> 02:25:01,738
Lord that I feel wonderful

2828
02:24:56,779 --> 02:25:03,390
I'm just pain free and just in a really

2829
02:25:01,738 --> 02:25:05,189
really nice mood it was really nice

2830
02:25:03,389 --> 02:25:07,889
there are a couple of companies that are

2831
02:25:05,189 --> 02:25:09,210
making CBD dog treats which i think is

2832
02:25:07,889 --> 02:25:10,559
really cool because a lot of the

2833
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:13,019
Shepherd breeds are known for their

2834
02:25:10,559 --> 02:25:14,939
dysplasia and hip problems there's a

2835
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:16,560
shepherd dog that stayed at my house for

2836
02:25:14,939 --> 02:25:18,479
a little while now and he gets some CBD

2837
02:25:16,559 --> 02:25:20,100
treats occasionally and he seems to be a

2838
02:25:18,478 --> 02:25:21,389
happy little dog doesn't seem to cause

2839
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:22,979
him any problems and it's gonna keep him

2840
02:25:21,389 --> 02:25:27,959
pain-free keep his little hips happy

2841
02:25:22,978 --> 02:25:31,349
I've got a Malamute that's pushing for

2842
02:25:27,959 --> 02:25:34,438
13 and a half now she's almost 14 breed

2843
02:25:31,350 --> 02:25:37,140
expected life expectancy is 8 and so her

2844
02:25:34,439 --> 02:25:40,800
knees hurt her ankles are basically

2845
02:25:37,139 --> 02:25:42,299
every joint is shot and you can see when

2846
02:25:40,799 --> 02:25:44,608
she doesn't want to go up and down the

2847
02:25:42,299 --> 02:25:47,639
stairs I've been adding a little THC CBD

2848
02:25:44,609 --> 02:25:48,998
teen true to her food and the days that

2849
02:25:47,639 --> 02:25:51,948
I added she

2850
02:25:48,998 --> 02:25:55,248
nice you can see it helping with the

2851
02:25:51,949 --> 02:25:56,930
pain and inflammation ah it takes about

2852
02:25:55,248 --> 02:25:59,238
20 minutes half an hour to kick in for

2853
02:25:56,930 --> 02:26:02,119
her and you can see the change overnight

2854
02:25:59,238 --> 02:26:03,408
I had five or six customers come in

2855
02:26:02,119 --> 02:26:05,029
looking for something for their dogs

2856
02:26:03,408 --> 02:26:07,218
before I thought to try it and yeah I'm

2857
02:26:05,029 --> 02:26:09,649
glad I did there are companies that are

2858
02:26:07,218 --> 02:26:11,509
making specific edibles for dogs now if

2859
02:26:09,648 --> 02:26:13,338
there are things available at hem stores

2860
02:26:11,509 --> 02:26:14,779
that have CBD for your dogs that are

2861
02:26:13,338 --> 02:26:17,898
made in America with actual hemp

2862
02:26:14,779 --> 02:26:19,039
products there I can't say there's

2863
02:26:17,898 --> 02:26:20,930
anything wrong with that as long as it's

2864
02:26:19,039 --> 02:26:23,779
made with real real hemp or real

2865
02:26:20,930 --> 02:26:26,148
cannabis you're basically in a brick and

2866
02:26:23,779 --> 02:26:29,418
mortar retailer in the United States it

2867
02:26:26,148 --> 02:26:33,588
has to at least contain what the label

2868
02:26:29,418 --> 02:26:35,119
says recently the the DEA just scented a

2869
02:26:33,588 --> 02:26:38,209
thing to a bunch of the CBD only

2870
02:26:35,119 --> 02:26:39,799
companies in the internet kind of

2871
02:26:38,209 --> 02:26:42,168
freaked out was like oh they're just

2872
02:26:39,799 --> 02:26:43,640
attacking weed like they always do it

2873
02:26:42,168 --> 02:26:45,439
was they were targeting the people that

2874
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:47,478
are selling like cod fish oil and

2875
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:49,309
calling a CBD oil because people don't

2876
02:26:47,478 --> 02:26:50,809
know any better and you can't take this

2877
02:26:49,309 --> 02:26:53,568
stuff to a lab and get it tested as a

2878
02:26:50,809 --> 02:26:55,100
civilian yeah you're just getting

2879
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:56,509
scammed out of money on the internet so

2880
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:59,959
be careful if you're ordering online

2881
02:26:56,509 --> 02:27:01,759
folks with this the if you've got a

2882
02:26:59,959 --> 02:27:03,739
number of different ailments

2883
02:27:01,759 --> 02:27:05,689
you should get online and check out to

2884
02:27:03,738 --> 02:27:07,338
see if there's any research on what THC

2885
02:27:05,689 --> 02:27:09,259
and CBD can do for those for your

2886
02:27:07,338 --> 02:27:11,209
specific ailment yeah and then check out

2887
02:27:09,259 --> 02:27:13,158
the laws in your state and see if and

2888
02:27:11,209 --> 02:27:15,020
where you can get this stuff if you have

2889
02:27:13,158 --> 02:27:17,359
to come take a vacation in Colorado I

2890
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:19,578
see a lot of the people doing exactly

2891
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:23,059
that they come they visit at one of our

2892
02:27:19,578 --> 02:27:25,609
rec stores and a good rec store will

2893
02:27:23,059 --> 02:27:28,788
have a decent selection of CBD products

2894
02:27:25,609 --> 02:27:30,859
at this point they might not have a huge

2895
02:27:28,789 --> 02:27:32,748
selection or a wide selection but they

2896
02:27:30,859 --> 02:27:36,140
should have some you can go to more than

2897
02:27:32,748 --> 02:27:37,998
one store water here so you'll check out

2898
02:27:36,139 --> 02:27:39,738
weed maps you can check out Leafly there

2899
02:27:37,998 --> 02:27:41,270
are menus available to see what you want

2900
02:27:39,738 --> 02:27:44,748
unfortunately on the mobile apps they

2901
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:46,279
cannot show you pricing anymore all the

2902
02:27:44,748 --> 02:27:47,600
pricing has gone on all the mobile apps

2903
02:27:46,279 --> 02:27:50,658
but you can still find them on the web

2904
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:54,408

locations that have them don't get mad

2917
02:28:11,969 --> 02:28:17,519
at me if a dispensary does not update

2918
02:28:13,770 --> 02:28:19,860
their weed maps menu sometimes they like

2919
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:21,960
weed maps and Leafly are great places to

2920
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:25,560
start your search but if you're looking

2921
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:26,969
for a very specific product or even kind

2922
02:28:25,559 --> 02:28:28,920
of a general product you're looking for

2923
02:28:26,969 --> 02:28:31,319
something with a certain ratio of

2924
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:32,189
cannabinoid some THC some CBD something

2925
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:34,680
like that

2926
02:28:32,189 --> 02:28:36,450
check out weed Maps release we make a

2927
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:37,380
list of possible shops and then go ahead

2928
02:28:36,450 --> 02:28:40,229
and give them a call

2929
02:28:37,379 --> 02:28:43,109
and just real quick ask oh hey what's

2930
02:28:40,228 --> 02:28:45,359

02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:50,159
ya black-dick pens yeah but like be

2933
02:28:48,149 --> 02:28:53,969
specific in what you're looking for as

2934
02:28:50,159 --> 02:28:56,069
much as you can and then narrow your

2935
02:28:53,969 --> 02:28:58,469
list that way because I mean the

2936
02:28:56,069 --> 02:28:59,909
industry is weird right now and you

2937
02:28:58,469 --> 02:29:02,728
never know when somebody's gonna walk in

2938
02:28:59,909 --> 02:29:04,590
and so it gives me all of that so what's

2939
02:29:02,728 --> 02:29:05,849
on their menu might not have anything to

2940
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:08,040
do with what's on their store shelf and

2941
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:09,210
right this moment it might just be stuff

2942
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,250
that's been on the store shelf in the

2943
02:29:09,209 --> 02:29:12,329
last 30 days I was shopping at Green and

2944
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:15,209
healthy the other day and I was

2945
02:29:12,329 --> 02:29:16,709
frustrated because I wanted I bought

2946
02:29:15,209 --> 02:29:18,688
something and the guy behind me was

2947
02:29:16,709 --> 02:29:22,349
frustrated because I had purchased all

2948
02:29:18,689 --> 02:29:23,639
of it and he said I want that and she

2949
02:29:22,350 --> 02:29:25,229
had to say it's gone and he said why is

2950
02:29:23,639 --> 02:29:27,180
it on the list and she's like he just

2951
02:29:25,228 --> 02:29:28,529
bought all of it sorry so that's how

2952
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:29,790
quickly she can sell out I bought her

2953
02:29:28,530 --> 02:29:32,520
notes and I cleaned him out I took the

2954
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:34,880
bottom of that I watched a dude by 160

2955
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:37,649
things are hard candies once I'm Jesus

2956
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:41,399
it was just like okay let me get you a

2957
02:29:37,649 --> 02:29:45,869
box and sweep all of these into the box

2958
02:29:41,399 --> 02:29:47,340
and like for the people sorry we're out

2959
02:29:45,870 --> 02:29:48,360
of that particular product line and

2960
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:52,620
there were likes there's something wrong

2961
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:54,329
with it something amazing with it

2962
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:55,829
currently honestly every every month

2963
02:29:54,329 --> 02:29:57,360
I've worked in a dispensary that's

2964
02:29:55,829 --> 02:29:59,639
happened with at least one product line

2965
02:29:57,360 --> 02:30:01,110
once I mean sometimes it's only the last

2966
02:29:59,639 --> 02:30:03,959
eight or ten or twenty units or whatever

2967
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:05,729
but it happens well I used to go to you

2968
02:30:03,959 --> 02:30:08,129
went with me we went to the clinic in

2969
02:30:05,728 --> 02:30:11,250
Denver and they had Durbin poison wax if

2970
02:30:08,129 --> 02:30:11,659
and they had vortex wax I loved from the

2971
02:30:11,250 --> 02:30:14,239
clinic

2972
02:30:11,659 --> 02:30:15,200
on Mexico in Denver it's still open they

2973
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:16,489
don't have these products anymore

2974
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:21,979
they've changed their game but they used

2975
02:30:16,489 --> 02:30:24,648
to have the vortex tasted like

2976
02:30:21,978 --> 02:30:26,239
cranberries and dirty feet and rotten

2977
02:30:24,648 --> 02:30:28,250
fruit I don't know why you liked that

2978
02:30:26,239 --> 02:30:30,319
feet smell oh man I just loved that in

2979
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:32,148
my weed but the high that he gave me I

2980
02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:34,069
couldn't focus on anything it made my

2981
02:30:32,148 --> 02:30:37,430
eyes jump around like I was on a bumpy

2982
02:30:34,069 --> 02:30:39,139
road it was really crazy that durbin

2983
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:40,670
poison just I love the flavor a good

2984
02:30:39,139 --> 02:30:42,559
urban poison wax and that head-high is

2985
02:30:40,670 --> 02:30:44,569
just so amazing so back in the day we'd

2986
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:46,189
go to the clinic and I would save up as

2987
02:30:44,569 --> 02:30:47,270
much money as I can afford to save up

2988
02:30:46,189 --> 02:30:48,559
and I'd walk in there and I'd say how

2989
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:50,000
much did that Durbin poison do you have

2990
02:30:48,559 --> 02:30:52,100
and they'd say there's about 14 grams

2991
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,659
and I'd say I'll take it and then I'd

2992
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:54,770
say how much did that vortex do you have

2993
02:30:53,659 --> 02:30:57,799
and they usually have somewhere between

2994
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:59,149
14 and 28 grams I would buy it I would

2995
02:30:57,799 --> 02:31:00,379
clean it out the guy behind me would be

2996
02:30:59,148 --> 02:31:01,819
like oh yeah he bought a lot of that I

2997
02:31:00,379 --> 02:31:03,199
want something they'd be like sorry he

2998
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:05,000
bought all of it

2999
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:07,370
yeah I did it the other day with those

3000
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:12,978
delicious truffles I uh they cut me off

3001
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:15,410
eventually hours away from my house at

3002
02:31:12,978 --> 02:31:17,389

future about sativa and indica and the

3026
02:32:46,189 --> 02:32:49,668
differences and the benefits and

3027
02:32:47,779 --> 02:32:50,838

3028

3033
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:24,049
difference between strain and strand

3034
02:33:19,809 --> 02:33:26,328
strands are ropes or fibers strains are

3035
02:33:24,049 --> 02:33:27,499
different varieties of cannabis if you

3036
02:33:26,328 --> 02:33:30,680
want to be technical you can call it a

3037
02:33:27,498 --> 02:33:32,869
varietal or a cultivar but let's let's

3038
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:35,869
go with strain instead of strand as a

3039
02:33:32,869 --> 02:33:51,709
start you guys it's trichome and not

3040

3071
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:51,470
[ __ ] up where he said it's good to use

3072
02:35:49,851 --> 02:35:53,001
before and after the fight he shouldn't

3073
02:35:51,470 --> 02:35:55,130
I said before the fight [ __ ] up right

3074
02:35:53,001 --> 02:35:57,591
there buddy but still well there there's

3075
02:35:55,130 --> 02:35:59,479
he might be in a trouble for doing that

3076
02:35:57,591 --> 02:36:01,790
yeah that's that's what I wanted to talk

3077
02:35:59,479 --> 02:36:05,841
about I'm glad you said that it's the

3078
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:11,230
specific rules bar cannabis consumption

3079
02:36:05,841 --> 02:36:14,450
period until six hours after the fight

3080
02:36:11,229 --> 02:36:16,039
is what I was reading in random press

3081
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:18,051
coverage of this I like I don't follow

3082
02:36:16,040 --> 02:36:20,301
the sports make sense in all their rules

3083
02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:22,310
catch that from my intro to this story

3084
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:25,729
is that you sorrow rules or is that

3085
02:36:22,310 --> 02:36:29,100
rules from the local governing sporting

3086
02:36:25,729 --> 02:36:38,459
agency lose rules with an S

3087
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:40,439
a fighter's can't use any sort of

3088
02:36:38,459 --> 02:36:42,509
cannabis product until or any sort of

3089
02:36:40,439 --> 02:36:44,040
banned substance which marijuana or

3090
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:45,988
cannabis products would be on the list

3091
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:47,430
until six hours after the fight I'm

3092
02:36:45,988 --> 02:36:49,049
pretty sure I already know your answer

3093
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:50,908
here but do you think a dude that just

3094
02:36:49,049 --> 02:36:53,068
spent twenty five minutes of his night

3095
02:36:50,908 --> 02:36:54,840
getting kicked in the dick and punched

3096
02:36:53,068 --> 02:36:56,850
in the face should be allowed to take a

3097
02:36:54,840 --> 02:37:00,770
couple of rips off a CBD vape pen at the

3098
02:36:56,850 --> 02:37:00,770
end of the night almost the most surely

3099
02:37:01,430 --> 02:37:04,520
[Music]

3100
02:37:06,529 --> 02:37:10,500
anything that's gonna help you recover

3101
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:13,738
faster and deal with that level of

3102
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:15,959
trauma is encouraged by me

3103
02:37:13,738 --> 02:37:17,698
reduces inflammation and swelling and

3104
02:37:15,959 --> 02:37:20,988
that dude the his face looked like a

3105
02:37:17,699 --> 02:37:23,880
jack-o'-lantern it did and honestly I

3106
02:37:20,988 --> 02:37:29,100
incur a plot his use of anything other

3107
02:37:23,879 --> 02:37:31,318
than heavy narcotics is usually you know

3108
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:33,479
I don't know what they do to deal with

3109
02:37:31,318 --> 02:37:34,978
the pain at the end of that but I need

3110
02:37:33,478 --> 02:37:37,500
Diaz did make a joke he said I'm going

3111
02:37:34,978 --> 02:37:38,519
to a party and Conor McGregor is going

3112
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:41,639
to the hospital I don't know how

3113
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:44,640
accurate that was because his face

3114
02:37:41,639 --> 02:37:45,898
punched in I can't even talk about who I

3115
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:47,818
feel like won that fight that doesn't

3116
02:37:45,898 --> 02:37:50,488
matter at all in this podcast that's not

3117
02:37:47,818 --> 02:37:53,219
what we're here for all I know is that

3118
02:37:50,488 --> 02:37:55,170
Nate Diaz took a hell of a beating and

3119
02:37:53,219 --> 02:37:57,299
that during the press conference he was

3120
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:58,590
ripping a Seabee dgn blatantly ripping

3121
02:37:57,299 --> 02:38:01,769
it - he looked took like two or three

3122
02:37:58,590 --> 02:38:18,210
big fat rips off of it so he didn't

3123
02:38:01,770 --> 02:38:21,210
cough like I do yeah yeah they call him

3124
02:38:18,209 --> 02:38:24,028
young wheezy so I feel like this dude

3125
02:38:21,209 --> 02:38:25,589
should I think I feel like every athlete

3126
02:38:24,029 --> 02:38:27,569
feel like almost everybody should be

3127
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:31,469
allowed to consume everybody why not

3128
02:38:27,568 --> 02:38:34,140
let's see dick it was about last night

3129
02:38:31,469 --> 02:38:38,199
the new episode that aired was

3130
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:41,229
medical marijuana use in the NFL to deal

3131
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:43,061
with the chronic concussion syndrome or

3132
02:38:41,229 --> 02:38:46,149
whatever it's called no one helps I'm a

3133
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:48,310
victim of a head injury and I know we

3134
02:38:46,149 --> 02:38:50,920
talked about that 42 minutes ago

3135
02:38:48,310 --> 02:38:52,869
yep that definitely that CBD changed my

3136
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:56,170
life and it helped me get out of my funk

3137
02:38:52,870 --> 02:38:57,730
that I had focused on CBD but that's

3138
02:38:56,170 --> 02:38:58,989
sort of what they were interesting that

3139
02:38:57,729 --> 02:38:59,680
is a part of the story that were telling

3140
02:38:58,989 --> 02:39:03,280
was

3141
02:38:59,681 --> 02:39:05,079
THC CBD oil protects my next question

3142
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:10,500
was gonna be do you think that cannabis

3143
02:39:05,079 --> 02:39:15,761
use is a performance-enhancing drugs

3144
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:16,690
performance by people fighting UFC

3145
02:39:15,761 --> 02:39:19,750
fighting how about football

3146
02:39:16,690 --> 02:39:22,149
no not performance-enhancing at all how

3147
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:25,569
about recovery enhancing how about

3148
02:39:22,149 --> 02:39:27,819
basketball no I'm trying to play devil's

3149
02:39:25,569 --> 02:39:36,720
advocate here how about video games yeah

3150
02:39:27,819 --> 02:39:39,670
yeah I feel like when I smoke in my mind

3151
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:40,869
since I am so comfortable I've got a TD

3152
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:42,159
my mind wanders you can tell by

3153
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:44,641
listening to the podcast my mind is

3154
02:39:42,159 --> 02:39:46,989
[ __ ] starts around all over the place

3155
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:48,699
when I smoke some hash it does help me

3156
02:39:46,989 --> 02:39:50,229
focus a little bit there's a moment

3157
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:51,790
there for the first 5-10 minutes where

3158
02:39:50,229 --> 02:39:54,550
my brain just spins but once it lands

3159
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:57,761
back in its place I'm pretty well

3160
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:58,869
focused and so I mean I've got mild ATD

3161
02:39:57,761 --> 02:40:00,640
as well and that's one of the things

3162
02:39:58,870 --> 02:40:06,521
I've always enjoyed about cannabis is it

3163
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:08,591
helps slow down the pool better I could

3164
02:40:06,521 --> 02:40:09,880
shoot basketball better I can probably I

3165
02:40:08,591 --> 02:40:12,700
don't play football I could probably

3166
02:40:09,879 --> 02:40:16,060
throw my football with more accuracy

3167
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:18,761
after I took a couple of dabs ah I'm a

3168
02:40:16,060 --> 02:40:20,829
musician I've played drums for 20 years

3169
02:40:18,761 --> 02:40:22,301
I've had drum lessons I've been on tour

3170
02:40:20,829 --> 02:40:25,060
I've played in big bands I played in

3171
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:26,289
small bands sometimes smoking a little

3172
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:28,149
weed makes me play a little better

3173
02:40:26,290 --> 02:40:29,681
sometimes smoke a little weed [ __ ] me

3174
02:40:28,149 --> 02:40:32,800
up to tell you the truth so I don't know

3175
02:40:29,681 --> 02:40:36,521
how alters unless you're talking about

3176
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:38,920
like just helping the D athlete of the

3177
02:40:36,521 --> 02:40:42,091
performer - now other distractions and

3178
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:45,450
focus on the competition in the moment I

3179
02:40:42,091 --> 02:40:46,979
don't see it you know making you run

3180
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:48,420
faster jump higher and that's what I

3181
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:51,239
think of when I write performance and

3182
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:54,210
answer yourself full of blood so that

3183
02:40:51,239 --> 02:40:56,129
your heart can move more oxygen more

3184
02:40:54,209 --> 02:40:58,500
testosterone so I'm faster meaner leaner

3185
02:40:56,129 --> 02:41:02,509
quicker right yes steroids so that you

3186
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:05,700
have more physical muscle mass but like

3187
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:07,590
able to kick you in the face any harder

3188
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:09,900
it doesn't make me give you more damn it

3189
02:41:07,590 --> 02:41:12,810
helps me recover from that face kick

3190
02:41:09,899 --> 02:41:15,140
faster but like that's not a performance

3191
02:41:12,810 --> 02:41:21,619
enhancer that's the recovery enhancer

3192
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:42,299
that's very different for the music

3193
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:43,860
they're got these long chicken legs and

3194
02:41:42,299 --> 02:41:45,359
they come out and I cross them Jeff you

3195
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:47,790
got to fight in 30 seconds you ready for

3196
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:49,260
your pre-show dab let's get it and they

3197
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:51,181
drop me like a half a gram of some

3198
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:53,159
pineapple jack nut run shatter on there

3199
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:58,739
and I blow it out you know what I want

3200
02:41:53,159 --> 02:42:04,459
to do after that not fight how do you

3201
02:41:58,739 --> 02:42:06,840
want to fight at all no I'm just watch

3202
02:42:04,459 --> 02:42:09,149
you couldn't manipulate no you can

3203
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:11,729
manipulate the rake huh because if they

3204
02:42:09,149 --> 02:42:15,840
need their fingers to grapple I was

3205
02:42:11,729 --> 02:42:17,520
thinking boxing style you've got one

3206
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,960
manager holding up the smoke buddy one

3207
02:42:17,521 --> 02:42:20,641
manager holding up the rig another

3208
02:42:18,959 --> 02:42:23,250
manager working the nail on the car cap

3209
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:25,500
yeah this seems complicated for a free

3210
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:28,229
flight that I would use one of those the

3211
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:30,431
hinge nails

3212
02:42:28,229 --> 02:42:31,869
so you do one hand I can do with my

3213
02:42:30,431 --> 02:42:33,790
glove on I figure this out the

3214
02:42:31,870 --> 02:42:36,250
announcers microphone comes down Geoff's

3215
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:37,961
rig comes down I am one of these guys if

3216
02:42:36,250 --> 02:42:42,851
there's a dab to be taken I will make

3217
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:44,470
sure that's awesome I'm glad we got to

3218
02:42:42,851 --> 02:42:49,780
work the Nate Diaz clip into this

3219
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:51,819
episode that was photoshopped I click to

3220
02:42:49,780 --> 02:43:04,841
follow him on it and they start talking

3221
02:42:51,819 --> 02:43:14,140
about it away proud to lead the way

3222
02:43:04,841 --> 02:43:16,091
about politically correct or gentle the

3223
02:43:14,140 --> 02:43:17,800
[ __ ] head I'm gonna smoke some CBD to

3224
02:43:16,091 --> 02:43:20,351
help it out it's gonna help don't be mad

3225
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:21,399
at me that's cool I like that but both

3226
02:43:20,351 --> 02:43:22,961
of those brothers are gonna end up

3227
02:43:21,399 --> 02:43:24,369
banned from the UFC and banned from

3228
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:25,449
fighting for life if they keep playing

3229
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:26,650
the way that they do and that's gonna be

3230
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:31,329
terrible because I like to see their

3231
02:43:26,649 --> 02:43:33,220
performances large hippie Rastafari and

3232
02:43:31,329 --> 02:43:34,899
dude but I love to watch some UFC I

3233
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:36,520
think about it this way those dudes

3234
02:43:34,899 --> 02:43:38,440
weigh 200 pounds they're [ __ ] jack

3235
02:43:36,521 --> 02:43:39,909
they've got more testosterone and then

3236
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:41,381
their body but most people should have

3237
02:43:39,909 --> 02:43:42,700
and they want a break [ __ ] I'm glad that

3238
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:44,949
they're in that cage breaking each other

3239
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:48,101
then out at the bar or at the dad lounge

3240
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:49,570
trying to break me if I condone that go

3241
02:43:48,101 --> 02:43:51,671
to battle in that cage let's see it

3242
02:43:49,569 --> 02:43:54,431
that's cool that's skill jujitsu we've

3243
02:43:51,671 --> 02:43:57,640
both known people who were just built to

3244
02:43:54,431 --> 02:43:58,989
brawl yeah that's just yes some people

3245
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:00,489
are here to drum some people are here to

3246
02:43:58,989 --> 02:44:04,060
high-five some people are here to brawl

3247
02:44:00,489 --> 02:44:08,619
we've all got our skill and it's good

3248
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:11,560
that they have an outlet and I'm a fan I

3249
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:13,841
think I am accidentally an MMA fan

3250
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:21,819
because of Joe Rogan and because of Joey

3251
02:44:13,841 --> 02:44:23,739
Diaz and it's out the fight companion

3252
02:44:21,819 --> 02:44:25,569
tour him and a bunch of his friends and

3253
02:44:23,739 --> 02:44:27,399
I also listen to find her in the kids so

3254
02:44:25,569 --> 02:44:28,989
that's more MMA that gets pumped into my

3255
02:44:27,399 --> 02:44:30,399
head but they put out a fight companion

3256
02:44:28,989 --> 02:44:32,110
where two guys from Fighter and the kid

3257
02:44:30,399 --> 02:44:34,149
and Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan sit around

3258
02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:35,500
and they watch the UFC and they talk

3259
02:44:34,149 --> 02:44:36,761
about what's going on they drink beer

3260
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:38,079
and smoke weed and get [ __ ] up and

3261
02:44:36,761 --> 02:44:40,271
talk [ __ ] to each other but they're

3262
02:44:38,079 --> 02:44:41,110
watching the UFC and they tell you like

3263
02:44:40,271 --> 02:44:43,239
in the

3264
02:44:41,110 --> 02:44:46,300
like all right round three of this match

3265
02:44:43,239 --> 02:44:48,100
we're at 29 28 27 seconds and you can

3266
02:44:46,299 --> 02:44:50,739
sync up your computer and watch that

3267
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:51,970
video and so it's almost weirdly like

3268
02:44:50,739 --> 02:44:54,340
you're hanging out with Rogan and the

3269
02:44:51,969 --> 02:44:56,109
crew watching the fight i watch it if

3270
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:58,989
it's on somewhere I'm at but I don't

3271
02:44:56,110 --> 02:45:00,430
like actively pay attention yeah I pay

3272
02:44:58,989 --> 02:45:02,530
more like if I'm over at your house and

3273
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:04,239
it's on it'll get more attention out of

3274
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:07,900
me than like football or basketball and

3275
02:45:04,239 --> 02:45:08,949
I took a little karate when I was a

3276
02:45:07,899 --> 02:45:11,409
youngster so I've always been fascinated

3277
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:13,390
with that type of skills to conclude

3278
02:45:11,409 --> 02:45:14,739
Santu for several years and then go

3279
02:45:13,389 --> 02:45:27,609
karate for even longer

3280
02:45:14,739 --> 02:45:29,170
I was just rip it on some CBD oil took

3281
02:45:27,610 --> 02:45:30,760
like two or three good maybe three or

3282
02:45:29,170 --> 02:45:32,110
four good rips all right like we've been

3283
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:33,370
rambling for almost an hour I think it's

3284
02:45:32,110 --> 02:45:39,819
time to wrap up this show what do you

3285
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:42,700
think I crossed out all the stuff on my

3286
02:45:39,819 --> 02:45:45,129
list except popular CBD strains so that

3287
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:48,070
if people wanted to grow cannabis that

3288
02:45:45,129 --> 02:45:51,670
was high in CBD just a few strains I

3289
02:45:48,069 --> 02:45:56,860
would recommend anything Harlequin canna

3290
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:58,899
tonic Taurus ooh Tora Bora ac/dc the

3291
02:45:56,860 --> 02:46:00,880
Tora Bora is really wonderful folks that

3292
02:45:58,899 --> 02:46:02,199
I've had a lot of personally and I know

3293
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:03,489
I went over that list really quickly

3294
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:05,350
those were just off the top of my house

3295
02:46:03,489 --> 02:46:09,280
the other thing I'd like to touch and I

3296
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:11,050
think before we wrap this one up is for

3297
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:14,220
at least for the pain and inflammation

3298
02:46:11,049 --> 02:46:19,659
that I'm dealing with THC and CBD

3299
02:46:14,219 --> 02:46:22,479
together in roughly 50/50 mix work two

3300
02:46:19,659 --> 02:46:26,649
or three hundred times better then CBD

3301
02:46:22,479 --> 02:46:28,989
alone or THC alone the two of them

3302
02:46:26,649 --> 02:46:31,539
together works it's not one plus one

3303
02:46:28,989 --> 02:46:34,209
equals two it's one plus one equals

3304
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:37,300
seven as far as I'm concerned the effect

3305
02:46:34,209 --> 02:46:39,339
is amplified greatly cool last man no

3306
02:46:37,299 --> 02:46:41,560
it's wonderful when you when you mix THC

3307
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:43,930
and CBD the medical applications are

3308
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:46,840
wonderful I'm sorry if I sound a little

3309
02:46:43,930 --> 02:46:49,569
stone and I am pretty tired but I feel

3310
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:51,639
clear-headed I feel like alert and

3311
02:46:49,569 --> 02:46:53,100
president we're gonna wasn't true when I

3312
02:46:51,639 --> 02:46:55,318
got here I was hurting so

3313
02:46:53,100 --> 02:46:56,760
I I seriously almost didn't come folks

3314
02:46:55,318 --> 02:46:57,809
and I really like it and I didn't almost

3315
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:59,430
didn't come because my head was down

3316
02:46:57,809 --> 02:47:00,959
then I'm glad you made it glad you

3317
02:46:59,430 --> 02:47:02,488
