00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,758
while uh while i had kovit i was

166
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,319
basically face down either in bed or on

167
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,639
a couch for about 11 days i would get up

168
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,079
to go pee uh then i would get back on

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,680
the couch i'd eat as much food as my

170
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,000
body would allow me to have which wasn't

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
much then i would try to find the couch

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,519
and the air conditioner i was so hot

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
that i thought i was gonna die couldn't

174
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,399
function i got dizzy every time i stood

175
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,478
up that is gone now but um what i wanted

176
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
to talk about today is do you have some

177
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,599
sort of a backup plan i don't want you

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
to get coveted i don't want you to get

179
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
sick i don't want anything bad to happen

180
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,839
to you but it is possible i don't want

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,879
those things to happen to me but it did

182
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,758
i was

183
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,199
very minimally uh able to work in my

184
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,879
garden for the time that i was sick

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
there was a two-week period where it was

186
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,159
just kind of like [ __ ] it if the plants

187
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
live they live if they die they die that

188
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,439
was my attitude i know a lot of you guys

189
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
are probably cringing hearing that

190
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,399
that's how sick i was i did not care if

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
the plants that operate my business

192
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,079
lived or died i do care deeply about

193
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
that but i was so sick that it was like

194
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,879
go stand up and water those plants and i

195
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
would stand up and i feel like i was

196
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,639
spinning in circles and wanted to throw

197
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,159
up and do back flips i didn't want to do

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
the back flips my brain was doing

199
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
backflips so i couldn't really take care

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
of the garden now my question is do you

201
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,399
have a backup plan is there somebody in

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,879
your circle your life hopefully within

203
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,478
your home possibly maybe they can water

204
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,360
or wherever your grow is they can water

205
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,199
your growth for you should you get sick

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
injured have to go away for a couple of

207
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
days maybe you get a job opportunity you

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
got to take off maybe fish comes you got

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,879
to go for four or five days and be away

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,399
do you have some sort of a back-up plan

211
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,399
is there somebody that can water those

212
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,399
plants for you does that person know how

213
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,879
to adjust and check ph do they know how

214
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,519
to mix nutrients maybe now is a good

215
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,519
time to think about who would i call if

216
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,519
i do have to go out of town who would i

217
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,000
call if i do get sick because i always

218
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,079
preach especially in illegal red state

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,639
areas i always preach shut up don't tell

220
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,478
anybody about your grow but do you have

221
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
one person that you can trust with your

222
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,519
growth luckily i've got a i've been in

223
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
this town for a long time i have a lot

224
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,359
of great friends a lot of family i've

225
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,959
got one or two people i can uh heavily

226
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
rely on to take care of a garden if

227
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,879
things do go completely wrong for me

228
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,959
i've got people i can give instructions

229
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,560
to and i can help them out plus there's

230
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,000
cameras in there so i can guide them by

231
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
using the cameras and we have facetime

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,478
now but do you have somebody in your

233
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,399
immediate area that can come help you if

234
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,159
you are going to have a problem it's got

235
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,000
to be somebody that you trust but also

236
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
somebody that you know is going to

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,439
follow the instructions but also

238
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
somebody that when they mess it up

239
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,839
you know how you're going to be able to

240
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
handle being mad at them because you

241
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,598
might be super pissed if this person

242
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,680
accidentally ruins your garden so do you

243
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,519
have a backup for sick days do you have

244
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
an auto watering system do you have

245
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,560
somebody that can come in and water for

246
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
you if you do have that auto water

247
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
system it's going to need to be refilled

248
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
eventually those shouldn't go for more

249
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,639
than a week maybe 14 days at the most

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,240
to the best of my knowledge if you're if

251
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
you've got water sitting in a reservoir

252
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
you don't want that there for too long

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
especially if it's got nutrients in it

254
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,560
even if it's moving still in my opinion

255
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
you're going to want that changed out

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,799
eventually does that person know how to

257
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,679
change that water for you how to

258
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,838
replenish refresh replenish and or and

259
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,359
or i'm going to not even edit that look

260
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,240
i'm human you guys does that person know

261
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,918
how to replenish and or refill your

262
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
reservoir that was harder to say than it

263
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,399
looked geez

264
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,399
all right let me get myself back on

265
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,639
track uh also

266
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,919
do you have somebody i don't want you to

267
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,919
get hurt i don't want you to get sick

268
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,679
but [ __ ] does happen this is the reality

269
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,759
do you have somebody that you can call

270
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,479
if you are to get hurt in your grow

271
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,240
especially in an illegal place or maybe

272
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
you don't want anybody maybe you just

273
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
don't need paramedics and cops there

274
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,120
maybe you're working in the garden you

275
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,879
poke yourself in the eye maybe you get

276
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,879
something in the eye maybe you cut your

277
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,879
finger and you just need some help do

278
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,159
you have somebody that you can call do

279
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,919
you have a way that you can do that

280
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,360
maybe if you get some [ __ ] in your eyes

281
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,439
this has really happened to somebody

282
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,759
that i know he told me the story he got

283
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
ph down in his eyes while mixing a

284
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,159
reservoir he was blind he could not see

285
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,920
a [ __ ] thing he was in an illegal

286
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,519
area allegedly growing illegally

287
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,719
allegedly it's all a fictional character

288
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
you can't do anything about a guy you

289
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
don't know who he is anyway this dude

290
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
had ph down in his eyes and could not

291
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
figure out how to work his phone because

292
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,838
he was blind luckily he was able to hold

293
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,679
the phone up and say hey siri and then

294
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
he was able to call one of his family

295
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,879
members who lived nearby who was able to

296
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,159
come and help him i just activated siri

297
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,639
on my phone i was afraid that would

298
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,000
happen but he used the hey siri feature

299
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,759
and then he called a family member they

300
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
came and helped him out do you have

301
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,039
something like that set up is there

302
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,879
somebody that knows about your grow that

303
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,719
if you call and you say hey i need some

304
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,000
help you can say it discreetly over the

305
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
phone and they know what you're talking

306
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
about they can come help you out that

307
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,278
may be beneficial to you if you are in

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
some sort of a

309
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,958
prohibition area have somebody that can

310
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
back you up all the time even if you are

311
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,078
not in a prohibition area because [ __ ]

312
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
does go wrong now speaking of having

313
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,439
backups i recently experienced a power

314
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,919
outage the uh the transformer uh near

315
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
where my grow is located exploded it

316
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,639
seriously [ __ ] exploded there was no

317
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,799
power for about 18 hours uh do you have

318
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,278
a backup plan for no power do you have a

319
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,559
generator do you have some sort of idea

320
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,078
of how to get out of the grow if the

321
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,919
lights go dark because i've been in the

322
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,278
grow and the power goes out and it's

323
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,958
completely dark in there if i didn't

324
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,399
have my cell phone or most of the time i

325
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,759
carry a little pocket flashlight these

326
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,039
days if i didn't have one of those

327
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,879
devices i would have been [ __ ] out of

328
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,078
luck and stuck in that grow would not

329
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,439
have been able to find my way out i

330
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,719
thought i would have tripped over things

331
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
broke a bunch of [ __ ] that could have

332
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
gone terribly wrong for me so do you

333
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,199
have some sort of power backup in there

334
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,559
do you have a battery-powered light they

335
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
sell these little lights at all the

336
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,399
plastic stores the stores that sell the

337
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,679
plastic [ __ ] um it looks one of them

338
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,078
looks like a light switch and you

339
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,120
actually can uh just glue it or tape it

340
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,479
to the wall it's got its own self

341
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,679
adhesive on the back and it sticks to

342
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,278
the wall it's a light switch when you

343
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,958
flip it up the light comes on when you

344
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,159
switch it down the light goes off it is

345
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,599
battery powered that way if the

346
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,360
electricity goes out it's still got a

347
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
battery in there you can use that flip

348
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,240
that on maybe find your way out of the

349
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,078
grower or something like that they also

350
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
sell some that are just little domes you

351
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,039
tap them and they come on you tap them

352
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
and they go off i'm sure you've seen

353
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,278
them on tv they're as seen on tv sort of

354
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,200
items like i said they sell those at all

355
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,120
the plastic stores or maybe just get

356
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,959
yourself a little carry flashlight or a

357
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,639
lot of us have our cell phone already

358
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,199
but have some sort of light in case the

359
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,199
power does go out in there then

360
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
do you know an electrician or have an

361
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
electrician friend or somebody that at

362
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,359
least knows a little bit about

363
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
electrical and wiring because if you do

364
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,600
experience a problem in your home and

365
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,759
you're in an illegal state are you able

366
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
to actually call whoever is in the phone

367
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,078
book or on the internet for electrical

368
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
services you may need somebody on your

369
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,159
team that can handle electrical be very

370
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,559
careful messing with electricity don't

371
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,319
do it yourself if you're not qualified

372
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,078
don't burn the house down because you

373
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
decided to do electrical upgrades on

374
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,759
your own and you have no idea what

375
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
you're doing that puts a very bad look

376
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,519
on the cannabis industry that's going to

377
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
get you in trouble that's just a step

378
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
back for the legalization and the

379
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
freedom of cannabis so don't be that

380
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,759
person uh make friends with an

381
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,839
electrician do you know an electrician

382
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,200
find somebody that maybe works at an

383
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,440
electric company or works for an

384
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
electrical uh company that does installs

385
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,639
or something and buddy up with them and

386
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,719
see if they'll come do work for you on

387
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,519
the side so you don't have to involve

388
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
too many uh receipts and books and

389
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,039
things like that just find a friend is

390
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
what i'm trying to say be careful is

391
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,399
what i'm telling you also same thing

392
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,078

helpful and beneficial to you some other

415
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
things i want to talk about is do you

416
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
have backup pumps if you're running

417
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
hydroponics or any sort of moving water

418
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,479
sort of system deep water culture

419
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,239
trays ebb and flow do you have a backup

420
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,959
pump do you have a backup air pump and a

421
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,600
backup water pump because those things

422
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,919
love to [ __ ] out at the worst time

423
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
usually like friday seven o'clock right

424
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,799
after the growth store closed and you

425
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,159
got plans for the weekend you're going

426
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,759
to hear

427
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,120
and that's going to be your pump not

428
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,919
pumping water the way that it should be

429
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
you're going to take it apart you're

430
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,559
going to try to clean it you can put it

431
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
back together throw it in there and

432
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,518
smoke's going to come out of it still

433
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,039
[ __ ] you got to go get a new monday

434
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,120
pump everything's closed just ruin your

435
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,679
weekend have a backup i know they're a

436
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
little bit expensive but everything is

437
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,958
expensive if you can have a backup pump

438
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,600
that is one of the things i definitely

439
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,439
recommend having a backup of i also like

440
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,360
to have a backup ph tester because

441
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
sometimes my ph tester i don't believe

442
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
it i'll calibrate it i'll check it i'll

443
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,399
throw it in there and if just maybe

444
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,600
something will make me concerned i'll

445
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
check it with the other one i like to

446
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,759
have two just because [ __ ] does go

447
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
haywire keep them both calibrated and

448
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,759
cleaned properly calibrate them

449
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,560
frequently pay a lot of attention also

450
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,399
maybe have backup testing standards

451
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,919
because if you test it in your seven

452
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,078
solution you test it in your four and

453
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,879
one of those is expired now you're way

454
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,799
off have a backup testing standard

455
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,078
solution as well now we're just getting

456
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,719
crazy here but these are things i do

457
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,559
like to have backups of um something i

458
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,639
don't need a backup of something i want

459
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,000
a couple of around in the grow

460
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
especially since i've learned the

461
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
commercial growing environment you need

462
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,078
them every so many feet apart it's

463
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
either 50 or 150 feet i like to have a

464
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,838
fire extinguisher do you guys have a

465
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
fire extinguisher in your grow space i

466
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
don't want you to need it but i'd rather

467
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
you have it and not need it than need it

468
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,360
and be like [ __ ] i don't have anything

469
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,799
and you're just throwing reservoir water

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,120
on a fire that would be terrible also

471
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,599
do you have an eye wash station or some

472
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,360
sort of eye washing plan a lot of people

473
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
do have their grow at home but a lot of

474
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,278
people don't have access to water right

475
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
away in a commercial environment we need

476
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,120
water very close we need a eye wash

477
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
station very close

478
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
for the department of health and the

479
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,039
osha standards i recommend that you

480
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
carry a bottle of clean water on you or

481
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,799
within reach in your grow if you get

482
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,399
something in your eyes tear off your

483
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,078
gloves you should be wearing gloves tear

484
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,919
off your gloves get that clean water

485
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,000
bottle start pouring that water in your

486
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,159
eyes get that contaminant or whatever it

487
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720

pull out the phone bust out the hey siri

489
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,839

493
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
[ __ ] had from getting ph down or

494
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,879
whatever it was in your eyes all right

495

where are we i feel like i'm getting

496
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,078
rambling i've got a lot of notes here

497
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,120
that i do want to keep up on

498
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,638
all right the next part i'm going to

499
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,159
talk about is a little bit weird but

500
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
it's something that i do feel like we

501
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,919
should be prepared for especially if you

502
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,720
are in a red state or a non-friendly

503
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,759
state how quickly can you make your

504
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,639
entire operation disappear let's just

505
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,480
say hypothetically you piss somebody off

506
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
it happens people are [ __ ] sensitive

507
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,600
nowadays let's just say somebody gets

508
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,759
mad at you and they know what you're

509
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
doing and they go to the wrong people

510
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,320
and now the people are coming within 12

511
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,360
to 36 hours they're gonna be not even

512
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,040
knocking on your front door they're

513
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
gonna be pulling the [ __ ] front door

514
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,439
off can you make your [ __ ] disappear

515
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,440
within 12 to 24 to 36 hours with no sign

516
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
that it was even there can you get rid

517
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,199
of it if you do so make sure you get rid

518
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,278
of

519
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,198
everything all the way down to the

520
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,919
mixing shot glasses all the way down to

521
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,599
the instructional books clean up very

522
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,679
well do not leave a trace that anything

523
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,798
has happened will happen could have

524
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,359
happened no trace leave no trace how

525
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,279
quickly can you do that if you were in a

526
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,279
place where growing is not approved

527
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,720
tolerated or accepted that may be

528
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,318
something that you want to think about

529
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,959
you may want to be able to get rid of

530
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,240
that quite quickly if things do go wrong

531
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
for you do you have a plan do you have a

532
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,720
strategy also very importantly

533
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,959
it helps to have a good friend to help

534
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
you stay level headed when things like

535
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,240
that do happen so you have a bro that

536
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,759
can back you up

537
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,319
all right there is one more person that

538
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,240
we do want to make sure to have on our

539
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,960
team if we are going to be growing

540
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
cannabis in any legal or illegal sort of

541
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
fashion which by the way i should make a

542
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
disclaimer rosta jeff and the grow from

543
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,880

551
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480

have got a good working relationship

558
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,519
with a lawyer lawyers are readily

559
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,599
available a lot of them are terrible

560
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,440
many of them are [ __ ] awesome and can

561
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,519
be your best friend

562
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,759
just like your doctor i recommend you

563
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,679
are totally open with your lawyer once

564
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,960
you've paid them money everything you

565
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,480
say has a client lawyer confidentiality

566
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,919
clause they can't snitch on you right on

567
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
you if you kill somebody they may be

568
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
required to to tell on you for that i

569
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,279
don't think so though but if you're

570
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,558
doing crime and you do something or if

571
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,639
you did something or if you've got

572
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,399
something weird that is in a gray area

573
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,000
they cannot get you in trouble it is

574
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
best you let them know what you're doing

575
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
so they can prepare you can't properly

576
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
prepare if they don't know what you're

577
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,200
doing so let them know exactly what

578
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,960
you're up to if you've got an idea if

579
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,640
you're going to do something weird if

580
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
you're just curious about something

581
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
contact them that's what they're there

582
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,279
for you pay them

583
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,879
try to pay them a monthly fee if you can

584
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,200
for a certain amount of contacts or have

585
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,200
a retainer just have a relationship with

586
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,279
a lawyer make friendship with them if

587
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,960
you can go to lunch with them if you can

588
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,879
buy them lunch occasionally call them

589
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
just check in just see how things are

590
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,320
going maybe they'll call in and check in

591
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,759
with you that way when [ __ ] goes wrong

592
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,678
if it's three in the morning if it's one

593
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,599
in the afternoon when you call them they

594
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
answer on the first ring that is what

595
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,480
you want from your lawyer a lawyer

596
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
that's going to answer on the first ring

597
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
and do the work to get the case

598
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,519
dismissed because we all know you were

599
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,759
not doing anything illegal or wrong or

600
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,440
problematic or whatever i'm getting off

601
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,119
track here but i do recommend that

602
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,880
you've got the lawyer so we need

603
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,159
somebody that can help us out on a

604
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
backup date we need somebody that can

605
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,038
help us out if we are injured or have an

606
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,038
emergency we need someone that can help

607
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,798
us make the grow disappear it's always

608
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,440
good to have an electrician and an hvac

609
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,359
guy most importantly i always recommend

610
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,279
that you've got yourself a lawyer and

611
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,959
then get a bunch of grow books and keep

612
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,960
reading those that's what i recommend

613
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
all right that part took me right as

614
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
long as i was hoping it would take i do

615
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
have one more part of this podcast that

616
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,319
i do want to cover recently i did a

617
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,720
podcast called why i started making

618
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,038
seeds i did a really long uh

619
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,798
storytelling with rasta jeff if you will

620
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,079
as i was editing and listening to that

621
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,000
so many more

622
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,000
thoughts and memories and nostalgic

623
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
feelings came through my mind

624
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
and i forgot one

625
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
um

626
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
minor major details something that i

627
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,038
felt like i should have included in that

628
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,400
i talk a lot about uh making seeds and

629
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,440
getting seeds out to people so that

630
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,120
people can grow quality plants one thing

631
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,679
that was happening is i was posting

632
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,759
pictures of things uh like golden goat

633
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,080
golden goat is a very good example i

634
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,879

635
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,960

637
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240

638
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400

everybody to have access to

651
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,038
good quality genetics good seeds at a

652
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,759
good fair price and many many people

653
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,960
wanted the golden go so i took it upon

654
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,480
myself to make golden goat feminized

655
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
seeds that was one of the things i

656
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,079
really wanted to do was put some of

657
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,839
these elite cuts into people's hands in

658
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,359
a feminized form

659
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,918
so the golden goat is a very good

660
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,558
example of me putting a feminized line

661
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,280
of a very uh elite clone only out to the

662
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,918
market for people all over the world to

663
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,399
be able to grow and enjoy so making fem

664
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,320
seeds and making s-ones of clone onlys

665
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,159
was something i really enjoyed doing

666
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,480
because that was giving uh making it

667
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,679
more fair for everybody i i like the

668
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,279
idea of everybody having um the same uh

669
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,440
the equal playing field why should some

670
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,678
people in colorado be able to produce

671
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,679
better medicine than people in wyoming

672
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,120
or new mexico or arizona or even

673
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,280
california why should the people in

674
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,119
california be able to produce better

675
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,279
medicine than the people in colorado or

676
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,199
new york or the same states we should

677
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,599
all have access to the same thing if

678
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,519
you're sick you need medicine that was

679
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,279
my theory that is still my theory if

680
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,119
you're sick why would i not get you the

681
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,480
golden goat that would make you feel

682
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,399
better just because you're not in the

683
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,759
correct state that's [ __ ] stupid

684
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,519
that's silly that's what the government

685
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,679
has been doing they've been limiting you

686
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,519
us on medicine because you're not in the

687
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,080
appropriate square that allows you to

688
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,158
consume cannabis this square no weed no

689
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,079
relief no feeling good this square you

690
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,360
could feel good you could smoke weed so

691
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,759
i don't want to do that i think that

692
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,839
every state uh everywhere every country

693
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,000
every sick person every well person

694
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,000
should feel good and or better was my

695
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,839
theory behind that so i wanted to add

696
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,319
that short rant that minor detail that

697
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,158
point of passion if you will to this

698
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,558
part of the podcast make that another

699
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,400
part b of why i started breeding seeds

700
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,798
because i wanted it to be fair i don't

701
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,720
want i don't want to have just me with

702
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,158
elite genetics that's not fair

703
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
i love having elite genetics it's

704
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,360
[ __ ] cool that way everybody around

705
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,199
here gets to grow and breed with elite

706
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,798
[ __ ] genetics everybody's well

707
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,038
medicated super high and having a good

708
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,038
time but then my part of my passion is

709
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,359
making people feel better not a limited

710
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,480
amount of people everybody let's be fair

711
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,240
let's get that [ __ ] out there so that

712
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
was a big part of why i wanted to make

713
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
femmes especially s-ones uh that's a big

714
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
part of why i'm getting the seeds out

715
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,520
there so that everybody can grow the

716
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,679
good [ __ ] and feel better that's the

717
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,918
bottom line everybody grow the best herb

718
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,120
we can so the sick people can feel well

719
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,200
and the well people can feel even better

720
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,879
all right i think that is a good way and

721
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
a good time to start wrapping up this
