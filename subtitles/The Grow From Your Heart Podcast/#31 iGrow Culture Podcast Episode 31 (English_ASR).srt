00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,769

hemp oil will now be available for

113
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:28,139
shipping to all 50 states something I

114
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,668
find weird here and have to do more

115
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,500
research it says Charlotte's Web hemp

116
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,348
oil it's got the little trademark symbol

117
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,110
right above that so they've trademark

118
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:38,639
Charlotte's Web hemp oil the email from

119
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,379
realm of caring which will now be

120
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,970
referred to as roc explains that

121
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,529
Charlotte's Web product they will be

122
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,900
shipping falls within the federally

123
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,299
acceptable limit of less than 0 point

124
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,909
three percent of THC for classification

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,790
as a hemp derived food product

126
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,740
the email also states that the legality

127
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,840
of this product is still ambiguous and

128
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,060
recommends the patient sign up for their

129
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,179
state's medical marijuana programs to

130
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,589
provide your family more protection

131
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,939
however the organization will ship to

132
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:07,709
patients who have signed up for the

133
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,350
waitlist regardless of their home states

134
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:12,599
cannabis policies and regardless of each

135
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:17,340
individual client status is a licensed

136
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,230
medical cannabis patient so they found a

137
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,169
loophole apparently there is less than

138
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,030
point three percent THC in the

139
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,520
Charlotte's Web cannabis oil that

140
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,809
they're making let me call it the right

141
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,969
things they've trademarked it we've got

142
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,540
to sit right I got a scroll back up or

143
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,680
the hell did it don't Oh Charlotte's Web

144
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,260
hemp oil it's right there on the very

145
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,019
first sentence i scroll down way too far

146
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,250
so they're going to ship it to all 50

147
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,289
states that means people in

148
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,670
Massachusetts then you know pick a state

149
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,710
that you're afraid of if you live in a

150
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,710
state right now and cannabis is not

151
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:52,169
legal there you can get this product

152
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,519
ships to you if you were on their

153
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,660
waiting list I don't know how long ago

154
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,549
you had to sign up to get on the waiting

155
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,250
list but if you were there you can get

156
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,439
this product now I find that remarkable

157
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,269
I find that quite ballsy balls use the

158
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,800
word i'm going to use i find it really

159
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:06,449
compassionate and i really hope this

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,590
works out I hope this helps a lot of

161
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,449

162

182
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,829
really something i was glad to see

183
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,990
because we see all kinds of bad news all

184
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,180
the time right it's good to see some

185
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,000
great [Â __Â ] i'm going through as quick as

186
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,709
i can on twitter so it's nikon nico n

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,220
but he has at nemo pucks

188
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,810
chain at any mo p UNK 15 so give him a

189
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,220
shout out for me tome that you

190
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,680
appreciate hearing his story that he

191
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,260
sent me on the news here all right i'm

192
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,490
gonna scroll back down the cost of the

193
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,240
oil will be two hundred and fifty

194
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,480
dollars per bottle which is equal to

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,370
five cents per milligram of CBB so there

196
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,620
are pros and cons of the new development

197
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,829
and an explanation of why it's likely to

198
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,929
be quite different than the rsh Oh CBD

199
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,699
debacle we're going to have to there's

200
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:40,289
that's got a link to it so we're going

201
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,780
to check out the RSO r sh 0 CBD debacle

202
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,179
we're going to read that link also open

203
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:49,829
link in new tab and open link in new tab

204
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:51,299
owners that's the same thing we're going

205
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,490
to read those also sorry guys I'm rambly

206
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,719
because I took a couple of dads and I

207
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,889
just wanted to get this news out Mike

208
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,889
sent me this and I just wanted to get on

209
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:01,919
the mic and read it so according to roc

210
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:03,899
the oil will test at a consistent 30 to

211
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,699
1 ratio and the THC will be lower than

212
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,769
the point three percent allowed for food

213
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,610
products under federal law while

214
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,409
naysayers may question why this may why

215
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,629
this is any more legal than RSA chose

216
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:17,789
products it is critical to remember that

217
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,379
our sh 0 has been tested numerous times

218
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,169
by independent laboratories finding

219
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:25,169
contents in excess of one percent THC

220
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,899
which is undeniable lee illegal under

221
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:29,729
federal law and in non-medical states we

222
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,990
can only hope that our OCS testing and

223
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,659
quality control will be far more

224
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,850
reliable than RSA chose based on our OCS

225
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,189
established track record with products

226
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,560
already available in Colorado and

227
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,390
California this is likely to be the case

228
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,969
although maintaining a consistent ratio

229
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,980
of 30 to 1 will undoubtedly be

230
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,440
challenging for the company's growers

231
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,330
and extraction staff so guys haven't

232
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,040
seen a lot of initials here this R sh 0

233
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:58,020
let's go see what that is ah RS dicho

234
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,439
not a normal reaction to cannabis so

235
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:05,879
this is a product that shows a bottle it

236
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,530
looks like nature supplement there's

237
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,840
some in a syringe like an oral syringe

238
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,169
and then there's some in a bottle it's

239
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,550
eighteen percent CBD

240
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:16,378
and I want to read just this little

241
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:17,669
quick article that comes from I'll give

242
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,339
you some credit who wrote it it looks

243
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,360
like another Vanessa Walt article in the

244
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,639
wake of reports of serious

245
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,339
gastrointestinal effects from the real

246
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:31,409
scientific and boil a real scientific

247
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,939
hemp oil so it's a controversial product

248
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,188
people are claiming nausea vomiting

249
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:36,480
diarrhea people are saying that's a

250
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:38,278
normal effect so I don't know anything

251
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,899
about that I can't argue that from

252
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:44,370
taking this product from saying if

253
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,659
that's a good effect or not um okay it's

254
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,009
just another competing product we're

255
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,328
just going to go back to the article I

256
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,620
just wanted to make sure we knew what

257
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:53,549
that was also I said the CBD debacle I

258
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,980
click that link let's see what that's

259
00:10:53,549 --> 00:11:01,258
about it's another go figure it's

260
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,240
another Vanessa Walt's article that's

261
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,740
just another article about marketing CBD

262
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,730
so we're going to see a lot of that

263
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,799
stuff because it's going to get really

264
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,379
really popular or it is giving really

265
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,969
really popular apparently I'll continue

266
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:16,889
with the article as far as the feds

267
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,569
coming down with Roc Oh as far as the

268
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,068
feds coming down on roc with a question

269
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:22,019
mark that's actually a question so we're

270
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:24,958
supposed to say it like as far as the

271
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,698
feds coming down on roc that would be an

272
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,318
extremely poor PR move on the federal

273
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,599
government's part with all the hype

274
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:32,610
generated by Sanjay Gupta CNN specials

275
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,230
and the widespread media coverage on CBB

276
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,209
a federal crackdown on Charlotte's Web

277
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,129
would cause a huge uproar and the Fed

278
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,239
surely know this arresting and

279
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,850
prosecuting the self-proclaimed

280
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,409
Christian CBD providers from roc would

281
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,178
spurn an entirely different public

282
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,759
response than the arrest and prosecution

283
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:50,278
of RSA chose leaders many of whom have

284
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,528
already faced charges from the SEC and

285
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,308
other federal agencies my guess is that

286
00:11:52,528 --> 00:12:00,328
ROC is essentially untouchable and

287
00:11:55,308 --> 00:12:01,828
unimpeachable in this venture it's for

288
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:04,620
the negative side the most basic and

289
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:06,299
critical flaw is at 32 1 oil is unlikely

290
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,370
to help most epileptic children

291
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,198
anecdotal reports from Colorado families

292
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,240
using the higher ratio of Charlotte's

293
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,370
Web which is reportedly tested as high

294
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,249
as forty eight to one CBD to THC

295
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,480
indicate that their children are either

296
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:20,459
switching to other products to maintain

297
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,438
seizure control or supplementing

298
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,319
Charlotte's Web with higher THC products

299
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:27,019
available through Colorado's medical can

300
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,490
program this th d supplementation in

301
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,620
addition to mail order Charlotte's Web

302
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,000
is a viable option for children and

303
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,190
other medical States who have previously

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,220
been unable to find consistent sources

305
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,660
of clean well tested CBD products and in

306
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,910
non-medical states it is certainly

307
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:43,219
easier to find THC for supplementation

308
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:47,600
in the underground black market than it

309
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,800
is to find CBD oils or clones so yeah I

310
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,220
was thinking about that the whole time I

311
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,750
was reading this it's just cvd what

312
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,399
about that entourage effect we've talked

313
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,799
about so many times we got to get that

314
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:03,199
whole myriad of CBD THC th cv what about

315
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,179
the terpenoids that we're missing i

316
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,500
think all of it does it together and

317
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:08,269
they're saying that they're actually

318
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,190
trying they're needing to supplement

319
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,860
with some higher THC products because

320
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,800
the CBD is not working completely it's

321
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,539
probably helping its you know just like

322
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,919
any medication that you would take or

323
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,929
anything new you would introduce your

324
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,729
bought to your body the first few times

325
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,589
you consume or take that you're going to

326
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,019
notice a stronger reaction and after

327
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,240
anything a few times a few time you're

328
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:32,689
going to quit feeling as strong of an

329
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,120
effect so i'm pretty sure that this CBB

330
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,290
does work you know for a while maybe for

331
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,120
a long time for some people maybe

332
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,769
forever for some but some people that's

333
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,269
gonna you're going to need that THC I

334
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,279
think I've repeated and rambled about

335
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,069
that long enough so let me wrap up the

336
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,419
last paragraph here in short there

337
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,520
should be a positive step in the war on

338
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:51,799
cannabis at the very least it should

339
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,379
force federal opinion on the legality of

340
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,879
CBB hemp products it will likely benefit

341
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:58,070
some number of patients especially those

342
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,649
who are able to supplement with THC and

343
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,800
unlike the CBD only legislation that has

344
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,329
been pushed by roc the shipping of

345
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,759
Charlotte's Web is unlikely to have a

346
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,590
negative impact on future whole planet

347
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,299
legislation while the concept of

348
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,250
trademarking a plant and hoarding a

349
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,500
strain still rubs many patients and

350
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,360
industry insiders the wrong way the

351
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,309
bottom line is that more patients will

352
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,470
soon be able to access CBD rich oil

353
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,209
without having to move to realm of

354
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,790
carrying states and that's a good thing

355
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,530
ah this lady seems to know what she's

356

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,079
shoulders when it comes to marijuana

366
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,309
cannabis that's one thing we got to do

367
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,539
we gotta quit sayin marijuana and say

368
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,768

369
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:57,958
reading the word marijuana and now it's

370
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:59,879

that out there grow clones of that if

375
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,068
you live in a legal state cut a lot of

376
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:12,889
clones whenever you cut clones get to

377
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:15,778
your plant account cut that many clones

378
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,818
give those out if you have extras in

379
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,778
order Stan sorry I'm thinking too many

380
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,659
thoughts and once right now trying to do

381
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,850
a show and ramble so if you've got

382
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,409
clones of CBD medicine put those out

383
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,819
there so I'm saying because we don't

384
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,759
want these companies taking over all

385
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:32,519
that [Â __Â ] why do we want a company and

386
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,810
charger that that doesn't seem that's

387
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,490
why we're that's why most of us are

388
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,138
smoking medical cannabis anyways because

389
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,940
we don't want a company getting rich off

390
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,698
of us or a company telling us what we

391
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,899
can and cannot consume so I'm going to

392
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,120
move on to the next article because I

393
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,708
feel like I'm ranting super dabbed out I

394
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,299
got a quick in so high on these episodes

395
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:51,049
it's kind of fun to tell you the truth

396
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,068
so I showing oh yeah hi if I want to

397
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,500
this article remember a little while

398
00:15:53,068 --> 00:16:00,059
back we talked about a police officer

399
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:03,690
who gave out a whole bunch of tickets 66

400
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,278
citations in seattle who's the main guy

401
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,100
giving out all the pot tickets we give

402
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,049
them the big middle finger here's

403
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,720
another article that came from seattle

404
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:15,179
credit goes to the associated press it

405
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,769
says Seattle's police chief has asked

406
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,509
the city to seek dismissal of all

407
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,028
marijuana citations issued by the

408
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,620
bicycle officer who eighty percent of

409
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,600
the tickets handed out during the first

410
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,528
half of this year for using pot in

411
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,569
public Seattle Times reports that chief

412
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:32,159
Kathleen O'Toole said Friday the request

413
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:34,259
to the City Attorney's Office stems from

414
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,059
the conclusion that the 66 citations

415
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,339
were written as part of the officers

416
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,869
personal agenda which will says the

417
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,339
tickets were written for the wrong

418
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,799
reason bicycle officer wrote 66 of the

419
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:48,600
83 such tickets issued in the first half

420
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,278
of the year of the city the student

421
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,028
wrote

422
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,698
66 of 83 tickets in the first half of

423
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:57,799
year so in six months every month is d

424
00:16:55,698 --> 00:17:01,818
busted wrote 11 tickets for people

425
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:03,649
smoking pot the officer wrote on one

426
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,658
citation that he used a coin toss to

427
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:09,409
decide which of two men got the ticket

428
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:11,630
and on another described state voter

429
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:16,280
approval of marijuana legalization as

430
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:18,439
silly what he freakin he wrote on the

431
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,379
citation that he used a coin to decide

432
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,329
which two guys got the ticket how can

433
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,370
cops get away with that he wrote it on

434
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:27,438
the ticket I guess he's not he's they're

435
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,298
trying to make him not count now they're

436
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,130
trying to say how your tickets don't kow

437
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,538
would that be a big middle finger if the

438
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,610
authorities gave the authority a big

439
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:36,440
metal finger like that I like it the

440
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:38,359
time since the officer has apologized to

441
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,808
o'toole she is reportedly still

442
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,069
considering disciplinary action the city

443
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:45,109
attorney Pete Holmes spokeswoman

444
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:47,779
Kimberly mill says homes will review the

445
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,548
Chiefs request initiative 502 approved

446
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,288
by Washington voters included a simple

447
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:56,029
fine / for public consumption of

448
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:58,038
marijuana so uh we kind of got a some

449
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:00,740
people on our side because they let that

450
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,940
cop they may let that cops tickets slide

451
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,409
that'll be kind of neat i'm scrolling

452
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,788
through the neck to the next article um

453
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:10,460
they were talking about in denver about

454
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:13,069
banning BHO extraction and banning

455
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,159
certain types of extractions without

456
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:17,960
being in a licensed facility or what

457
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,390

458
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,350
to be a little more accurate sorry I'm

459

466
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,928
home hash oil so it says alcohol based

467
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,149
extraction process will join water and

468
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,830
food based method methods as acceptable

469
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:47,659

production so that they could be amended

476
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,079
to accommodate residents who use an

477
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,700
alcohol-based process sorry should have

478
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,519
fallen over on the table here not even

479
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,870
sure what's happened and that was weird

480
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,849
several people argued for the change to

481
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,349
the safety and well-being committee

482

486
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,150
ordinance or could vote October

487
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,089
sixteenth on whether to send it to the

488
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,640
full council the proposal would ban the

489
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:31,519
amateur use of butane or other gases and

490
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,470

resulted in doesn't dozens of home

492
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,059
explosions statewide this year license

493
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,039
businesses still could use that process

494
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,919
the people who make hash oil at home

495
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:48,019
would have to use save water and food

496
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:53,120
based methods um this is going to have

497
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,440
two different effects um well people are

498
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,149
going to people do [Â __Â ] that's illegal

499
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,350
anyway so I don't think the people are

500
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,880
going to stop doing it it's just going

501
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,399
to make it a little sketchier and now

502
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,350
that's going to cause more uh more

503
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,090
people sneak it around doing it you have

504
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:06,169
to do it in a little more sketchy place

505
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,970
which means you're a little more

506
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,850
enclosed which is the dangerous part of

507
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,630
it and also I think it's going to make

508
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:16,250
the street value of pho dad to go up and

509
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,480
already right now dads are getting kind

510
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,549
of hard to find around here and the

511
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,460
prices are going up really high and it's

512
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:25,190
because they're making rules like this I

513
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,259
agree i don't want some uneducated dude

514
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,640
next door and his garage making hatch

515
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,109
while i'm sitting here trying to record

516
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,030
a podcast i don't need the next door

517
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:35,329
house blowing up and screwing up all of

518
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:38,149
our lives so i guess it's kind of you

519
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:40,939
know the adult and made the parent in me

520
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:44,600
the freaking smart guy says we should

521
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,600
not be blasting like that so that's kind

522
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:49,250
of cool do but then and we got to get

523
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,889
the shops or we got to figure out a way

524
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,170
that we can get some kind of private

525
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,710
caregivers to be able to blast it if we

526
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,930
build our own rooms if I have OSHA come

527
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,079
and build me a blast safe room can I

528
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,120
make it in there then

529
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,619
maybe please you know there has to be

530
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,589
some kind of exception because the shops

531
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:10,289
are charging way too much right now for

532
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:11,699
shatter and a lot of it is [Â __Â ] to tell

533
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,019
you the truth I wouldn't dab a lot of

534
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,299
the hash that I've seen come from the

535
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,519
shops I am a little bit of a hash nub to

536
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,339
tell you the truth but uh I don't want

537
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,019
to dab a lot of that [Â __Â ] so let me show

538
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,179
you I've got a camera going here guys

539
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,129
I'll post some pictures of this I'm kind

540
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,470
of working on putting up YouTube videos

541
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,140
it's got hot I can't sue let me switch

542
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,339
to the video this got hot in the car but

543
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,960
this is golden goat shadow right here it

544
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:41,339
should be nice and stable it shouldn't

545
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,809
be goopy soupy and poopy and then I'm

546
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,789
going to contradict myself by showing

547
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,200
you some live resin that is a little bit

548
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,970
gooey but this is a different product

549
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,539
this isn't shatter we're not marketing

550
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:55,589
this air shatter this is live resin it's

551
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,869
a golden and clear that is bra that's

552
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,909
just we've talked about libraries and

553
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:01,769
it's fresh frozen butane blasted Bloods

554
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,000
never to close the loop shoutout to the

555
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:04,470
guy that did it for me he knows what's

556
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,400
up he knows who he is i don't know if i

557
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,829
should say his name on the show right

558
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,230
now good work that shits gold and really

559
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,909
golden looking but the shops are

560
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,309
searching too much for duty and that

561
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,690
sucks so they have to let the artists

562
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,909
the extract artists that know what

563
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,769
they're doing the people that they kind

564
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,630
of led this movement as it think

565
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:22,680
everything happened not everything

566
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,510
that'll make sorry I'm adjusting a

567
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,060
camera over heroin rambling the guys

568
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,170
that I have evolved all this hash stuff

569
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,089
they've done the research they've done

570
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,190
the work we need to be able to do it in

571
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:35,789
a safe manner and I know that open

572
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,830
blasting is not a safe manner I wonder

573
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,940
if this is let's see this is going to

574
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,579
have anything to do with the guys with

575
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,330
the closed loop system let's go through

576
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:46,710
this article one quick time and see

577
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:48,449
would ban amateur use of propane or

578
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,640
other gases and extraction of oil from

579
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,200
yeah the [Â __Â ] says closed loop system

580
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,600
or not I think in the way that that's

581
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,950
word it so we're gonna have to be

582
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,909
careful I know a few guys that have

583
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,230
invested in a closed loop system

584
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,820
thinking that that was solved the

585
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,680
problem and now look they're changing

586
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,789
the rules right around you all right I'm

587
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,710
gonna get back into the article it says

588
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,329
Brian Wilson whose family moved from New

589
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,009
Jersey to Denver earlier this year so

590
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,839
his three-year-old daughter Vivian could

591
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:11,129
use medical marijuana treatments say

592
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,089
neither of those methods will produce

593
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,130
the kind of oil suitable for her

594
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:18,069
he uses an ethanol based extraction

595
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,860
process I didn't move out here to put

596
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:24,069
her at more risk Wilson said Denver fire

597
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:25,990
chief elected Eric tape excuse me I told

598
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,599
the committee that the proposal likely

599
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,819
could be amended to allow alcohol based

600
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:34,240
methods with limits on use of heat and

601
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:36,970
amount of alcohol to keep it safe see I

602
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,230
guess if I man I don't like rules and

603
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,850
stuff but I don't like fires and

604
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,849
explosions either if I have a choice a

605
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:45,039
couple of rules or a couple of fires and

606
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:47,230
the Rastafarian me says [Â __Â ] the rules I

607
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,920
love a dollar but the other part of me

608
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,059
says I don't like fire um let me explain

609
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,289
why I keep saying that I need a dollar

610
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:57,669
if you're not a common listener what's a

611
00:23:55,289 --> 00:24:02,170
regular listener what's the phrase for

612
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,900
that a regular listener i guess um every

613
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,250
time i say the f-word I owe a dollar and

614
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,290
there's a charity there's a guy is not a

615
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,819
charity it's a sick person sick child

616
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,990
that will get my dollars every time I

617
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,819
say the f-word you guys have to tweet me

618
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,519
tell me when I said it tell me how many

619
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,379
have times in this episode I said it it

620
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,819
starts on episode 30 this is 31 so you

621
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,880
got to episode 3 can make some money off

622
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:23,139
me after a couple episodes if I don't

623
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,790
stop saying the F word i'm going to

624
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,860
increase the dollar amount i'll go from

625
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,629
a dollar then I'll be like all right now

626
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:30,250
I'm just not now i'm not saying this but

627
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,690
hypothetically in the future i'll start

628
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,630
charging myself five dollars for every

629
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,130
time i say that F word I mean if I still

630
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,720
don't stop will charge ten bucks and

631
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,490
then it's gonna start costing me money

632
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,930
and money counts and I don't want to say

633
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,370
that word on the show and I don't want

634
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,289
to pay money so it's gonna work together

635
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:46,659

Broadway LLC at the fair oh man so we

664
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,700
talked about this a little while back

665
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,500
there was a pot pavilion at the Denver

666
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,110
County Fair they had a joint rolling

667
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,910
contest where actually they rolled

668
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:19,289
oregano instead of rolling pot but at a

669
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,120
joint rolling contest they had a lot of

670
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:22,740
stuff going on actually had a pot

671
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,939
growing competition off site where

672
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,259
people had to grow their pot and then

673
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,150
people go look at it somewhere else

674
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:28,379
because they didn't want it there you

675
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,350
were not supposed to bring any pot

676
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:35,000
products to this fair that's not what

677
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:37,649
was supposed to happen but a full melt

678
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,190
handed out some chocolate bars that

679
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,720
people ate them and seven people are now

680
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:48,059
named as plaintiffs in a class action

681
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,250
lawsuit against these guys ah imagine

682
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,039
and we had this talk a little while back

683
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,509
on the show but imagine if you were not

684
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,029
a pot smoker somebody listening to the

685
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:58,829
show may not be pot smokers some of you

686
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:00,539
may be amateur pot smoker some of you I

687
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:02,429
know only have smoked a little while

688
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,599
some of you can only smoke very

689
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,269
occasionally

690
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:09,139
and if you eat a hundred milligram

691
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:12,319
edible you're going to get really high

692
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,940
so imagine if you went to the fair and

693
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,409
you're just hanging out and come looking

694
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,110
with drug this chocolate man and you're

695
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,788
like they have weed in it like no you're

696
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:22,678
like I believe you you work for this

697
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:24,269
company and you've got the apron on that

698
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,038
says the company neither behind the

699
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,980
booth I believe you so you eat the

700
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,329
chocolate right probably 45 minutes

701
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,610
later you're gonna [Â __Â ] in your pants

702
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:34,048
because you're too high oh man imagine

703
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,089
that you got to try to drive home and

704
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:38,099
the weird part of the head trip of it

705
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,990
man my opinion is you don't realize that

706
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:42,048
you ate something that was gonna make

707
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,370
you feel intoxicated so now you're like

708
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:45,629
tripping a little bit because you're

709
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,399
high right you're starting to feel

710
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,840
whatever whatever you whatever comes on

711
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,970
first you get the team believes in your

712
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,500
arms and then things are a little funny

713
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,230

714
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,579
know why and and but now you really

715
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,960

what if you were a reporter that was on

733
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,298
the clock see this could have caused a

734
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,288
lot of problems um we shouldn't talk too

735
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,369
much about it because I guess there's a

736
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:39,750
court case and somebody could hear what

737
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,178
I'm saying again that is [Â __Â ] up I

738
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,710
didn't realize that I'll another goddamn

739
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,650
dollar this is going to be an expensive

740
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,079
episode ah so seven people are going to

741
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,450
make a lot of money off of full melt

742
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,509
chocolate and live well guys so be

743
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,860
careful if you ever go to a fair or an

744
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:57,298
event they're handing out cannabis

745
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,798
chocolates in your a lightweight or

746
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:01,529
you're not aware of what you're getting

747
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,759
as carefully and then I guess if you get

748
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,759
the wrong [Â __Â ] sue the hell out of them

749
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:07,589
I probably what it did I wouldn't if you

750
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,390
did to me but if you gave my daughter a

751
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,889
medicated chocolate and told her that it

752
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,600
was a regular chocolate that's I'm

753
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,040
definitely you're gonna yeah there's

754
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,059
gonna be at least a court case it might

755
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,409
be against me

756
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,849
for me reacting to that [Â __Â ] but

757
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,970

around it off of an old school rig that

782

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,920
little one on the show

788
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:36,250

790
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:55,409
dab all right so I've mentioned a couple

791
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:58,770
of times that i'm doing a video on this

792
00:30:55,409 --> 00:31:01,020
episode i'm trying to go through all of

793
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:03,359
the old episodes and just make really

794
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,918
cheesy I movie videos so that they can

795
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,808
be up on youtube so that people that

796
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,820
don't have an iphone or don't have

797
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:11,399
stitcher or whatever who are more simple

798
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:12,569
and more familiar with the YouTube well

799
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,460
it'll just give us another way to be

800
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,720
listened so I'm going to throw the show

801
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,940
up on YouTube they'll be really simple

802
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,788
videos at first I'll learn how to make

803
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,798
better videos as time goes by the first

804
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:24,839
few will be cheesy I promise you the

805
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:28,349

be some kalonji there may be a little

843
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,820
bit of night nurse um a lot of what I

844
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,230
make goes to the people around here

845
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,480
before it makes it too dangerous green

846
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,990
remedies it goes to other places before

847
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,308
it gets there I I take care of the local

848
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,200
first take care of the people around me

849
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:03,269
my patients on my caregiver those guys

850
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,529
get the seeds first that I make and I

851
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:06,509
put what i have on nature's green

852
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,889
remedies when they order from me so I

853
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:10,410
let them know when I have stuff they'll

854
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,610
order it and then they'll put it on the

855
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:17,640
website guys it's gonna be honestly

856
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:22,529
coughing and counting so we're looking

857
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,540
about probably 75 to 90 days ish I don't

858
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:26,009
want to make any huge promises and there

859
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,170
should be some stuff on nature's green

860
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,789
remedies maybe a hundred days I'm gonna

861
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,759
say because you know any packaging time

862
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:34,109
and all that stuff trying time right

863
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,119
around 100 days there should be some

864
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:39,149
stuff available from IRA genetics again

865
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,399
in a tree and remedies calm apologize

866
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,179
for not being able to keep them in stock

867
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,160
honestly it's kind of a good sign that

868
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:48,360
they're sold out that means i'd be doing

869
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,240

974
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:22,980
move up in the ranks we can legalize pot

975
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,689

00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,919
time spread that [Â __Â ] around the world

979
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,440

980
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,630

981
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,150

episodes on youtube that's a huge

986
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:46,980
commitment you guys it takes a lot of

987
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:49,349
chunk of time I'm going to try to do it

988
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,230
and uploading an episode to youtube it

989
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:54,180
takes the computer all day to get it up

990
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,289
there so sometimes it fails after you do

991
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:57,299
it and that's the fun part of life

992
