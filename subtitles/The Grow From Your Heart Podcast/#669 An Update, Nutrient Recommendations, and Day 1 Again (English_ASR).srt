114
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,119
in front of me

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
that i do want to address this is uh

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
comes from a previous episode in a

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
previous episode i read a question about

118
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,039
a commercial grow whose plants were

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,319
getting too tall they weren't finishing

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,240
on time uh people wanted to send me a

121
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,719
lot of suggestions a lot of ideas on

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
what to do with this grow we did receive

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
a lot of great input a lot of great

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
ideas however

125
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,399
there were a lot of small adjustments

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
and small details that weren't going to

127
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,478
make a big enough impact overall in this

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
commercial growth to make it worth the

129
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,719
time

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
uh energy

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
money and effort to make those changes

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
in this grow this is a commercial

133
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,639
environment think about uh if we're

134
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
gonna make a small adjustment in your

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,800
growth think about the time energy and

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,079
cost it takes to make it in your grow

137
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,600
and then think if we're going to do that

138
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,839
in a commercial environment it costs

139
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,360
100 times the cost to do that because

140
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,359
we're doing it if you're doing it to one

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
light we're doing it to a hundred we've

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
got to repeat the process a hundred

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
times we have to buy the equipment a

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,360
hundred times we have to take the

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
manpower or woman power to install or

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,038
adjust or adapt that new equipment we

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
have to test the equipment we have to

148
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,800
learn the equipment it takes a lot of

149
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,879
time to have people come in there a lot

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
of money a lot of energy and then in the

151
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,959
long run if you've got your personal

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,319
grow with two four one however many

153
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,519
small lights you've got going i'm not

154
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,680
downplaying your grumps and your

155
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,439
personal grow is a small grow that's

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,038
your girl in a commercial environment

157
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,478
we're doing things on an exponential

158
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,639
scale compared to what you've got going

159
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,038
at home in most cases and in a

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
commercial environment we're getting

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,639
very little return on our investment

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,400
after staffing after payroll after the

163
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,519
rent on the building the electricity on

164
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,239
the building licensing taxes packaging

165
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,639
transportation fees uh workmen's comp

166
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,960
lawyers the lawyer the accountant all of

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,680
that stuff eats into all of our profit

168
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,359
and hopefully it's just you uh your

169
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,879
trimming partner and hopefully the

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
lawyer is all that you've got to pay

171
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,279
hopefully you got that lawyer on

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
retainer take care of that if you're

173
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,399
growing everybody growing should have a

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
lawyer no matter what you're doing i

175
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,799
should have a lawyer anyway but my point

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
is that at a home grow

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
your return on investment is much

178
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,000
greater and our return on investment in

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,079
a commercial growth is much smaller

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,240
because we have much more expenses many

181
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,478
more expenses so making small

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
adjustments like that are much uh more

183
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,519
costly than it would be in a small

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
environment we've got to repeat it a

185
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,839
hundred times if we have a hundred

186
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,120
lights there were some great

187
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,038
recommendations uh things like changing

188
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
the light spectrum and

189
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,879
changing the temperature in the night

190
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
things like that that would help but not

191
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,360
uh to the uh the degree which we need

192
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,598
help in this commercial environment

193
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,800
those plants were obviously being

194
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,399
flowered

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
being veg for two or three weeks too

196
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,918
long they were getting too big they just

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,280
needed to be done sooner uh we couldn't

198
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,198
it was a commercial environment people

199
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,719
said raise the fans raise the lights

200
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
it's a commercial grow bro we probably

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
got three foot tall tables 12 foot

202
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,560
lights 18-foot ceilings we've maxed out

203
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,759
with what we can do we can't just raise

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,519
the lights

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000
we can't go around and put blue lights

206
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,279
up everywhere uh the commer then then

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,478
where's the profit if you got a

208
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,478
commercial girl then where did the

209
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
profit go there are 100 lights you gotta

210
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,000
replace half of them with blue bulbs

211
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,318
that's 50 bulbs you got to buy they're

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
100 each you do the math on there that's

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
500 i know that's not a real number i'm

214
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
hoping you're paying attention all right

215
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
so there were a lot of great ideas but

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
most of them are not feasible the main

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
solution to that is better scheduling

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
the plants were too big we know they're

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,598
too big they're repeatedly too big

220
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,318
they're growing into the lights they're

221
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,800
going into the fans the easy logical

222
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
solution is flower earlier have smaller

223
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
plants don't grow them so damn big

224
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
they're more manageable they're healthy

225
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,799
less time on the road is less time for a

226
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,759
crash also if those plants are only in

227
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,079
the room for a total of like four weeks

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,439
of veg and [ __ ] nine weeks of flower

229
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,279
that's two or three weeks less

230
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,360
opportunity for powdery mildew spider

231
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,918
mites thrips fungus gnats over watering

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
ph lockout power failures other weird

233
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,959
[ __ ] to go on because in a commercial

234
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,959
environment

235
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,638
all things that can go wrong will until

236
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,638
you get the facility dialed in and

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
everything is perfect things will go and

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
then things will continue to go wrong

239
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,478
because pumps will go out power will

240
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
fail like air conditioners will fail

241
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,519
weird shit's going to happen all the

242
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,199
time you've got to adjust and adapt i've

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,278
talked about that enough

244
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
so that's a good setup for this one

245
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,679
message that i did get i've been talking

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,599
quite a bit uh this one says rosta jeff

247
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,519
question on what you said on not being

248
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,759
able to shorten the flowering phase yes

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,200
on that episode i did say that we can't

250
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,799
shorten the flowering phase the plants

251
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
have to flower for their nine or ten

252
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,799
weeks until they're finished and that we

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
should shorten the veg phase because

254
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,838
then you make you just start with

255
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,278
smaller plants you don't grow them as

256
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
big and they don't finish as big it

257
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,600
makes sense to me but this one was a

258
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,879
great question it says isn't that what

259
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,120
new millennium winter frost claims to do

260
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,720
on the dude grow show i think jaren the

261
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,799
new millennium guy said you can get

262
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
different strains to finish at the same

263
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,159
time

264
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,319
um yes the new millennium product uh the

265
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,559
winter frost product from new millennium

266
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
will cause the plants to go into their

267
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,838
finishing stage a little more quickly

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
they will start ripening they will go

269
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
into senescence a little bit sooner when

270
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
you feed them that product they will be

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
triggered uh there's something in there

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,839
that tells them hey it's the end it's

273
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,278
time to go uh to the end phase

274
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,120
but would you rather have a room that's

275
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,360
proper or would you rather have to feed

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
a product that is going to trigger the

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,039
finishing like a you could put a

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
band-aid on it and spend all kinds of

279
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,559
money on this product or you could fix

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,480
the schedule and do it right and also

281
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,799
this product isn't going to cut two or

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,879
three weeks off this may cut five maybe

283
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,719
seven days maybe ten at the most but

284
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,720
it's not going to cut that many days off

285
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
your full cycle and the grow we were

286
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
talking about it sounded like they

287
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
needed two maybe three full weeks cut

288
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,958
off of their process so that's a great

289
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,440
idea to use the new millennium winter

290
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,679
frost but it's not going to be a drastic

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
enough change now speaking of drastic

292
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,759
changes here's another great thing we

293
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,159
can talk about diurnal temperature

294
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
swings if we narrow down that swing if

295
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,600
we don't have more than five degrees

296
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,360
between our day and night swing and

297
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
maybe five or ten percent humidity

298
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,200
between our day and night swing that

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,879
will help with the stretch that initial

300
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,879
stretch into the flowering phase that

301
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,958
may help that may be a way to do it

302
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,799
popping and twisting the stems

303
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,039
cracking the branches that may be one

304
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,159
way to do it but overall the ultimate

305
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,159
solution as a as the consultant who sees

306
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,519
the overall problem as an experienced

307
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,319
grower who's been in these commercial

308
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,919
facilities the answer to that was just

309
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
flower earlier why are you going to grow

310
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,159
10 foot tall plants if you've only got a

311
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
14 foot ceiling grow

312
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,360
5 foot tall plants flower them out

313
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,440
they'll be 10 feet tall you've got 4

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,759
feet of extra space think ahead plan

315
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,000
ahead we talked about that before be

316
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,838
successful all right let me hit my notes

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,839
here recap myself get myself back on

318
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
track make sure we're doing this right

319
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,160
um yes question about winterfrost we

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
covered that okay now i do have more

321
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,759
emails in front of me do i want to give

322
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,159
this person a shout out do they want

323
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,600
their name said this one if they did not

324
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,439
leave their name

325
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
um but big shout out you know who you

326
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,560
are thank you for sparking great content

327
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,958
i do want to keep moving i'm awful

328
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,239
rambly today so i do need to keep myself

329
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,679
on track

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
all right i'm not sure if this message

331
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,879
is trolling me or if this was 100

332
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,919
serious i'm going to read it anyway if

333
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,320
you're trolling me uh good job and if

334
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,559
you're not trolling me uh listen this

335
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,079
time it goes on it says hey ross to jeff

336
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,319
i'm growing a few of your strains and

337
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
i'm just curious when to start counting

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,120
flowering days do i start at light

339
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,440
switch of 1212 or when i start seeing

340
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,679
pre-flowers then it goes on here's the

341
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,839
best part i heard on an episode that you

342
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,359
said you start counting at the light

343
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
switch

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,519
that's what i said bro you i start

345
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,759
counting at the light switch is this

346
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
correct or should i add some weeks keep

347
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,399
up the good work and i will continue to

348
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,919
work with you and your company

349
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,559
um my friend saul you heard me right i'm

350
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,519
gonna say it again i always start

351
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,759
counting flowering days on an indoor

352
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,879
grow the day i flip the lights to 1212.

353
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,278
all right i'm going to look into this

354
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,399
camera say it at another angle

355
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,639
i always and i recommend you always

356
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,360
start counting flowering days in an

357
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,560
indoor grow from the day you flip the

358
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,039
lights to 12 12. if you do a unique

359
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,919
creative fancy flowering light cycle

360
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,480
like maybe 11 13 or something like that

361
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,879
start counting the day you change that

362
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,120
timer to 12 12 or 11 13 that is day one

363
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,600
of flower don't adjust that don't play

364
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
with that that is day one

365
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,159
why would we

366
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,719
put

367
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,600
63 days of flowering and then you start

368
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,399
flowering on this day but then subtract

369
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,120
14 days or add 14 days i didn't put a

370
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,440
math problem on the package it says nine

371
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,639
weeks of flowering so the day you start

372
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,560
flowering is day one at the end of nine

373
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,560
weeks not at the start of nine weeks

374
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,399
either people say i've gone eight full

375
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,000
weeks i'm gonna chop down tomorrow i say

376
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,519
you've got the ninth week to go and they

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,159
say week nine is tomorrow and i go hey

378
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,159
you still got to you've got to finish

379
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,559
that week you've got to finish the ninth

380
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:37,120
week if it says nine to ten weeks let it

381
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:39,278
go 10 completed weeks 70 days so you've

382
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,198
got to let it finish

383
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,919
so the plants are going to take 9 to 10

384
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
weeks from the day you flip that timer

385
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,399
to 12 12. when you go in there and you

386
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:53,599
change the timer from 9 pm on to 9 a.m

387
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,600
off you are not 12 hours off 12 hours on

388
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,320
in your 24 hour day

389
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,959
that is day one of flowering write it

390
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,199
down take a screenshot on your phone

391
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,559
make some sort of a note that says day

392
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,240
one of flowering is today this day maybe

393
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,239
get a piece of duct tape and write that

394
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
date on the piece of duct tape and stick

395
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
that duct tape on the door or possibly

396
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,719
on the pot of the plant that you were

397
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,159
flowering keep that note somewhere that

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
you will find it that you will not

399
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,879
forget i've got weird ocd i like to

400
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,519
flower on the first that way i know that

401
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,039
in two months the next first on that

402
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,198
third month will be when i'm harvesting

403
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,120
so if i start flowering january first we

404
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,000
got all of january we got all of

405
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,159
february march 1st i got a crop so that

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,320
means that a little bit before march 1st

407
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,439
i need to get my next crop coming up

408
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,959
just planning thinking like that so um

409
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
i've been going on for a long time about

410
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,879
this i don't know how many times i can

411
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,518
say it i don't know how else to stress

412
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,838
it um

413
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,399
flowering day one starts the day that

414
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,160
you flip the timer to 12 12. if you're

415
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,519
outdoors that's a different environment

416
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,838
that's a different thing we don't know

417
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
when we change the timer to 12 12 then

418
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
pay attention your trichomes pay

419
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
attention to the plants it's all about

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
watching the plants most of the time

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
anyway i was going to segue into that so

422
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,919
that's a great way to do it

423
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
the calendar is a great thing my

424
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,479
recommendation on the seed package is a

425
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,919
great thing but there will be variables

426
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,920
like always in life there will be

427
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,240
variables you've got to pay attention to

428
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,159
your trichomes the trichomes on your

429
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
plant are what indicate ripeness when

430
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,120
those trichomes are turning amber some

431
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
people like different ratios

432
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,000
i'm going to say somewhere between 20

433
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,800
and 30 amber trichomes on your plant

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,278
that is that is when it is a good time

435
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,198
to harvest the trichomes are the thing

436
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,439
that contain the active ingredient the

437
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,958
active compounds which give us a buzz

438
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,079
that make us stoned that contain thc cbd

439
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,078
cbn cbg all of the other wonderful

440
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,399
cannabinoids we're seeking those are all

441
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,319
in our trichome let's get the trichome

442
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
right that's what we're after we are

443
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
trichome farmers a lot of people think

444
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,519
they're growing big beautiful plants

445
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,519
that's what you're growing the main

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,078
thing you are working on is beautiful

447
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,720
trichomes we want those trichomes now

448
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,278
since i'm on this path this rant ah

449
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079
pistols or you guys call them hairs the

450
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,439
hairs do not have anything with

451
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,120
indication of ripeness those hairs those

452
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
pistols are the breeding parts of the

453
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
plant those things can change colors a

454
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
lot of people will say when the hairs

455
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,758
turn brown or when the pistols turn

456
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,838
brown that's when the plants are

457
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,919
finished that is false that is wrong

458
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
that is inaccurate those parts are for

459
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,399
breeding those parts of the plant can be

460
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,519
damaged destroyed withered

461
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,198
ruined from all kinds of things a spray

462
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,120
will make your pistols can make your

463
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,479
pistols of your plants turn brown and

464
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,039
wither up

465
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,519
wind can do it your skin oil touching it

466
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,679
can do it that plant just passing up its

467
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,679
point of peak pollination can do it

468
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,198
those plants only want pollen for so

469
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,958
long into their life they're just like

470
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,198
people they have a time when they can

471
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,879
reproduce and then that time expires and

472
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120
when that time expires on a plant the

473
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,559
pistols turn brown and dry up and wither

474
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
up and shrink in

475
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,958
some people will say at that point this

476
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,279
plant is ready for harvest

477
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,640
those people would be wrong those

478
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:14,000
pistols those hairs do not have any

479
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,079
indicator any indication anything to do

480
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,038
with the ripeness of your plant we are

481
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,639
trichome farmers we want ripe trichomes

482
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,078
unless you're breeding for seeds

483
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,759
trichomes are all you should be

484
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,558
measuring ripeness by if you're breeding

485
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,640
for seeds then of course measure by the

486
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,119
hardness and ripeness of the seeds

487
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
inside of that plant so

488
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,079
that was a good rant for the same

489
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
question i've been asked a lot of times

490
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,558
this one pops up at least once a month

491
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,000
i'm hoping uh and this person has

492
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,240
already heard it this is the gonna be

493
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,359
the third time that they've heard me say

494
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,079
that you set your timer to 12 12 and

495
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,719
that is day one of flowering that's when

496
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,879
you start counting flowering days if i

497
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
wrote 10 weeks on the seed package that

498
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,520
means you've got to let it finish week

499
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,558
10 don't let it go to week 10 and cut it

500
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,359
down let it go through week 10 and cut

501
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,440
it down possibly for funsies let it go a

502
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,959
little bit longer

503
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,558
all right now since we're on this uh

504
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
sort of a path this topic here here's

505
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,319
something funny that i see on social

506
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,759
media all the time and i understand why

507
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,038
you're doing it i understand what

508
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,558
inspires

509
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,558
this sort of a thought process but i

510
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,480
think that this is funny a lot of times

511
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,038
on social media i will see something

512
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,679
that says something like uh i'm only two

513
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,960
weeks away from week nine which means

514
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,440
you are in week seven so just say i'm in

515
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,679
week seven don't like i'm only two weeks

516
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,240
away from week nine yeah i get it that

517
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,400
you want to make it sound like you're

518
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,798
further for your mind you're tricking

519
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,360
yourself to think i am only this far

520
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,400
away but just be realistic with yourself

521
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,798
just say

522
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,480
i am in the end of week six a lot of

523
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,160
people are saying i'm two weeks away

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,480
from week nine and they're technically

525
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
in the end of week six be realistic with

526
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
yourself

527
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,360
uh that way you have realistic

528
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
expectations you know your timeline i

529
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,839
get it it's like little kids saying uh

530
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,400
it's only one month till christmas i'm

531
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,879

too excited for christmas let's be

534
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,558
patient let's look at it realistically

535
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,000
that just makes me giggle on social

536
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,399
media when i see that sort of stuff

537
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,558
nothing personal uh no hatred just makes

538
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
me laugh uh let's see what the next

539
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,519

message

546
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,400
this one comes from another friend who

547
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,279
calls themselves heaven and hell

548
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,280
and their question says hey hey hey

549

master rasta jeff the man with the magic

550
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,359
breath i didn't know that that was a

551
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
thing but that is a great way to start a

552
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,479
message what's up bro good to meet you

553
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,279
that is one hell of an intro it says i

554
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,519
was wondering what nutrient line you

555
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,000
would recommend for your top three

556
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,720
brands please that is a great question

557
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,720
that is an ever evolving ever-changing

558
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
question for me because i do

559
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,558
get to try a lot of different products i

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
get scent free things i get sent samples

561
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,519
i get asked to try things my friends

562
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,760
give me a lot of input and a lot of

563
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,879
feedback on products they're using uh

564
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,400
when i was working in a lot of

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
commercial environments i had a lot of

566
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,519
space and places to experiment with new

567
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,279
stuff

568
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,679
i keep going back to a few of the same

569
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,480
things so let's talk about the top three

570
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,798
that i would recommend for a very long

571
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,679
time i was having great success with the

572
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:35,759
botanic hairline i was using botanicaire

573
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,440
pureblend pro liquid karma the calmag

574
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,919
uh the silica blast the hydra guard or

575
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
hydroplex maybe both

576
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,720
um

577
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,319
there's another one then a couple other

578
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,679
great products there's a bloom booster

579
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,359
that i can't think of the name of right

580
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,038
now they had a few other products that

581
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,639
they were adding to their mix then i

582
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,158
would add a couple other key things of

583
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,159
course i always add a couple of stuff

584
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
whenever i get a a brand i like to add a

585
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
couple of things but i was having great

586
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,279
success with botanicare

587
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,000
um unfortunately there were some

588
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,798
political reasons why i chose to kind of

589
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,119
sway away from botanica it was mainly

590
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,519
political reasons and i was seeing great

591
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,759
success with another brand let's talk

592
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,519
about the other brand the other brand i

593
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,240
switched to that i have great success

594
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,400
with and i still use on a regular basis

595
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,400
is new millennium bottled nutrients i

596
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
think new millennium is great uh the way

597
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
it's formulated the way it's uh just the

598
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
way it's measured out it's easy to work

599
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
with

600
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,798
it makes the plants grow with great

601
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,798
vigor they come out good potency they

602
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,400
taste good they finish on time they've

603
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,480
got products that help us finish they've

604
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,159
got products that help them root

605
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,679
the way the nutrients are broken down

606
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
and the bottles are broken down makes a

607
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,240
lot of sense their nutrient calculator

608
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,918
and schedule is easy to follow uh jiren

609
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
and neil are good people they've got

610
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,960
good customer service and honestly

611
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
nobody pays me uh to talk about this i

612
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,319
don't have big jugs of new millennium

613
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,319
bottles sitting around or anything like

614
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,678
that i'll actually bump into jiren at a

615
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,879
couple of concerts this weekend and

616
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
we'll say what's up and give each other

617
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
a fist bump and won't talk about

618
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
business at all so they do not pay me to

619
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
advertise their brand they don't give me

620
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,799
free stuff they did give me a free hat

621
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,038
and i've gotten a few free bottles but

622
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,119
it's not uh it's there's nothing they

623
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,359
don't pay me to advertise i'm saying

624
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,119
it's good [ __ ] i have to buy it and i

625
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,719
still go buy it at the groce store most

626
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,359
of the time so

627
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,600
new millennium good [ __ ] uh it's easy to

628
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,678
understand also

629
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,079
botanicare is a good product i switched

630
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,080
using it because mainly for political

631
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,158
reasons if you aren't too worried about

632
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,399
uh dollars and ethics and political

633
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
stuff botanicare makes a great product

634
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
just think about where your money's

635
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,439
going maybe pay attention to that sort

636
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,840
of stuff on the botanicare website they

637
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,080
have a great nutrient calculator you can

638
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,918
type in which bottles you've got how

639
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,519
many weeks of veg you expect to do how

640
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,759
many weeks of flour you expect and it

641
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,480
will tell you every week what to feed

642
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,079
those plants and that makes it very easy

643
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
so there are two brands that i really

644
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,079
enjoyed using that was botanicare and

645
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,360
new millennium i also had good

646
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,720
experience with vegbloom from hydroponic

647
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,879
research they make a lot of good

648
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,798
products i think that is a great product

649
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,159
for a commercial grow environment i've

650
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,079
talked a lot about veg bloom and

651
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,120
commercial grow environments really good

652
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:14,639
stuff i know you asked for three but i

653
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,119
also want to recommend biobiz biobiz

654
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,360
makes an affordable product very easy to

655
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,639
use and the product that your finished

656
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,000
flowers will taste so good with biobiz

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,159
good [ __ ]

658
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,319
now with all of that being said let me

659
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,159
make a couple of recommendations

660
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,558
you may be very limited with what is

661
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,400
available to you in your area i don't

662
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,759
know if you're shopping online i don't

663
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,840
know if you're shopping at a local

664
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,240
hydroponic store or a gardening center

665
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,158
or whatever is available where you are

666
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,720
if you're going to the store to get what

667
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,240
is available i recommend you shop around

668
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,079
and get what is there on the shelf so

669
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,159
you don't have to pay extra for shipping

670
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,000
shipping costs are expensive sending

671
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,720
bottles of water across the country can

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,960
get ridiculous maybe find something at

673
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,159
the local grow store that will suit your

674
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
needs

675
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,640
maybe do some research on brands i was

676
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,880
talking earlier that one brand i really

677
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,440
enjoyed i switch because of political

678
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,039
and other reasons maybe read about who

679
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,558
is attached to who who are the parent

680
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,879
companies who are the umbrella companies

681
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,038
to that company if that matters to you

682
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,440
pay attention to that sort of stuff it

683
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,679
may be easier for you to find products

684
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,840
locally they may be more reliable it may

685
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,679
be easier for you to build your arsenal

686
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,519
up that way slowly over time locally

687
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,200
than it would be to have stuff shipped

688
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,278
maybe you can't have grow products

689
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360
shipped straight to your house sometimes

690
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,359
if you order bottles of grow nutrients

691
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,119
it will come just as that bottle of grow

692
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,959
nutrients with plastic wrap wrapped

693
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,879
around it and then some sort of security

694
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
tape around the the lid so it doesn't

695
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,480
come popped open so the whole

696
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
neighborhood knows you just got a bottle

697
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,278
of whatever pureblend pro organic tea

698
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,120
sitting on the front porch until you got

699
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,200
home from work it just sat out there all

700
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,439
day who knows who drove by who knows who

701
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,600
was walking the dogs and saw that who

702
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,200
knows how many other neighborhood kids

703
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,798
walked by and they grow weed too and

704
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
they know what the [ __ ] you got now they

705
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,000
know that you grow weed so that's

706
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,159
something to think about where are you

707
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
going to source your products where are

708
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
they going to come from can you get it

709
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
at your local groce store

710
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,519
there was something else i wanted to add

711
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,278
to that the nutrient calculators go look

712
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,079
at all of the nutrient calculators and

713
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,759
nutrient schedules on line check out the

714
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,359
website for the brand that you intend to

715
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,038
use

716
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,439
try to stick with if you're picking a

717
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,200
brand i say that i like adding stuff try

718
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,038
to start with the brand and like if

719
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,360
you're going to use let's just say that

720
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,879
you're going to use new millennium

721
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,240
new millennium actually sells a great

722
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
starter pack

723
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,079
get that starter pack and use their

724
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,320
website for their nutrient calculator

725
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,918
and feed it like it says on the nutrient

726
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,720
calculator if you can't get all of the

727
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,038
stuff

728
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
on your wish list start with the basics

729
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,879
that you need now you need like a base

730
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,120
are you in veg or in bloom get your

731
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,720
bases for that then get your cal mag

732
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,639
then get your rooting supplements then

733
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,159
get your bloom boosters and just add

734
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
them over time and then after you

735
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,000
harvest maybe if your next run get a

736
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,080
couple of more bottles if you didn't run

737
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,519
out think of it as every time you go to

738
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,798
the store you can get one or two more

739
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,480
bottles like when you were a kid you're

740
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,240
just trying to expand your lego sets or

741
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,079
whatever you're doing get another game

742
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,240
for the playstation think of it like

743
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,798
that now just invest in new bottles

744
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,880
every time you go then find a brand that

745
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,720
you like if you decide you don't like it

746
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
it's okay to switch there's no problem

747
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,480
with brand loyalty in this industry you

748
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,000
can switch brands you can switch

749
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,599
mid-grow if you really want to the

750
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,038
plants don't care as long as they're

751
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,719
getting fed and getting what they need

752
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,079
the plants may be happier if you switch

753
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,759
if you went from a shitty product to a

754
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,639
better product they're eating better

755
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,400
they may be happier but learn a product

756
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
see if you like it run a crop or two

757
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,640
with that run a crop or two with other

758
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,000
stuff maybe if you can afford the space

759
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,559
and the products and the time and the

760
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
energy maybe do two side-by-sides maybe

761
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,079
do a new millennium run and uh whatever

762
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,440
a botanical run and maybe um a bio biz

763
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,439
run and then some other brand that's

764
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,960
local at your store that's available do

765
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
those runs all together and see what

766
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,319
works best for you i know you asked for

767
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,200
three i'm going to say

768
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,519
new millennium bottle nutrients

769
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,360
botanicare and

770
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,960
hydroponic research is veg bloom

771
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,879
products that's probably my top three

772
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
favorites the veg bloom is my favorite

773
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,720
for commercial growing if i wasn't doing

774
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,759
commercial growing i'd probably swap

775
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,240
that one out with biobiz for my third

776
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,000
reply all right i think i've been

777
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,519
rambling on for long enough it feels

778
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
