86
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,280

words i like to use for him

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,878
uh that those are great people i always

89
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,560
had a good time talking to him i did

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,318
troll him a little bit

91
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
uh but that was the relationship that we

92
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,598
had we trolled each other we poked each

93
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,719
other i gave him a hard time he gave me

94
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,318
a hard time

95
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,759
it was to encourage each other when i'm

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,280
trolling you and poking you

97
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,518
it's a gentle way of showing you that

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,919
there is a better way i'm encouraging

99
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
you

100
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,439
we're just enlightening each other it's

101
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
how bros and guys do it i'll do it to

102
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,759
the ladies

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
too but we had kind of a trolly

104
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,199
relationship with each other

105
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
and it was fun i just hope he knows that

106
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,238
i had nothing but love

107
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,919
and respect and that our friendly

108
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,120
bickering was nothing but

109
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,158
two old guys friendly arguing bickering

110
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,158
is too old guys

111
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,199
so stoney i hope you always took me with

112
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,039
a grain of salt

113
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,958
i hope you always knew i was giving you

114
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,039
my [ __ ] with tongue-in-cheek

115
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
i had nothing but love still got nothing

116
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,079
but love and respect for stony scholar

117
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,759
uh i think i'm still in shock and pissed

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
off and angry that he's gone

119
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,079

that we'd give him a shout out for being

168
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
a generous dude being a cantankerous

169
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
dude

170
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,400

never seemed dishonest he was too

172
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,198
cantankerous and honoring to tell a lie

173
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,639
he'd rather tell you the dirty truth

174
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,079
with his tongue in his cheek and look at

175
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,918
you sideways and be like actually you

176
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
look like a [ __ ] idiot in that shirt

177
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,879
you would never tell you look good in

178
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,799
something he didn't look good in that

179
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159

people that you miss or that you don't

200

226
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
was to drive each other

227
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
i come on here and i seem like i am the

228
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
cannabis guru i'm the one teaching i'm

229
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
the one

230
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
uh spreading the knowledge and sharing

231
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,318

everybody stoney never failed to teach

235
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,318
me something he had new ideas

236
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,240
he was innovative he had completely

237
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
different thought processes we think in

238
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
a completely different way

239
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,359
which i enjoy and respect those are the

240
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,959
kind of friends i like to be surrounded

241
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,879
by i don't need a bunch of friends that

242
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,638
all love reggae and fish and all want to

243
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,959
grow weed and do all the same exact [ __ ]

244
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
or we end up doing the same exact [ __ ]

245
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,399
i love that he was different than me

246
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,199
that he was a good dude so

247
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,038
um i think if i just keep going i'm

248
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
rambling and this will get emotional

249

so we've become the embracing organics

00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,559
family and yes sometimes there are

319
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,080
riffs in the force and groups have

320
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,439
bickering and whatnot but hopefully

321
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
something like this will show

322
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
a lot of the younger kids that we got to

323
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
put the [ __ ] away

324
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
we got to be friends we got to love one

325
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,959
another we got to respect each other not

326
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,838
just in each group but in the community

327
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,479
and the world

328
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,440

352
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,039
put down the iphones put down the ipads

353
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,078
spend some eye to eye contact with the

354
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,679
people that we love

355
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,679
i'm gonna heat up a dab nail i'm gonna

356
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,120
take a fat dab in honor of my buddy

357
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,239
stoney scholar

358
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,839
i think i'm just going to let the

359
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
credits roll by or something like that

360
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
while i take this dab maybe i'll play

361
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
some music or something

362
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,559
i don't want to make the video too long

363
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,639
and redundant and obnoxious

364
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,799
so once again i want to send a giant

365
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,039
shout out to my buddy stoney scholar

366
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,078
stay tuned he did leave behind a wife

367
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,639
who is now

368
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,000
she does not have a husband who uh i can

369
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,679
only imagine what it would be like to

370
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
lose your partner in life

371
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,799
part of the income is gone it's not just

372
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,560
the income it's the stability

373
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,958
the emotional support that person's been

374
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,278
there next to you every waking hour

375
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,000
that's going to be a huge adjustment i

376
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,360
am sure

377
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
that there will be some sort of

378
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
fundraising for mrs

379
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,399

380
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,039
her feet

381
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
emotionally uh physically financially we

382
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,240
need to make sure that there's

383
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,919
a rent paid uh some food in the

384
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
refrigerator and that she's got

385
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,039
the best smile that she could possibly

386
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,639
get while her husband is gone and she's

387
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,278
