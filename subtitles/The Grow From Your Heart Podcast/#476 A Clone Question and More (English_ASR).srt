show on patreon if you would like to

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:55,850
learn how to support the show you can do

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:55,850
so by visiting www.azcleanelections.gov

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,959
Cocco based organic grow my media is

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,799
cocoa that is heavily amended with crab

42
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,408
shell bone meal green sand etc the media

43
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,920
gets recycled Andrea mended then put

44
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,019
into 20 gallon fabric pots for veg I had

45
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,539
an issue with a magnesium deficiency

46
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,280
because of the recycled cocoa I have

47
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,259
corrected this by rebuffering and

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,090
soaking the media with mag from

49
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,578
cutting-edge solutions and adding some

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,680
dolomite lime my question is about

51
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:45,840
seedlings and clones well let's back up

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,400
before we get to the question you were

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,950
using Coco you were trying to stay

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,389
organic so you are recycling your coco

55
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:52,979
than you were rebuffering it because

56
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:54,719
you've had what you assume is a

57
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,149
magnesium deficiency that does make

58
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,680
sense in Coco those nutrients aren't

59
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,569
going to stick around they rinse out of

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,099
your media really quickly so it is very

61
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:03,988
likely you were getting a magnesium

62
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,238
deficiency it sounds like you have

63
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,188
corrected that this is a very unique

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,769
blend I don't know anybody else that is

65
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,658
using purely Coco as their base and then

66
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,789
amending it with things like crab shell

67
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,530
bone meal and green sand most folks are

68
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,840
using some sort of a peat or a soilless

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,180
mix to add to that so I find this to be

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,579
a rather unique mix but let's focus more

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,219
on the question it says my question is

72
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,079
about seedlings and clones I never had

73
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,030
any issues before my magnesium

74
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,519
deficiency but while that was happening

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,949
I could not get anything to clone or

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,560
root do you think it's because of the

77
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,169
lower cation exchange with the stripped

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,848
cocoa now while you were experiencing

79
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,439
this deficiency which we will assume was

80
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:45,209
probably a calcium and magnesium

81
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,158
deficiency they're usually going to come

82
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,009
together you were having problems

83
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,929
getting your clones to root now I'm not

84
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:54,089
sure if you mean you were trying to root

85
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,040
your clones directly into the cocoa mix

86
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,289
because that I would never suggest

87
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,789
trying to route clones directly into

88
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,858
cocoa that's not something I would do

89
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,780
there are much more options that are

90
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,489
much more successful for taking clones

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,469
so if that is what is giving you the

92
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,299
problem then I would recommend moving to

93
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,400
either an easy cloner or if you're

94
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,159
insistent on keeping it organic you can

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,959
move right over to the rapid rooters or

96
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,089
whatever type of plugs and use the dome

97
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,370
set up but I would not suggest going

98
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,348
directly into cocoa to attempt to cut a

99
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,449
clone now that may not be what you mean

100
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:26,610
let's talk the other route you may be

101
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,569
experiencing problems when you were

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,639
cutting clones in

103
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,709
to rapid Reuters into a dome however

104
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,479
you're doing it from these plants which

105
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,000
experience that deficiency and that is

106
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,009
very likely I'm going to assume that you

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,779
were talking about the clone donor

108
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,849
plants were the plants that experienced

109
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,829
this deficiency we took clones from

110
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,170
those plants they were not up to their

111
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,849
optimal health so it is very likely that

112
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,949
those clones will become stagnant

113
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,570
and not root well for you so I am going

114
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,949
to hope and assume that that is the case

115
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,599
you had that deficiency

116
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,849
you took clones from a plant that was

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,740
unhealthy and those clones were like now

118
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,689
I came from an unhealthy environment I

119
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,699
don't have enough of a start to survive

120
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,620
this stressful period and they just

121
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,259
burned out and died on you that is

122
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,600
probably the case and it wouldn't matter

123
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,370
what your media was if your plants are

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,230
unhealthy and you take cuts from them

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,389
they are probably going to be struggle

126
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,129
but the entire time now I'm not sure if

127
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,050
you were trying to route into the cocoa

128
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,459
which again I would not suggest if that

129
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,889
is your issue then I would recommend

130
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,979
moving over to the plug or another type

131
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,870
of a cloning setup if you were taking

132
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,060
clones from those plants that experience

133
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,920
the deficiencies I'm going to assume

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,500
that the problem was unhealthy mother

135
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,480
plants and the only solution is to nurse

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,829
those plants back to health and then

137
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,750
take clones from them again and

138
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,729
hopefully the clones from the healthier

139
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,829
mother plants will work better for you

140
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,420
this person did not sign the email with

141
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,879
their name but they said thanks Jeff

142
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,680
stay lifted I promise you I will stay

143
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,230
lifted if you would like to send me an

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,480
update to this question maybe a part two

145
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,250
and let me know if you were trying to

146
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,840
clone off of a plant that was unhealthy

147
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,269
or if you were actually trying to clone

148
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,979
directly into the amended Coco maybe we

149
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,589
could sort out your question and get you

150
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,000
a more dialed in solution either way I

151
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,489
want to thank you for the great email

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,100
and let's keep moving through the pile

153
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,840
of great questions this next email goes

154
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,189
a lot like this a Rasta Jeff so first of

155
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,959
all I just want to thank you for the

156
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,569
podcast the awesome stuff you're doing

157
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,279
with your genetics and the education

158
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,959
you're spreading around the world

159
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,549
I'm from pretty much the middle of

160
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,859
nowhere Canada and it's been

161
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,710
surprisingly difficult to get decent

162
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,980
reliable advice and your show has been

163
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:37,319
one of the best places for me to go man

164
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,850
that is a great opening line first off

165
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,189
they thanked us for the podcast you were

166
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,570
very welcome thank you for listening

167
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,550
awesome stuff I'm doing with the

168
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,709
genetics thank you for noticing and then

169
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,210
the education I'm spreading around the

170
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,859
world that is awesome that you notice

171
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,199
and thank you for listening all the way

172
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,420
up there in the middle of nowhere Canada

173
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,979
and like a lot of people say it is hard

174
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,780
for them to get reliable information

175
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,490
I've mentioned before that a lot of

176
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,739
stuff on the internet will steer you in

177
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,540
the completely wrong direction and I do

178
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,460
understand that finding reliable

179
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,020
accurate information can be challenging

180
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,029
so I'm glad you have found the show ah

181
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,729
let's continue with the message it says

182
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,099
so far I've read a few grow books and

183
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,530
Bibles as well as TLO and I'm just

184
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,939
starting on the teeming with series you

185
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:19,139
guys make sure you check out the teeming

186
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,149
with series there's teeming with

187
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,319
microbes teeming with nutrients and

188
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,549
there might be another one that I'm

189
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,889
missing I can't think of it but let's

190
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,540
just keep moving aside from all of that

191
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,759
I tend to listen to your show in the

192
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,800
afternoons and the dude grow show in the

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,539
mornings while I work in the trades as a

194
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,920
painter big shout out to our friends at

195
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,780
the dude gross show if you're not

196
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,280
listening to the dude gross show make

197
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,049
sure you find them whatever you're

198
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,669
listening to my podcast on the dude

199
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,680
gross show is available there as well

200
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,750
just type in dude gross it will pop up

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,639
give them a subscribe let them know

202
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,170
Rasta Jeff sent you so our friend is

203
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,419
listening to this podcast in the

204
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,150
afternoons and the dude grows in the

205
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,250
morning while painting I appreciate that

206
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,659
you were getting a cannabis education

207
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,399
while you were at work you're on the

208
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,260
clock and you were absorbing useful

209
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,299
knowledge bettering yourself while

210
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,860
making a paycheck great way to do life

211
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,079
let's keep moving with the message it

212
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,569
says on that note between both shows

213
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,509
I've gotten to dispel a few bad pieces

214
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,849
of info I've gotten from people it seems

215
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,279
that in Saskatchewan our farming culture

216
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,960
leads people to be really stubborn and

217
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,559
suggestive about their [ __ ]

218
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,750
gardening miracle solutions yes a lot of

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,430
people do things that their uncle's

220
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,110
brother taught them and they don't know

221
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,000
why they're doing it they just heard

222
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,530
some [ __ ] and they do it and then I say

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,659
why do you do that and they go well my

224
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,218
uncle said and I go yeah but do you see

225
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,809
any results from it they go well my

226
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,700
uncle said that my brother said that

227
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,829
when they did it and there's no real

228
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,780
scientific background or no reason it's

229
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,850
just another step it's probably a waste

230
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,129
of time it may actually be causing more

231
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,409
problems than its helping so I do see a

232
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:51,779
lot of [ __ ] gardening miracle

233
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,699
solutions I'm gonna keep going with the

234
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,419
message it says for example last night I

235
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,790
popped in

236
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,349
your live feed on Instagram and I asked

237
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:00,750
you about dipping the root ball into

238
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,450
boiling water before hanging the plants

239
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,480
to dry you immediately said that that is

240
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,860
an old wives tale yeah I hear I've heard

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,899
that for a long time now that when you

242
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,269
cut down the plant if you dunk the root

243
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,799
ball in boiling water it makes more

244
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,539
trichomes appear on the plant but

245
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,490
doesn't really make any sense and even

246
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,679
if it did work why would you want a

247
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,299
bunch of unripened trichome so we've had

248
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,948
those trichomes on that plant for weeks

249
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,208
now they've been getting ripe we've been

250
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:26,399
checking on with the scope making sure

251
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:28,500
they're amber why do we want fresh

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,169
trichomes on there suddenly at the end

253
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,289
also [ __ ] not going to happen it

254
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:36,059
says I was also told another trick of

255
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:39,179
watering your plants with carbonated

256
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,979
water for extra co2 and that again is

257
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,828
just craziness that doesn't actually

258
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,028
work yes that's absolutely accurate

259
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:48,059
watering your plants with carbonated

260
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:50,610
water will not increase co2 the roots do

261
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,588
not want co2 the roots want oxygen the

262
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,019
plants want the co2 so you're doing that

263
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,760
all wrong these are perfect examples of

264
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,470
some of the things that will cause more

265
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,850
problems in the grow then they will

266
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,850
actually help so we need to be very

267
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,259
careful where we get our information

268
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,300
this message keeps going it says but

269
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,610
despite all of this I have managed to

270
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:11,669
keep my first grow from failing and I've

271
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,620
got a few BC blueberry plants rockin and

272
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,448
I'm just about to flip into flower I

273
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,669
kinda wish I had found your podcast

274
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,659
earlier as I would have avoided a few

275
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,698
mistakes

276
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,439
it's very ok that you have made a few

277
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:24,838
mistakes that's how you learn you know

278
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,399
not what not to do next time you've seen

279
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,560
what happens when you do that so you

280
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,669
know maybe I shouldn't try that again or

281
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,009
maybe I could try that a little

282
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:34,198
differently you learn from your mistakes

283
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,149
I've done a full episode about that so

284
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,679
it's okay to make mistakes especially at

285
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,750
your stage of the learning experience

286
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,269
you're a white belt you've got a long

287
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,948
way to go before you're a black belt

288
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,269
you're gonna make a lot more mistakes so

289
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:47,458
don't be scared now let's keep going

290
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,929
with the message it says anyways instead

291
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,818
of asking you questions about my

292
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:54,239
specific grow I wanted to pick your

293
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:56,578
brain about a few larger concepts first

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,740
of all being a lighting spectrum

295
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,809
experiment I heard you mention that the

296
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,519
Sun puts the plants to sleep because of

297
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,979
the spectrum it generates throughout the

298
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,019
day so let's say you rigged up three

299
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,830
lights with dimmer switches one light

300
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,779
with the blues

301
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,400
trim comes on using the dimmer as it

302
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,559
gets brighter the middle light with the

303
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,959
white spectrum turns on while the blue

304
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,929
spectrum dims off a red spectrum light

305
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,940
comes on then as the day goes on the

306
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,529
white light dims off leaving only the

307
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,360
red spectrum which again will shut off

308
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,179
using the dimmer toward the end of the

309
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,100
day I am new to your podcast but has

310
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,859
this been covered on an episode of yours

311
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,259
if not are there any advantages of

312
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,789
trying this now let's talk a little bit

313
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,220
about what this person is referring to

314
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:41,730
in a previous episode I have talked

315
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,100
about far red light spectrums as the Sun

316
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,279
sets it puts off a spectrum what is

317
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,430
called far read that far red light

318
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,319
spectrum triggers a hormone and a

319
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:56,069
protein in the plant known as

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,830
phytochrome red that hormone tells the

321
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,710
plant it is nighttime so even though

322
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,410
there is still light in the sky that

323
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,269
plant is being told it is sleepy time so

324
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:09,179
it shuts down and starts doing its

325
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,069
nighttime productivity so that hormone

326
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,009
in that plant triggers a protein in that

327
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,110
plant and that is triggered by a certain

328
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,600
spectrum that comes from the Sun so this

329
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,269
listener is asking if they can set up

330
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,389
different kelvin raiding lights to

331
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:27,750
attempt to simulate the rising the

332
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:30,929
midday and the sunset spectrums of the

333
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,269
natural Sun this is a very good idea and

334
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,250
this would work very well in theory the

335
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:39,419
thing we need to focus more carefully on

336
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,549
is specific spectrums of lighting to put

337
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,299
the plants to sleep I do believe we need

338
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:46,829
a specific UV spectrum of lighting that

339
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,729
does not come from our standard

340
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,440
fluorescence or our HID lights the only

341
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,509
people I know putting out a light with

342
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,030
that spectrum at this time our spectrum

343
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,710
King I may be wrong our friends from

344
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:00,569
Canon may have produced a light with the

345
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,129
same spectrum there may be other brands

346
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,470
out there putting out the light with the

347
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,750
far red feature but to the best of my

348
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,879
knowledge at this time spectrum King is

349
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,759
the only brand offering that light again

350
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,679
I'm saying I may be wrong and by the

351
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,779
time this episode comes out or by the

352
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,629
time you listen to this episode there

353
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,360
could be 5 10 or 20 new brands that have

354
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:23,730
been launched so your idea would work

355
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,740
in theory however we need to dial in the

356
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,610
specific spectrums I don't think that

357
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,190
your basic red uh t5 light or t8 light

358
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,829
or any type of HID light is going to

359
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,140
produce that red spectrum so unless you

360
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:38,609
dial in the perfect spectrum for that

361
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,039
far red lighting to trigger that

362
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,019
phytochrome red response I think that

363
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,699
would probably be possibly more

364
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,950
stressful to the plant than it would be

365
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,750
beneficial to change that light spectrum

366
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,000
throughout the day like that a more

367
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,009
common practice is to use a bluer bulb

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,049
during the veg phase because we want the

369
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,850
plants to stay short and stocky and then

370
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:58,708
toward the flowering phase we usually

371
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,450
tend to move toward the redder bulbs

372
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,549
because that encourages fatter bud

373
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,730
growth in a lot of cases now we're

374
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:07,708
seeing mixed spectrums we're seeing high

375
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,200
pressure sodium bulbs in flower rooms

376
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:12,088
with a few metal halide bulbs in flower

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,579
rooms just to add to the spectrum and

378
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm also seeing people put ceramic metal

379
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:18,750
halides in rooms I'm also seeing LEDs

380
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,420
and then I'm seeing mixtures and

381
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,070
combinations of all of the above

382
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:24,778
sometimes I feel like these combos don't

383
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,060
work because of the patterns in which

384
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:29,370
the lights are laid sometimes I feel

385
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,739
like it's a bit overkill but sometimes I

386
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,480
do see really great results from rooms

387
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,028
that are thought out with mixed

388
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,490
spectrums so your idea is great in

389
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:41,189
theory but if you are not dialing in the

390
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,440
exact red light spectrum it is not worth

391
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,050
the energy because it is not going to

392
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,540
trigger the phytochrome red response you

393
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,689
are looking for now let's keep moving

394
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,969
there is more to this email it goes on

395
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,279
to say now lastly and I'm sorry I know

396
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,379
this is getting long-winded but because

397
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,259
of my issues with getting bad info in my

398
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:04,799
area my plants were getting sick and I

399
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,480
was almost ready to quit then I was on

400
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,399
the road with my band and I tried to

401
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,379
purchase some legal cannabis from a

402
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,639
company he names the company here but

403
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,948
I'm going to leave their name out I

404
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,319
tried to purchase legal cannabis from a

405
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:18,659
company and it was [ __ ] atrocious and

406
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,970
then he also says it happened to be one

407
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,799
of my favorite strains which was Sour

408
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,300
tangi so that sucks when you go to the

409
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,549
store and he try to buy your favorite

410
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,620
strain and it is atrocious is the word

411
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,778
this person used so they continue it

412
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,259
says all day I was thinking how I can

413
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,899
get involved and

414
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:37,178
this then suddenly an opportunity to

415
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,798
work at a grouse nor presented itself

416
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:40,988
isn't it great how life just seems to

417
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:43,539
open doors for you like that the message

418
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:45,309
keeps going it says I've heard you say

419
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:47,228
but you get out of this plant what you

420
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:50,249
put into it and I know that that is

421
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:52,869
absolutely true so my question to you is

422
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,999
what would you like to see in a grouse

423
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,788
store or even a grouse store employee

424
00:15:54,999 --> 00:16:00,038
and what kind of practices do you think

425
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:01,958
should be promoted I'm not looking for

426
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:04,359
product recommendations or anything I'm

427
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,758
just wondering if you were to go into a

428
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,829
grouse store what would really impress

429
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,288
you that is a great question he wraps it

430
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,808
up by saying being Canadian I will

431
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:15,850
apologize again for the [ __ ] novel of

432
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,409
an email here hey it's a great email

433
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,879
don't apologize I love all the

434
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,100
information I'm able to share and that

435
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,379
comes from good questions so it also

436
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,329
says hearing you talk on your show and

437
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,949
then finding out you're also a drummer I

438
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:30,038
just had to get these couple of things

439
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:32,019
out mostly just a big THANK YOU but also

440
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:34,119
to see your thoughts on these things

441
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,038
then they say thanks again for

442
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,359
everything and they signed their name I

443
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,249
don't know if they want their name set

444
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:41,739
on the show so big thank you to my new

445
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:44,199
Canadian drummer friend who has a new

446
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:47,769
job at a grouse store who wants to know

447
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,688
what do I find valuable in a grouse

448
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,889
store or a grouse store employee that's

449
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:53,198
a very good question

450
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,778
oftentimes when I go to the grouse store

451
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,719
I run into the same exact problems I run

452
00:16:55,778 --> 00:17:01,149
into when I go to the music store I am a

453
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,730
very experienced and confident grower

454
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:06,699
and I'm a very experienced and confident

455
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,009
drummer when I go to the store to update

456
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,199
or replace my gear I know what I want

457
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:13,388
I've done some shopping I've gone on the

458
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,370
internet I have used equipment I've

459
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:17,109
shopped around I know what I want when I

460
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,859
walk in there and I say hey I would like

461
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,788
to buy product f6 355 and the person at

462
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,818
the counter looks at you with an

463
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:27,308
attitude because you like f6 355 that

464
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:28,808
brand sucks I like this brand and

465
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,308
depending on where you are you get a

466
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:31,960
different attitude at the grocer they go

467
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:33,819
bruh I use this and my growth comes out

468
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,110
way better and if you're a guitar centre

469
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,119
they [ __ ] twirl their hair they go

470
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:39,878
brah I play these and they sound way

471
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,109
better like don't be that guy if

472
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:43,658
somebody goes in there and they know

473
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:46,089
what they want confidently get it off of

474
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,680
the shelf and sell them extra

475
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:50,470
to go with it don't tell them their

476
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,060
product sucks ever if somebody walks in

477
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,730
and wants to buy something and they have

478
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,740
got cash you take their [ __ ] cash and

479
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,170
give them the product they asked for

480
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,759
don't ever belittle your customers your

481
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,190
customers are paying your rent

482
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,319
appreciate them so if somebody's buying

483
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,539
a product you do not approve of if you

484
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,849
think you can help somebody increase the

485
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,920
potential of their grow let them

486
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:14,709
purchase the product that they choose to

487
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,320
buy then the next time you see them say

488
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,670
hey I saw you were buying Fox farms and

489
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,369
we all know Fox farms is like

490
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,410
entry-level gross stuff say there's this

491
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,849
new company and they offer this and

492
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,160
we're going to have a sale on this

493
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:29,379
product next month I thought you may be

494
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,670
interested tell them why it would be a

495
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,010
step up from whatever they're using

496
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,529
don't belittle their [ __ ] let them buy

497
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:38,170
what they want to buy then next time

498
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:41,079
suggest the step up don't belittle

499
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,759
encourage growth so that's probably the

500
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,889
first most important piece of advice

501
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,420
that comes to my mind don't belittle me

502
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,220
because if the products I want to buy

503
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,750
and don't tell me how your product is

504
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,059
better and don't just try to put

505
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,609
yourself on me while I'm shopping I'm

506
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,859
not there for you I'm there for me to

507
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:58,359
buy [ __ ] for my grow so make me feel

508
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:59,829
like I'm the important one there make

509
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,189
your customer feel like the important

510
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:04,809
one there then get a very good

511
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,420
cultivation knowledge and have a good

512
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,490
glossary of terms understand the proper

513
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,050
words to use understand the parts of the

514
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,450
plan to understand the nutrients

515
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,549
understand the equipment understand what

you're selling don't try to sell people

517
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:20,019
[ __ ] just to make Commission sell them

518
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,150
what you think they will need and they

519
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:23,470
will come back and buy more [ __ ] from

520
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,630
you and you will still make your

521
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,670
Commission don't force-feed anybody any

522
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,140
products now a lot of what I'm telling

523
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,420
you I have learned in basic sales

524
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,150
schools a lot of time learn your

525
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,670
products and always have a good better

526
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,800
and best recommendation if I walk in and

527
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,140
I say hey I need something to do this

528
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,659
say oh here's the section where we keep

529
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,520
that here's one that you can get here's

530
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,830
the middle priced one this one's the

531
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,809
best then back up let me make my

532
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,699
decision don't force-feed me a product

533
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,289
if you see that I'm going for the one in

534
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,809
the middle and I may need something to

535
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,220
go with that be a good sales guy have my

536
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:59,829
back and go oh if you're gonna get that

537
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,269
you may also want this to go with it

538
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:03,038
when I get to the register that's when

539
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,870
you've got the opportunity to upsell me

540
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,190
do I have personal protective equipment

541
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,168
do I have gloves

542
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,509
do I have goggles do I have a facemask

543
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:12,610
there's always [ __ ] to upsell but make

544
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,769
sure you get what I need before you

545
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,148
upsell me on some [ __ ] don't just try to

546
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:18,009
get money out of my pocket without

547
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,538
sending me out of there happy if you

548
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,759
send me out of the grocery with a smile

549
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:23,679
I'll spend all my money but if you

550
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,390
bother me and you upset my shopping

551
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,009
experience I won't give you any of my

552
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,080
money I'll go somewhere where they do it

553
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:31,028
correctly so that is probably some of

554
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,369
the best advice I can give you that is

555
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,960
just basic sales school stuff be

556
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,518
friendly be knowledgeable don't be a

557
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,048
[ __ ] don't be in there to steal

558
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,849
money from people don't be in there to

559
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,798
get rich be there to help people out

560
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,418
don't pitch products because a company

561
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,308
told you to pitch a product pitch a

562
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,080
product because you believe in it but if

563
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,970
somebody doesn't want that have another

564
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,710
solution another option for them and

565
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,130
here's another great piece of advice

566
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,929
don't ever be afraid to say I don't know

567
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,460
if somebody comes in and they're trying

568
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,110
to tell you they've got a problem or ask

569
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,329
you for some sort of advice and you

570
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:03,969
don't have a solution just say wow I

571
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:06,009
don't know because if you tell me that I

572
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,839
have got this problem and I buy a bunch

573
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,908
of [ __ ] and try to go salute solve that

574
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,888
problem with your solution and all it

575
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,690
does is backtrack me guess who I'm never

576
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:15,638
trusting again guess where I'm never

577
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,950
gonna shop again that's you buddy

578
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:20,589
so give solid advice but don't be afraid

579
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,048
to say I don't know other than that bro

580
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:26,500
follow basic sales class techniques

581
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,940
approach position engage follow-through

582
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,740
it's pretty much all you got to do man

583
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,500
make the sale happen and it will sell

584
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,179
itself be friendly be a good person and

585
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,159

586
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,990

589
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,389
