00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,620
sure that I'm sending seeds to the

199
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,819
correct people I've got the emails

200
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,959
printed out I'm just gonna go make sure

201
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,699
you're giving me the right name the

202
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,680
right email address then I'll get those

203
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,060
seeds shipped out to you I do know that

204
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,379
some people have been skipped and some

205
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,660
people are probably wondering where

206
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,339
their seeds are I apologize for that I

207
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,500
thought I had a better method of keeping

208
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,478
track of those expectations and those

209
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,220
packages I promised and I realized

210
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,079
recently I skipped a few and I have

211
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,120
failed I'm taking full accountability

212
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,620
for that I apologize I'm going to

213
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,978
correct it and I will get those packages

214
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,780
out as soon as possible I do realize now

215
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,639
that the uh the plan the method that I

216
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,799
had for getting those out Simply wasn't

217
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,840
working I was missing messages I will

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
fix it I will get them out like I said

219
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,619
please send me an email with your name

220
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,139
your shipping address the episode that

221
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,418
you won and once again when you send me

222
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,519
a shipping address please put a real

223
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,258
name on your shipping address it doesn't

224
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,560
have to be your real name but I don't

225
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,080
want to send seeds to uh ganja Bob 5000

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,500
or bong Ripper 420 or if you got the

227
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,959
word bong or ganja or plants or weed or

228
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,060
the number 420 in your name please don't

229
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,918
do that that is very suspicious to the

230
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,680
post office they know your name is not

231
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,719
ganja bob420 all that does is make them

232
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,519
wonder what ganja Bob 420 is getting

233
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,620
mailed to them and what the white guy

234
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,060
with dreadlocks sent to them so help us

235
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,978
help each other out when you send me

236
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,199
your address please send me a real name

237
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,418
or at least a name that doesn't look

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,639
suspicious so we can get your package to

239
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:37,439
you safely all right I think we covered

240
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,120
all of the news and the updates here at

241
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,479
the start of the show let's talk about

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,000
some new cannabis content quite often I

243
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,740
get an email asking a very similar line

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,200
of questions people are confused about

245
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,399
something and I want to clear it up here

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,800
on the podcast on many seed vending seed

247
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,759
selling websites you will see that we

248
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,319
state that our seeds do not contain THC

249
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,778
cannabis seeds or hemp seeds if you will

250
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,959
or any seeds for that matter do not

251
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:08,939
contain any THC the reason that we list

252
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,579
that on the websites is because that is

253
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,620
why it is legal to ship seeds to you

254
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,600
through the mail if those seeds

255
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,600
contained cannabinoids if there was any

256
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,879
testable detectable THC within those

257
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,220
seeds we would not be allowed to sell

258
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,740
and or ship those seeds to our customers

259
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,860
so the reason the website says that the

260
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,959
seed itself does not contain any THC is

261
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,659
because of the seed itself does not

262
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,639
contain any THC there seems to be some

263
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,458
confusion because the outcome that comes

264
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,319
from those seeds should May and will be

265
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,599
vastly different than what the seed

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
actually contains so we were able to

267
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,920
send you the seed because it does not

268
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,799
contain any illegal compounds you have

269
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,079
to get that seed then depending on where

270
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,000
you live the laws and regulations in

271
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,560
your location and the amount of

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,659
dedication you want to put into this

273
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,479
project if you choose to grow those

274
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,980
plants that is up to you then maybe they

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
will produce detectable traceable

276
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,600
cannabinoids so the seeds you are buying

277
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,778
do not contain THC they've got less than

278
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,940
0.3 percent THC which makes them able to

279
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:14,759
be sold online and shipped to your door

280
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,560
once you receive those seeds it is up to

281
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,838
you what you do with them many people

282
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,000
keep them as a souvenir as a novelty

283
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,980
collectible as a preservation kit is

284
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,259
what they call it so the seeds we are

285
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,180
sending you do not contain THC if they

286
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,620
took all of the seeds you bought and put

287
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,539
them in a grinder and ground them up and

288
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,480
ran them through a test they will not

289
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:36,000
find any THC which makes them legal for

290
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,440
us to sell and to ship to you once you

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
get the seeds that is your

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,160
responsibility the seeds are sold if

293
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,139
you're in an illegal location where you

294
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,419
should not grow those seeds are sold to

295
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,578
you as a souvenir as a novelty as a

296
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:50,759
collector item or as a genetic

297
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:53,399
preservation kit if cannabis does become

298
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,379
legal in your area at some point or if

299
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,539
you relocate to to a place where those

300
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,039
seeds are legal then at that point you

301
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,679
can grow them out and make the adult

302
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,599
legal decision to cultivate those seeds

303
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,819
at that time that is when the

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,320
cannabinoids will come into play if you

305
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,480
grow that plant correctly you should

306
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,760
reach the potential of the cannabinoids

307
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,459
available in that plant but what we are

308
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,200
sending you will not contain any THC so

309
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,819
when you see that on the website and it

310
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,339
says these seeds contain zero percent

311
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,260
THC we're not saying it's going to grow

312
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,300
something that will not contain THC

313
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:27,419
we're saying what we are sending you has

314
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:30,240
no THC it's up to you to make that THC

315
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,819
happen or do not make it happen if you

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,899
are in an illegal location so I just

317
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
want to make that clear I understand

318
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,639
that can be confusing at one part of the

319
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,839
website it'll say zero percent THC and

320
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,720
then in another part of the website

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,519
potentially 30 THC it looks like a

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,019
contradiction it makes sense if you

323
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,959
realize we're talking about the seed

324
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,720
itself is THC free you've got to do the

325
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,719
work and create the THC like I said if

326
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,639
you are in a legal location

327
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
all right podcast world I feel like I've

328
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,819
caught up on the business part of the

329
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,799
show now it is time to segue into

330
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,899
everybody's favorite portion of the grow

331
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,599
from your heart podcast that of course

332
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,980
is the grow help question part of the

333
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,079
show I've got a bunch of great questions

334
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,899
here in front of me these questions come

335
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,399
from my website at iregenetics.com if

336
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,259
you go to my website there's a list of

337
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,539
tabs at the top one of them does say

338
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,980
questions or grow help if you click on

339
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,559
that tab you will be sent to a little

340
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,420
form that form has a few basic questions

341
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,939
like are you growing indoors are you

342
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,620
growing Outdoors if you go to the

343
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,660
website and you fill out that grow help

344
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,159
Tab and you send me a question and I

345
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,159

348
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,278
question on today's episode came from my

349
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,360
new friend Michael Michael it is great

350
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,399
to meet you thank you for the great

351
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,139
question Michael please do send me your

354
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,579
Michael's grow question goes just like

355
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,979
this it says hey Ross to Jeff how do we

356
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:58,559
know that the seeds we buy from you that

357
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,259
the parents do not have hop latent

358
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,239
viroid that is a very good question a

359
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,458
very hot topic I do have a very good

360
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,560
answer before I give you the solid short

361
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,899
concise answer let me ramble a little

362
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,239
bit and talk about hop latent viroid

363
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,539
many people may not know what this virus

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,759
or this viroid is recently this virus

365
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:19,219
has been plaguing Groves all over the

366
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,419
place I thought it was in California

367
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,160
recently I discovered that a friend with

368
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,979
a commercial cultivation in New Mexico

369
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,659
tested positive for this virus so it has

370
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,420
moved into New Mexico which means it is

371
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,159
probably all over the place Growers like

372
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,860
to send clones all over the place we

373
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,078
share clones we trade clones so this is

374
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,120
going to become a very dangerous problem

375
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,859
clones are going to get all over the

376
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,620
place this disease is going to be spread

377
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,659
very quickly so this is a virus this

378
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,860
virus makes our plants they look like

379
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,179
they're healthy they look like they're

380
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,159
fine then when you put them into flour

381
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,739
they kind of dud out they don't make big

382
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
buds they don't make big flowers

383
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,039
sometimes they show other symptoms but

384
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,839
the main sign of the hot plate and

385
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,639
viroid is that your plant that used to

386
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,560
put out three pounds per light now

387
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,180
barely puts out one pound per light it

388
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,619
doesn't grow worth of [ __ ] it's always

389
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,000
going to have problems it's always going

390
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,740
to look sad it's going to look droopy

391
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,200
it's going to look frustrated and you

392
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,060
can't figure out why that means you need

393
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,278
to test that plant for hoplate and

394
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,379
viroid it's a virus that came from the

395
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,240
Hops it transferred to the ganja plants

396
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,820
and knew we are spreading it all over

397
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,459
the place this virus can be spread by

398
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,720
plant saps and plant tissues so when

399
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,239
we're cutting clones or doing

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,100
defoliation or just topping plants when

401
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,720
you cut a plant you cut the plant with

402
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,300
the scissors the juice from that plant

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,160
the inside of that plant is now on your

404
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,659
scissors you go to cut another plant

405
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,939
guess what you just did you just

406
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,980
transferred that virus from one plant to

407
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,899
the other that quickly that easily

408
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,879
another way that the virus transfers

409
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,820
very easily and very quickly is through

410
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,919
water the virus can survive in water for

411
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,480
quite some time so what will happen is

412
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,278
we're going to cut a clone we're going

413
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,539
to put it in the easy cloner you're

414
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,338
going to cut another clone put it in

415
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,860
easy cleaner that water is going to stir

416
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,320
around now guess what every cut in your

417
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,839
easy cloner is now contaminated with hop

418
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,660
late and viroid so this virus is very

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,660
easy to spread the main problem is that

420
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:11,879
this virus is also nearly impossible to

421
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,860
eradicate the only way that we know of

422
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,838
to get rid of this virus so far is

423
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,300
through tissue culture and I only know

424
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,279
one person who has successfully removed

425
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:23,159
the virus from their plants through

426
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,899
tissue culture now with all of that fear

427
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,819
and hype being said it is completely

428
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,799
understandable that people who are

429
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,300
purchasing seeds should be very

430
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,979
concerned that the seeds they are

431
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,620
purchasing do not come from parent

432
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,360
plants that contain hoplate and viroid

433
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,698
I've been doing a little bit of reading

434
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,980
some scientists do say that the virus

435
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:43,019
will transfer into the seeds some people

436
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,579
say it will be in some of the seed some

437
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,320
people will say it will be in a lot of

438
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,958
the seed some people say it will not

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,060
pass to the seed at all I do not have

440
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,039
the credentials to have an opinion on

441
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,319
that I honestly don't have the education

442
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,958
the schooling I have have no business

443
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,600
even having an opinion on if that virus

444
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,119
will pass to the seed what I do know is

445
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,579
that I do not have any plants in my grow

446
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
that contain hoplate and viroid how can

447
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,599
I be sure of that because there are

448
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,300
multiple Labs across our country that do

449
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,459
test our plants for hoplate and viroid

450
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,198
the only way anybody can be sure that

451
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,958
their plants do not have hoplate and

452
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:22,198
viroid is to have them tested and I have

453
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,719
had every plant in my garden tested by

454
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,879
two of the major leading hoplate and

455
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,980
viroid testing facilities in the United

456
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,899
States in my opinion they're the two

457
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,420
most popular and two most reliable

458
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,339
testing facilities every plant in my

459
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,219
garden has been tested for hop late and

460
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,259
viroid every clone that comes in now is

461
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,000
tested for hoplate and viroid before it

462
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,459
is allowed to enter the general

463
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,679
population I've got a little area set up

464
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,479
a little quarantine area if you give me

465
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,519
a clone sell me a clone if I find a

466
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,220
clone if it falls out of the sky that

467
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,019
clone lands in my quarantine area I

468
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,579
immediately I've got back up to test on

469
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,659
hand I should have had one here at the

470
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,000
table but they're in my grow space

471
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,860
honestly I have tests every time I order

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
a test from I actually have been using

473
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,120
farmer Freeman farmer Freeman does not

474
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,740
pay me they do not sponsor me I buy my

475
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,659
testing kits just like a civilian I

476
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,640
order them online they come in the mail

477
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,100
I order extra so I've always got a

478
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,259
couple on hand anytime I get a new plant

479
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,058
that plant goes directly into my

480
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,220
quarantine area it's just a little tiny

481
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,019
area with a very small white but it's a

482
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,179
little isolation Booth so I can find out

483
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,740
if that plant's got problems before I

484
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,500
put it into general population and

485
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,298
infect my entire Garden I started doing

486
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,000
this watching for bugs but now we're

487
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:35,279
also watching for viruses so the plant

488
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,960
comes in and immediately I grab a

489
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,119
testing kit off the shelf I've got a few

490
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,519
extras on the Shelf I grab one up I

491
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,739
label it I date it there are three

492
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,599
envelopes in the testing kit you open up

493
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,400
an envelope you put a leaf in there you

494
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,019
open up a lot of all three envelopes get

495
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,538
a leaf from different parts of the plant

496
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,038
so they are different ages the virus

497
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,779
will move through different parts of the

498
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,000
plant at different speeds you could test

499
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,440
one branch and may not have any virus

500
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,619
you test another Branch it could be

501
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,558
fully loaded with viral load also I send

502
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:06,418
in a small piece of root Sample about a

503
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,279
two to three inch a little piece of

504
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,679
roots off of each plant that gets tested

505
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,660
that gets sent in with the leaf material

506
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,340
from what I understand and what I have

507
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,919
read many times you will get a negative

508
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,839
test on a leaf sample but the virus will

509
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,400
be present in The Roots as the main way

510
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,798
to determine if that plant's got the

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,140
virus so if you do choose to test make

512
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,200
sure you are doing a root sample test

513
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,360
when looking for hlv so basically that

514
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,860
is the short and long answer of how I

515
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,079
can assure you that none of the seeds

516
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,119
you are purchasing from me will contain

517
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,058
hoplate and viroid because I have lab

518
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,859
tests for every plant in my garden and

519
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,019
sometimes randomly so if I get a new

520
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,579
clone and I decide to test uh this clone

521
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,740
right here and I've got two or three

522
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:48,240
tests sitting around I'll test that one

523
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,220
but since I've got to pay for shipping

524
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,200
I'll grab another plant randomly in the

525
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,759
grow and grab leaves off of that and do

526
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
a test on that one also there's a

527
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,179
procedure to be done and I don't use the

528
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,740
same gloves don't use the same scalpel

529
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,360
everything is cleaned between testing

530
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,460
but what I'm getting at is if I'm

531
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,019
sending one test I just also send

532
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,600
another test it's like looking around

533
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,579
the grow room seeing who gets a UA today

534
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,740
so basically if I'm testing this new

535
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,599
plant why not grab another plant in the

536
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,460
garden and just give it a random test so

537
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,959
that we can just randomly test plants

538
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,940
and make sure that everything is clean

539
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,440
so if I'm testing a new plant I'll look

540
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,840
in the bedroom or the mom room and I'll

541
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,160
go that one today and I'll change gloves

542
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,079
and I'll clean everything up there is a

543
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,000
procedure to be done but I will test

544
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,319
another plant at the same time I've got

545
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
to pay for shipping I got to send them

546
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,918
off to Farmer Freeman so why not give

547
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,839
him two plants to test instead of just

548
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,820
one just a little bit of redundancy in

549
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,798
the testing to make sure there is no

550
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,599
virus I want to be responsible and make

551
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,000
sure that I am not spreading a virus to

552
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,558
any of the people buying my seeds so

553
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,079
that is how I am making sure to be extra

554
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,879
careful to not spread any viruses I am

555
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,918
having my plants tested as soon as they

556
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,140
come in and then I also randomly test

557
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,660
everything every few weeks everything

558
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,640
will get tested within six days eight

559
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,259
weeks every plant will have a test every

560
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,900
six to eight weeks I don't do everything

561
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,058
all at once uh that's expensive and it

562
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,160
seems like a lot of tests to go pool I

563
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,019
just do a couple every week or whenever

564
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,880
a new clone comes in that way I can just

565
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,980
kind of stay in the rotation and make

566
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,299
sure that everything is clean so that's

567
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,558
how I can assure you that none of the

568
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:16,259
seeds you're going to receive from me

569
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,298
have viruses because I am doing my due

570
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,940
diligence and I am testing every single

571
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,619
plant that comes into my garden also I

572
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
recently sprouted a bunch of seeds I'm

573
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,979
not sure how much I've talked about that

574
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,960
here on the podcast I sprouted a bunch

575
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,579
of seeds that I bread I sprouted a bunch

576
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,079
of seeds from other breeders and friends

577
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,819
they all look great they look

578
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,699
magnificent when they get a little bit

579
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,439
bigger I'm going to also randomly test a

580
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,019
few of those plants that came from seed

581
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,538
just for fun and also in the future

582
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,879
there will be a test to actually test a

583
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:46,679
batch of seeds for the presence of virus

584
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
the problem with that is the seeds have

585
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,100
to be destroyed so the way we would do

586
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,319
it is a few bread let's just say you

587
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,699
bread a thousand seeds you take 20 or 30

588
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,159
percent of them and actually donate

589
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,140
those for for testing purposes and then

590
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,820
if that virus shows up in any of those

591
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,559
we've got to test a lot more and we know

592
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:02,759
that it's in there if you don't see it

593
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,319
then we're going to have faith that if

594
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,240
it's not in 20 to 30 percent of the

595
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,918
seeds it should not be present it's come

596
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,319
from the tests have come from both

597
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,299
parents and the seeds eventually that is

598
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,159
almost triple redundancy so that my

599
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,099
friends is how you can rest assured that

600
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,000
you will not get any viruses from my c

601
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,099
line

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,720
so my new friend Michael we are testing

603
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,399
everything for hot plate and viroid and

604
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,500
in the future we will also be testing

605
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,419
the seeds that my friend is how you can

606
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,058
rest assured that none of the seeds you

607
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,400
buy from me will contain hop latent

608
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:34,259
viroid alright my buddy Michael once

609
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,600
again please do send me your address and

610
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:40,019
I will get you a pack of irie genetics

611
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,939
premium seeds in the mail as soon as

612
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,099
possible all right I've got another

613
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,500
great question in front of me this one

614
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,959
also came from the grow help tab on the

615
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,579
irie genetics website this one came from

616
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,100
our friend who wants to be called Mr

617
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,439
awesome badass what's up Mr awesome

618
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,418
badass it is good to meet you I probably

619
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,220
will not call you that if we do hang out

620
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,860
in person we're gonna have to adjust

621
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,380
that the question however goes a lot

622
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,359
like this it says yo Rasta Jeff I found

623
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,700
you after your appearance over at

624
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,199
cannabis that was a great interview yo

625
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,480
big shout out to my friends at cannabis

626
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,120
for having a great social media platform

627
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,740
and for doing amazing interviews every

628
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,599
single week one week they even did two

629
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,640
interviews you guys are killing it out

630
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,859
there shout out to all of my friends who

631
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,080
are on cannabis and the folks that run

632
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,058
cannabis let me keep moving it says I've

633
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,220
recently gotten into growing can of

634
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:30,779
bonsai as a hobby and I'm now on the

635
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,179
hunt for a strain that works well with

636
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,399
this type of growing yield and Terps are

637
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,259
not necessarily the goal with creating

638
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,480
these works of art so let me talk about

639
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:40,619
cannabanzai have you guys seen most of

640
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,120
the time a ganja plant will grow

641
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,918
straight up they'll kind of Branch out

642
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,899
have you seen the guys that are shaping

643
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,419
it the exact way that they want they're

644
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,600
doing Bonsai technique to their ganja

645
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,640
plant it is not commercially viable it's

646
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,798
not uh productive but if you want to

647
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,538
have a nice project and a nice Hobby and

648
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,119
have some good smoke for yourself at the

649
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,980
end this is a beautiful hobby a very Zen

650
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,899
experience so that is what a can of

651
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,700
bonsai is they're basically shaping the

652
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,380
plant manipulating the plant through

653
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,819
pruning maybe through tying it back

654
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,220
through pulling it down and holding it

655
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,980
down certain ways but they are bonsai

656
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,558
their ganja plan now let me keep going

657
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,720
it says yield and Terps are not

658
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,298
necessarily the goal in creating these

659
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,860
works of art that's understandable it

660
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:25,200
says my question is have you come across

661
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,959
a strain that not only can handle tiny

662
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,960
pots but also can handle crazy training

663
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,538
that these Bonsai girls will go through

664
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,340
something that stays pliable longer than

665
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,558
most yes I understand exactly what

666
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,480
you're asking for as some plants age

667
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,940
they do get Woody they start off really

668
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,460
green really pliable really flexible and

669
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,960
as they get older uh they get more Brown

670
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,058
I guess is the way to describe it and

671
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,860
they get drier they get snappier and

672
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,538
they don't bend as easily as they did

673
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,279
before that's just a trait of some

674
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:55,319
plants yes I do have some

675
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,319
recommendations that will work very well

676
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,418
for your Bonsai idea the first one I

677
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,038
want to recommend it may be kind of hard

678
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,980
to find because it was mainly given away

679
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:08,038
as a freebie but the Tangy Ripper will

680
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,140
do amazingly with this technique another

681
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,298
one that would work very well for you is

682
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,000
the sun kiss that also has that Platinum

683
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:16,918
Tangy female in there the Tangy Ripper

684
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,019
the platinum on the sun kiss have the

685
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,659
same mom also I'm going to recommend

686
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,220
orangegasm for this project if you

687
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,720
spread that orange Chasm out and shape

688
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,460
it into the Bonsai and then put it into

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,740
flour you're going to get giant Bonsai

690
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,659
buds it's going to stay nice and pliable

691
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,240
for you so you can work with it and it

692
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,520
won't go too crazy in that small pot so

693
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,620
I think all of the things that derive

694
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,599
from the Platinum Tangy will work very

695
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,219
well for this idea I would also

696
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,798
recommend bubble goat for this project

697
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,900
and bubble goat is readily available the

698
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,000
bubble goat and the orange gasm are both

699
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,380
readily available at many seed vendors

700
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,460
you should have no problem getting those

701
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,500
but the orange gasm the bubble goat what

702
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,819
was the other one Sun kiss and the Tangy

703
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,640
Ripper are the strains I would

704
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:02,879
definitely recommend for your Bonsai

705
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,220
project uh my friend Mr awesome badass

706
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,140
oh he wraps it up with uh thanks for

707
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,279
what you do I enjoy the show hey my

708
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,380
friend thank you for the great question

709
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,418
I'm glad I was able to guide you into

710
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,520
the right direction for bonsai plants

711
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,620
and also for you folks out there that

712
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,298
use a trellis or like to manipulate the

713
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:19,979
plants a lot all of those strains will

714
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:22,319
work great for the trellis and

715
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,298
manipulation as well all of the Platinum

716
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,639
Tangy crosses and most of the Golden

717
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:28,558
Goat crosses are going to handle bending

718
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,440
popping twisting snapping and

719
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,298
manipulation like this very well so my

720
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,980
