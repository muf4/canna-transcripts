00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,198
yeah welcome back cannabis Community

2
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,679
it's time for episode number 56 of the

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,840
grow from your heart podcast your source

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,800
for Cannabis News education and

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,439
conversation if you're a new grower if

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
you're a PR grower if you're a new

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,039
smoker or a veteran Dabber if you're a

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
cannabis activist or if you're just

9
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,119
someone who's curious about the current

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,759
state of cannabis this my friends is the

11
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,038
podcast for you I'm your host Rost Jeff

for coming we're excited about this uh

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,600
Sean is going to drop some knowledge on

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,238
you guys today that is going to [ __ ] up

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,000
your whole thought process on

25
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,118
growing yeah so uh I'm here to to give

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,200
out some information you can take it or

27
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,879
leave it I'm not turn just a little that

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,478
mic has uh impotency problems it likes

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:21,359
to droop after a while yeah so uh I'm

30
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:25,879
not my word is not law by any means but

31
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,200
uh this is just my how I grow this is uh

32
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:31,478
what I have discovered through my

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,320
personal uh studies but I just want to

34
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:40,200
say stop using molasses in your te's um

35
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,879
and yeah I mean completely and the main

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,040
reason is is a lot of people are using

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,560
molasses on a regular basis typically

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
when you ask somebody what they're using

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,439
in your compost tea and the same for me

40
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,438
um I think probably on the first episode

41
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,599
I probably even recommended certain

42
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,359
rates to use molasses at I think so and

43
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,640
uh you know so I mean you just this is

44
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,879
an evolved industry Everything Changes

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,879
we learn as we go but uh so I cut I

46
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,118
heard a while ago basically you need to

47
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,919
quit using somebody told me you need to

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,919
quit using molasses I said why they were

49
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,359
you know I'll get back to you and I

50
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,479
never heard from them again but it stuck

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,959
in my head so I quit using molasses just

52
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,598
cut it out and uh I didn't see a

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,759
difference you know what I mean it's not

54
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,238
like things quit working so it's not

55
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,359
acting like the bud hardener and the

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,719
sweetener like we think it is maybe yeah

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,519
you know I didn't I didn't see it so uh

58
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,318
I'm doing my thing and then I get back

59
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,000
in touch with this person and we kind of

60
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,679
discuss a little more

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,719
and you know a a lot of people like I

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,719
was saying for a basic compost tea what

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,560
I used to recommend and what a lot of

64
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,800
people are using are earthworm castings

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,360
or Alaskan humus or some sort of humic

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,120
acid they're using molasses and then

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,440
they're using like a kelp meal or

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,200
something well the reason that you use

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,959
that masses in the tea is actually not

70
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,439
for the reason that you had mentioned

71
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,158
earlier when you use Excuse me when you

72
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,280
use the molasses in a tea it's not for

73
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,120
not so much as a bud hardener for the

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,239
you know plant it's not so much a

75
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,400
carbohydrate for the plant as it is a

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,680
food source for the microbes in the tea

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,200
right in our te's okay and the thing

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
with molasses is it's a simple

79
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,839
carbohydrate and simple carbohydrates

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,959
feed simple organisms and that's the

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,280
simplest way to say it so molasses is an

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,319
extremely strong bacteria food uh you've

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,400
probably heard before that marijuana is

84
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,798
a fungal dominant plant they like fungal

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,080
dominant teas especially in flow okay uh

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,640
so by using molasses you're going to be

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,879
encouraging uh bacterial growth

88
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:57,279
well the Molasses not only feeds the

89
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,798
bacteria but it feeds it in an enormous

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,759
rate bacteria is naturally occurring

91
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,760
it's everywhere it's already in the soil

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,120
it's on our skin it's everywhere and in

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,798
between so it's already going to be

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,438
there in your tea it's going to be in

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,680
your water it's going to be in your soil

96
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,639
you know probably some of it's already

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,239
going to be in

98
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,719
molasses

99
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,040
so there's plenty of bacteria out there

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,560
as you add this molasses you start to

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,479
feed this bacteria and the bacteria

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,240
starts to eat the food and they start to

103
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:32,038
digest and what happens is the growth of

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,439
the bacteria happens too fast and the

105
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,879
organisms uh will actually use up all of

106
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,719
the available food and oxygen resources

107
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,839
so you actually drop the dissolved

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,919
oxygen levels in your tea so putting

109
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,519
molasses in your AAC te will take out

110
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,159
one of those A's it will make it go

111
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,959
anerobic and you will no longer be

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,439
having an air rated compost tea despite

113
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,839
you having bubblers running um you'll

114
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,918
still you're still going to take out the

115
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,000
oxygen you lower the dissolved oxygen

116
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,359
levels then you're just harvesting

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,079
anerobic bacteria basically killing off

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
everything we're working to create

119
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,918
exactly by adding the thing that we

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,000
thought was fueling our fire exactly by

121
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,240
adding molasses you're just taking out

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,199
everything that you just put all of your

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,918
money and time into you're just growing

124
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,639
the bacteria at a phenomenal rate

125
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,758
they're out competing everything else

126
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,280
and that's eventually what you put on

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
your plant I just Googled fungal

128
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,478
dominance um we can do an entire episode

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
on that just by what I'm reading yes you

130
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,120
guys are going to have to go if you want

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
to catch up Google fungal dominance I

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
can't even begin to explain it there is

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
so much going on in fungal dominance wow

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
that'll change your thinking but right

135
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,199
there yeah yeah definitely so uh with

136
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,079
the t's like I was saying it so when you

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,439
add the Molasses it can drop the

138
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,318
dissolved oxygen levels for anybody

139
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,680
who's listening who wants to know

140
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,479
specifically above eight parts per

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,918
million of dissolved oxygen is where you

142
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,639
want your teas that's when you're

143
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,478
Brewing aerobic organisms between

144
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,840
between six parts per million and E

145
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,399
parts per million you are facilitating

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,318
anerobic zones these organisms out

147
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,598
compete the aerobic organisms at a rate

148
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,120
of 2 to one these facilitate anerobic

149
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:17,159
zones uh this is where some really nasty

150
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,399
things live uh these things are in your

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,759
compost you are if like these bad

152
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,079
organisms are in your compost such as

153
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,919
you know really anerobic or eoli or

154
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,680
these other things just

155
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,279
nasties uh they're going to multiply at

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,598
an alarming rate once you start you know

157
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,119
creating this anerobic environment and

158
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,120
if you use that as a foler spray You'

159
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,160
just sprayed eoli under your plants

160
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,959
right yeah and that's the thing is they

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
actually like when you your tee starts

162
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,279
to do that the organisms that produce

163
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,839
acids that kill Anor robic organisms and

164
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,359
high enough qualities these acids can

165
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,318
stress and kill your

166
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
plant you know in no growing environment

167
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,879
anywhere is there a shortage of

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,360
bacteria so uh there's no need to just

169
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,720
feed more of them and stress your plants

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,560
out and uh there's other options instead

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,560
of molasses so right off the bat just

172
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,959
cut it out so if you want to do a te

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,639
what I would recommend would be uh

174
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,758
actually here one second but yeah so if

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,759
you're going to start a te uh I would

176
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,360
just go with worm

177
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,520
castings I would go with

178
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,479
uh Kel

179
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,318
meal and that's just about about it

180
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,959
castings and Kel meal yeah I'm sorry I'm

181
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
trying to I've got everything right now

182
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,918
so yeah there you go he's got a he's got

183
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,598
a whole computer in front of him me guys

184
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:39,799
so yeah I I tried to come prepared he

185
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,240
came well prepared I kind of peaked at

186
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,879
his notes a minute ago he's got a lot of

187
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,000
info yeah so we've got uh so basically

188
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,800
for for a really basic compost tea I'm

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,399
going to roll with Dr Elaine Ingram's

190
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,478
compost tea so her te's are basically

191
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,959
compost or you know worm castings or

192
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,758
whatever you can

193
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:03,598
Source uh Kel meal and then

194
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,879
you can add in uh instead of molasses

195
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,439
you can add in a humic source so you can

196
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,360
add in like a humic acid derived from

197
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,038
Pete like a dragonfly Earth medicine's

198
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,639
brilliant black uh there's a lot what I

199
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,598
would recommend actually yeah there's a

200
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,840
lot of different options out there but

201
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:21,279
you can add in a humic acid or or in

202
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,038
that place you could add in a fish Hydro

203
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:28,000
slate so for your base teas every time I

204
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,719
would just go with worm castings and

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,158
water outside that you can add in kelp

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,320
meal or alphalpha meal or anything like

207
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,559
that specific to your stage uh your

208
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,599
plant stage in life and then if you want

209
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,038
to start adding foods for the fungi

210
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,920
basically if you're in veg fish Hydro

211
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,319
slate so for vegetative growth instead

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,159
of using molasses replace it with fish

213
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,040
Hydro slate now fish Hydro slate it can

214
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,480
it can go the same way as massis it can

215
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,719
turn your tea anerobic really fast and I

216
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,519
know you're probably thinking anerobic

217
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,040
well you know you I personally talk

218
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,519
about anerobic te's and bkash and all of

219
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,639
these things which is you know they're

220
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,200
actually anob fermentations and anic

221
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,278
anerobic compost that's completely

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,480
different that's because we want

223
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:19,000
anerobic environments we don't want

224
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:22,039
anerobic bacteria in our aerobic teas

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
okay you know so they're separate but

226
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,000
equal you know yeah we're making a tea

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,078
and feeding that to our exactly you

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,360
don't yeah you know so when you're

229
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,799
fermenting don't let o get into it and

230
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,320
when you're ating Don't Let It Go

231
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:39,719
stagnant you know down

232
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,040
rubic so as far as uh food for your teas

233
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,560
uh like I was saying if you need to

234
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,919
improve your fungal count uh which

235
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,479
everybody wants to everybody wants

236
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,360
fungal dominant teas you can add uh

237
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,480
steel cut oat brand or steel cut oats uh

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,360
brand prowder shrimp shells I mean

239
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,000
there's any sort of uh really any sort

240
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,159
of like high protein and we can just

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,440
pick that up at the health food store

242
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,838
right you can pick all of that up at the

243
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,959
health food store actually there's a lot

244
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,600
of like uh I've seen a lot of stuff on

245
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:12,199
people or people are starting to consume

246
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,839
like fish hydr slate and stuff which I

247
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,120
don't know if I'm there yet but uh I

248
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,360
mean I wouldn't be surprised if you can

249
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,278
pick that up at the health food store

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,839
soon eventually

251
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:28,200
right but uh yeah so you're just

252
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,920
molasses I mean take it how you want it

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,720
you know take it or leave it

254
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,838
I recommend cutting it out I think uh

255
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,399
I've learned from very reable sources

256
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,519
and you know they're these aren't people

257
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
just you know

258
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,120
talking you know [ __ ] these are real

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,320
scientists these guys are sitting there

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
in front of their microscopes and

261
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,680
they're straining their minds and their

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,039
eyes so we don't have to no I don't

263
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,519
think you need to uh try to give

264
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,919
yourself any sort of credit or your

265
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,480
sources you've been on here enough and I

266
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,639
think people have realized that you are

267
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,079
definitely not full of [ __ ] think you've

268
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,879
earned your credit here I'm going to

269
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,599
give it to you well thank you we respect

270
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,799
your opinion I respect your opinion well

271
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,360
thank you I've been at this for years

272
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,278
and you teach me stuff every time you

273
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,639
come well I really appreciate it and uh

274
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,759
but yeah so I mean just cut the cut the

275
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,320
molasses out of your te's I used to use

276
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,480
it every [ __ ] day I

277
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,120
mean my last batch of tea and you know

278
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,278
what I didn't see much of a difference

279
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,440
uh I used I used used to use your

280
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,600
recommendation or the rev's

281
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,160
recommendation of molasses in my tea and

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,200
I made a tea just a few days ago with

283
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,919
some uh Bash bucket leech in there and I

284
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,160
actually got way more foam without the

285
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,958
Molasses on that bucket than I've ever

286
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,838
made that's the best I've ever made was

287
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,919
my most reent without the Molasses yeah

288
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,519
I mean and the plants loved it you're

289
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,319
going to get way better results using uh

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,879
beneficial microorganisms using things

291
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,480
like a cold processed fish Hydro slate

292
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,439
like the Browns fish Hydro slate you

293
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,879
grab from Rocky Mount worm company uh or

294
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,160
you can make your own fish Hydro slate

295
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,240
but uh those food sources work way

296
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,958
better they're way more natural natur um

297
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,360
it's just like us if we eat natural food

298
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,679
our body absorbs it much more naturally

299
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,278
instead of trying to go to McDonald's or

300
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,759
whatever exctly pull out the nutrients

301
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,200
and poop out the crap instead you're

302
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,639
able to absorb what you're eating it's

303
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,199
like should be it's like eating a

304
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,759
Pop-Tart or an apple yeah I mean it's

305
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:22,240
you know how does your body run off of

306
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:25,759
it but uh yeah the so for teas just keep

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,278
it simpler the better you know just run

308
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,720
your castings run you know your kelp if

309
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,078
you want to add a food source you can I

310
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,959
like I really like fish Hydra slate

311
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,078
during veg you see tremendous vegetative

312
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,439
growth and then that's how you really

313
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,838
step away from bottled nutrients you

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,519
know that way if you are using bottled

315
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,440
nutrients the only one you're using is

316
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,720
the fish product uh what are we using

317
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,920
sorry to cut you off what are we using

318
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,519
to feed the tea uh In Bloom you keep

319
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,759
saying fish hydros slate and V okay so

320
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,639
for if you're going to feed your tea and

321
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:00,519
Bloom uh uh soft rock phosphate there we

322
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,680
go yeah uh that's a lot of your ogt so

323
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,919
sofro phosphate but that goes right back

324
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,439
into you need to know what you're using

325
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,639
how much you're using where you're

326
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,199
sourcing it from if you go and you dump

327
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,360
astronomical amount of softrock

328
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,159
phosphate on your plant you're going to

329
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,278
you know like I said that goes right

330
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,319
back to you can be organic and you can

331
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,439
be worse than all your synthetic buddies

332
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,560
out there right I actually uh I think I

333
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
overused some ogt because I wasn't I was

334
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,359
thinking oh it's ogt let's [ __ ] it up so

335
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,719
I fed it instead of every two weeks I

336
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,680
was doing it every week because I wasn't

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,480
paying attention ention and I think the

338
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,599
plants sped up too much like you said

339
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,039
cuz they were burn they were showing

340
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,639
nitrogen deficiencies in like week five

341
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,559
and I think they're just going too fast

342
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,399
that's more from like the the trod Derma

343
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,879
like strains that they have in there but

344
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,480
he has soft rock phosphate also in there

345
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,720
which works as a food for the microbes

346
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,560
and it's a fungal food but you can also

347
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,920
get your phosphates obviously from

348
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,479
introducing that into the tea so it's a

349
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,639
great that's a great source of uh if you

350
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,839
need a bloom tea for SE theoretically

351
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,759
you should have all of that am minuted

352
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,680
in your soil um and it'll just kind of

353
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,240
take up what it wants um which kind of

354
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,278
rolls into what we were originally that

355
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,639
was our um our original idea today was

356
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,278
to talk about building a little bit of

357
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,000
soil so I believe you I like your guys

358
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,720
the Molasses is unnecessary those are

359
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,198
old school farmer tricks we were taught

360
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,440
that uh try it yourself make a do a test

361
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,838
run set one set of plants on one side of

362
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,199
the room one set on the other add

363
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,399
molasses to one set of tea or however

364
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,519
you're feeding add M don't add molasses

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
to the other see the difference for

366
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,839
yourself it's uh you're not going to see

367
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,198
enough difference to like break the bank

368
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,959
or anything so give it a try yeah and I

369
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,599
mean keep your molasses around I use it

370
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,599
for plenty of stuff uh

371
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,369
[Music]

372
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,198
fpjsangprobinsyano but don't use it for

373
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,039
the teas food source and don't use it

374
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,159
every time don't use it for your teas

375
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,519
food source guys we're over we're like

376
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,078
over amping the tea basically we're

377
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,240
making hyper little tea yeah it's all

378
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
back into little kids just like sugar

379
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,720
yeah they're out competing everybody

380
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,559
yeah all right so yeah for soil mixes uh

381
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,639
I really didn't even know where to start

382
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,039
for this one I know that everybody has

383
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,480
their own mix

384
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,639
everybody has their way of doing things

385
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,800
there's super soils and there's

386
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,480
layers and there's no till there's a

387
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,078
million ways to do everything so I just

388
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,680
I figured maybe the best way to go about

389
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,159
it would be to kind of just discuss uh

390
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,638
you know what what they are so uh okay

391
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,838
that sounds great perect so um a super

392
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:54,039
soil uh super soils are a term for a

393
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:57,680
nutrient charged soil uh subcool is the

394
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:01,958
father of super soils yeah subol made it

395
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,799
really famous and basically the idea is

396
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,039
you're going to create this nutrient

397
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,639
Rich mixture of soil and you're going to

398
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,719
layer the bottom of your pot with it and

399
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,198
then you're going to plant your plant

400
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,160
actually into a uh less hot medium like

401
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,639
so you would use a bag soil you so you

402
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,799
would take your five gallon container

403
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,360
and you'd fill the bottom so many inches

404
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,559
up with your super soil mix and then add

405
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
in your bag soil and then actually

406
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,518
transplant your plant into it

407
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,399
theoretically you water water your plant

408
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,560
The Roots grow through the bag soil

409
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,639
medium into the subra soil okay and then

410
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,399
you never have to fertilize your plant

411
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,799
you can just always feed up water you

412
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,159
know every time everything's already

413
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,278
mixed everything's already mixed in with

414
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:51,439
the soil um so that's one method of uh

415
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,919
mixing uh another method

416
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,759
for a lot of people is uh just like a

417
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:01,039
complete through and through mix so like

418
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,439
a dragon fire earth medicine just does a

419
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,720
really really awesome mix where they do

420
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,120
it's similar to the super soil but it's

421
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,519
actually Incorporated throughout the

422
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,359
entire mix so you don't like stir the

423
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,519
whole thing exactly so there is no like

424
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,479
layering and you don't pat it with you

425
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,240
know other soil what they'll do is they

426
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,519
they make their soil and then they do

427
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,400
what's a term called cooking which is

428
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,038
just composting so they let their soil

429
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,480
sit for a couple of weeks or a month you

430
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,960
know the longer the better and by doing

431
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,679
that you can really encourage natural

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
processes and if you go to dragonfly

433
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,000
Earth medicine feed they've got some

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,558
really cool things about how they'll you

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,558
know you know the soil that's cooking

436
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,399
they'll treat with bkash and lactic acid

437
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,200
bacteria and they pour all their excess

438
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,000
compost teas on it and you can do these

439
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,679
things too while your soil Cooks but uh

440
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,159
they do a like really it's more of a

441
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,880
Botanical mixture uh um they use like a

442
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,440
kelp meal Alfalfa nettle um you can go

443
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,960
to their websit so their Feats and kind

444
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,159
of find out I don't want to give away

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,440
all there yeah go check them but they've

446
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:05,799
got some check out dragonfly Earth

447
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,480
medicine we'll get them on the show one

448
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,480
day uh they're in Canada they said they

449
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,319
were going to come here and then they

450
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,038
had to go back to Canada or Washington

451
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,200
they're right by Canada so they had to

452
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,879
skip out on the show the Pacific

453
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
Northwest they're just holding it down

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,760
up there actually they're in uh Europe

455
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,240
right now or yeah they went to like

456
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,640
Prague or they went all over the IST

457
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,679
they're going everywhere guys when they

458
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
come back they're going to do an

459
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,880
interview with me and they're going to

460
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,798
tell me about all the things they've

461
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,360
seen around the world so that'll be

462
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,440
great yeah but they've been prot uh

463
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,079
perfecting the soil mix for a while and

464
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,679
you know I mentioned them cuz they do

465
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,240
like a completely Botanical base you

466
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,320
know everything's plant-based with their

467
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,359
mixes I know a lot of other people are

468
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:47,000
traditionally doing especially like with

469
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,918
uh the Rev and some other people

470
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
moonshine man and there's a lot of other

471
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,799
mixes out there which are all uh bone

472
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,279
meal blood meal phosphates it's real

473
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,000
similar to subcools mix but but it's the

474
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,839
same idea that you mix it throughout the

475
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,960
whole batch and you let it cook for a

476
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:06,199
period of time and then you grow into it

477
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,679
and we got to get away from the blood

478
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,919
meal and the bone meal feather meal yeah

479
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,080
there's Alternatives I mean you know

480
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,559
bone

481
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,879
meal soft rock phosphate C free nettle

482
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:21,879
Yaro fishbone meal there's other options

483
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,640
blood meal uh which is your nitrogen

484
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Source uh yeah there's I don't even need

485
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,720
to like get into there's so many other

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
nitrogens alfalfa

487
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,799
yeah there's there's so many other

488
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,678
nitrogen sources I don't even need to

489
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,319
cover that but uh I mean you definitely

490
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,840
Source where your products are coming

491
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:45,839
from uh me personally uh I go with a

492
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:49,798
very simple mix uh I

493
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,839
use typically I like to mix my own soil

494
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:57,079
base uh the best mixture I've ever used

495
00:19:52,839 --> 00:20:01,558
personally was um it's a product called

496
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:04,839
Malibu compost it's a biodynamic compost

497
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,960
blend uh it's [ __ ] awesome it's only

498
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,678
available in California it's really hard

499
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,480
to get here I was fortunate enough to

500
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,759
come across a couple of bags and uh it

501
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,880
was probably some of the best product

502
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,640
they use but it's a compost it's not a

503
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
soil mix who's in California that can

504
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,960
send us a couple of bags of that

505
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,799
somebody hook me up please yeah we need

506
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,480
that Malibu compost I'll give you my PO

507
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,240
box number just hook me up yeah but it's

508
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,839
a biodynamic blend so they have like

509
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Yaro and nettle and Dand lines and all

510
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:34,279
sorts of cool stuff mixed in there but

511
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,440
uh so I used uh so I used a compost and

512
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,359
then cut it in with peite I'm I'm sorry

513
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,519
not pear I use a compost and then I cut

514
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,158
it in with worm castings uh so I make my

515
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:49,240
own like Verma compost so I'll use the

516
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,720
yeah the Malibu compost Rocky Mount worm

517
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,720
castings and then I'll add in an airator

518
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,360
which is typically a lot of people use

519
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,679
perlite I don't like perlite so much so

520
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:05,678
I use uh diatomite because I've got a

521
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,280
huge bag of it I've had for like years

522
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm still working through it but you can

523
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,678
use like pumis or lava rock I like to

524
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,519
recommend people use things that don't

525
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,759
go away as fast you know uh Pearl like

526
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,839
floats to the top and it grinds up

527
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,079
really fine and it just kind of goes

528
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:26,199
away to nothing but uh I always

529
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,720
recommend people to do like a 50% like

530
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,400
lava rock or pumis or diamite something

531
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,480
that doesn't break down as quick and

532
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,200
then do another 50 like the other half

533
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,839
do like a rice hole or buckwheat hole

534
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,600
okay or some you know more of a carbon

535
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,839
based airator all right uh so yeah we

536
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,359
put in our airator and then after your

537
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,519
compost and your airator then you make

538
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,278
the decision of whether or not you're

539
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:52,440
going to want to use cocoa core or Pete

540
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:55,599
Moss I like Pete Moss but I like the

541
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,759
environment too and so you kind of got

542
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,399
to that all comes from like one swamp in

543
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,038
Canada or something you know so you got

544
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,679
it like I said Organics it seems like

545
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:04,960
it's always awesome but it's not always

546
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,400
the best you just kind of got to pick

547
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,600
what you want I've actually found best

548
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,480
result I like a mixture of cocoa and pea

549
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,918
Moss there's something about the oils

550
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,759
that come from the cocoa fiber that the

551
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,360
plant really likes yeah I I've really

552
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,558
like a mix of uh I've been playing

553
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,719
around take a dab so you better keep

554
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,359
talking no you're good yeah I've been

555
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:30,038
playing around with different ratios uh

556
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:31,959
5050 75 25 uh of cocoa Pete Moss but I

557
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,480
kind of like a half and half mixture

558
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,159
with it and then uh outside of that

559
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,240
we'll go in and then add a Kel meal

560
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,559
crustation NE oyer shell powder glacio

561
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,038
raaus

562
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,918
gemson uh if we really want to get into

563
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,519
it we'll add you know biochar and bkash

564
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,960
and a lot of other natural farming

565
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:54,079
inputs but that's personally for like my

566
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,038
hom grow I can get a into it with that

567
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,720
stuff but you guys can too uh listen to

568
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,200
this episode hit pause and Rewind all

569
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,839
that stuff and listen back and make a

570
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
list and if you can't afford to buy a

571
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,720
bunch of [ __ ] buy the first two yeah and

572
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,599
then next time buy the buy three of them

573
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,278
and then you'll make a better soil every

574
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,959
every time and we'll start you'll start

575
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:12,880
seeing good you should get great results

576
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,759
right off the B if you if you think if

577
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
you if you play it back and you think

578
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,200
it's too overwhelming I tell you what I

579
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,159
I do work with the dispensaries a lot

580
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,840
you know I I I run a consultation

581
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,679
company so if any of you guys out there

582
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:28,000
know anybody who I hate the word I hate

583
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,559
saying I'm going do consultations but uh

584
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,400
if anybody out there wants to switch you

585
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,038
know any facilities that want to switch

586
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,519
we're all licensed over here at natural

587
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,359
farming and you know we've got our cards

588
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,918
we can go in and help your favorite grow

589
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,158
convert to Organics but I work with a

590
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,960
couple of different shops and they

591
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,840
always seem a little overwhelmed when I

592
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,759
come in there and I started running my

593
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,558
mouth about mixing soils and you're

594
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,640
going to get this and this and this and

595
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,158
you're going to mix it together and it's

596
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,960
overwhelming they like the when you can

597
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,080
walk in there and you can be like yep

598
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,840
buy a pallet of this and I want a pallet

599
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,480
of that so uh I've actually got a

600
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,918
mixture for everybody out there who

601
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,759
wants to go and just buy a pallet of

602
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,600
soil or you want to go buy B of promix

603
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,558
or some sunshine for so just go and grab

604
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,199
your uh Sunshine for your

605
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:17,119
promix I recommend cutting in worm

606
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,600
castings 10% for your microbial

607
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,918
Source uh then I would just add and

608
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,639
depending on what you're going with so

609
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
if you go with like a sunshine for

610
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,559
advanced they've got like a nutrient

611
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,439
starter pack which is I think a there's

612
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,200
some like minerals in there other things

613
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,159
like that yeah and uh that one's a

614
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,319
really good one to go with and then just

615
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:43,080
add in your worm castings kelp

616
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:44,678
meal neem uh neem cake and crustation M

617
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,798
or oyster shell powder just kind of

618
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,559
dependent on how you want to grow

619
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,119
personally okay but that's it that's

620
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,240
that's a good start right there and uh

621
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,278
I've I've tried them out like right now

622
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,880
if you go to the kingor cola feed on

623
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,880
Instagram you can look at the uh

624
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,480
there's pictures of worms just all over

625
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,440
the containers you know top soils moving

626
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,599
and that's actually all done in sunshine

627
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,640
4 with kelp neem crustation and oyster

628
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,158
shell powder nice uh really simple I me

629
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
I feel like I'm getting some of the best

630
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,240
results that I've ever had with this

631
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,038
super the between this mix and then the

632
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,720
mix I mentioned earlier with Malibu

633
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,960
compost are probably the two best

634
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,919
results I've gotten since I've started

635
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,079
okay um you know it's so Hard To Source

636
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,520
a solid like place to get compost so if

637
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,599
you can't do that and you can't make

638
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,119
your own

639
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,599
compost I mean there's no shame in going

640
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,119
and buying a bag of soil you know what I

641
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,918
mean like everybody I don't know I I you

642
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,959
can always start a Bashi bucket that's a

643
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,520
great way to make some over the past

644
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,880
three or four weeks I don't know how

645
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,240
long I've been talking about the bokashi

646
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,120
bucket but I see it turning into Funk

647
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,679
inside that bucket and I will have

648
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,479
that's a five gallon bucket essentially

649
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,798
I'll have five gallons of compost to add

650
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,599
to a whole bunch of dirt and then in a

651
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,519
month or two I will have my own amazing

652
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,480
compost pile started from that exactly

653
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:13,440
and I mean even like even buying soil

654
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,038
from the store using the nicest castings

655
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,120
that money can buy like a rocky M worm

656
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:22,398
castings and uh it's still crazy and

657
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,158
then after amending the St soil it's

658
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:25,879
amazing how cheap this stuff comes out

659
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,360
I'm not going to say the name of this

660
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,000
like shop that I'm working for but I

661
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:35,158
will say that they're running 48820

662
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,839
gallons and we priced them out at a120

663
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,440
per gallon of soil wow that's amazing so

664
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,639
suck on that one

665
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,080
synthetics there you go guys and that's

666
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,278
for a dispensaries so they have to rely

667
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,480

775

776
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,439
stuff like it'll be the grow from your

777
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,440
heart uh Rocky Mountain worm castings

778
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,399

779
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,519
bonus section and just go right there

780
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,518
there'll be some gr Kashi there same

781
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,159
thing up at the shop for you too that'd

782
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,038
be so awesome let's do this guys that's

783
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,799
my proposal to you guys I'd appreciate

784
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,240
it so go if you can't if you can't

785
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,918
Source compost and all of that jazz then

786
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,359
go to your local Hydro Store hydro and

787
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,278
uh grab you a bag soil get you some

788
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:43,398
basic amendments and the the trick is is

789
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:46,038
to figure out what works for you um I

790
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:49,119
don't like this like one size fits-all

791
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,839
idea of growing um because it doesn't

792
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,918
you know me and you probably water

793
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,359
completely differently I bet I bet

794
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,320
completely differently if I used your

795
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,558
soil mixing methods I would probably

796
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:02,519
Slaughter those plants I guarantee I'd

797
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,440
kill every single one of them um and

798
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:05,960
then you do the same thing in my style

799
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,080
does that mean that you're a better

800
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,798
grower than me or vice versa no it

801
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,439
doesn't exactly it's just a matter of

802
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:13,759
you've got to dial it in you know I

803
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,360
would recommend starting out with a

804
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,359
promix or a sunshine 4 uh once you get a

805
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,240
grow or two down with that and your

806
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,278
really basic soil amendments then all

807
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,000
Sunshine 4 and promix is is Pete Moss

808
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,200
and an airator and you know so Source

809
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,679
those products what my last run was done

810
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,960
in with Sunshine 4 promix yeah and you

811
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,360
know so yeah I think people get

812
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,919
overwhelmed when you start talking about

813
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,038
the conversion to Organics but if they

814
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,799
only knew how close they already were

815
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,599
you know so many synthetic Growers are

816
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,879
using Sunshine for and they're using

817
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,879
promix it's like well next time you do

818
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,720
that just add in a microbial Source like

819
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,559
earthworm castings add in some kelp meal

820
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,480
you know to help prevent against you

821
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,720
know fungus Nats and WF flies and spider

822
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,519
mites add in some neem cake or

823
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,880
crustation meal

824
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,440
uh yeah I mean easy stuff like that

825
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,278
right you're mixing soil anyway you

826
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,440
should be you shouldn't I don't think

827
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,679
you should open the bag and just start

828
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,480
pulling out of the bag you should dump

829
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,080
it into something kind of spread it out

830
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,960
like I was surprised to learn that

831
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,038
synthe like I said I've always grown

832
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,960
organically so I was I see a lot of the

833
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,638
commercial synthetic Growers and kind of

834
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,240
how they're doing stuff and I was really

835
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,199
surprised to see even they in the [ __ ]

836
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,720
out of their soil I mean they're growing

837
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,080
you know in promix synthetically they

838
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,880
and they're still running

839
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,199
and uh yeah I mean that was something we

840
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,639
were trying to talk to a friend about

841
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,960
last night is finding that balance

842
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,439
between the worm castings and the

843
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,798
advanced nutrients he's like can I do

844
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,440
this and we're trying to tell him gently

845
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,278
that H your Advanced is just going to

846
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,798
kill all that stuff bro throw away those

847
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:47,319
Advanced bottles yeah you know I if you

848
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,798
want to make the if you want to make the

849
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,398
switch then you need to not get Advanced

850
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,679
Nutrients go get something like a

851
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:57,038
general Organics or Roots Organics or

852
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,759
biob Biz or and even botanic air is not

853
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,359
as organic as they try to advertise far

854
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,038
from it yeah I mean even if you were to

855
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,240
go age old is a really old school

856
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:11,038
product so cheap and I know so many

857
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,759
people who crush it with age old I've

858
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,000
got a friend who grows nothing but iy

859
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,558
genetics with nothing but age-old and

860
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,839
it's so cheap I mean you want to talk

861
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,918
about low cost of production who cares

862
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,678
if I mean you know you'll yield good but

863
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,759
even if you didn't it's so [ __ ] cheap

864
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,600
you're only paying for power right yeah

865
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:28,919
that's that's the truth yeah that's the

866
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,480
beauty of Organics Organics I'm making

867
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,639
the switch and I love it I've really

868
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,120
seen a difference in my plants uh they

869
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:36,479
perform better they don't seem and I

870
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,839
dude I've been growing cannabis for a

871
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,278
long time and the plants always seemed

872
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:40,678
like they were thriving to me and now

873
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,798
that I'm using the Organics I can see

874
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,840
that I was missing something they look

875
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,679
they just look they're waxier they don't

876
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,720
have they have more uh the cuticles on

877
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,159
the leaves are thicker uh the stems are

878
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,798
more robust and I was feeding I've fed

879
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,320
all the commercial brands of nutrients

880
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,960
before and I'm definitely noticing a

881
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,678
difference with just basic and just

882
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,519
small jumps to Organics it's not even

883
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,480
anything major well then you tell me you

884
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,079
since you come from uh the synthetic

885
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,320
world is it easier I hear a lot of

886
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,598
people tell me it's more complicated but

887
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,079
I am not the most I mean I do a lot of

888
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,399
other stuff you know what I mean I'm I'm

889
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,399
not in my grow like I used to be and my

890
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:22,199
my plants are fine the way I think this

891
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,358
seems to make more sense to me than

892
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,078
mixing up bottles like a scientist and

893
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,878
I've read all of my bottles anyway so I

894
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
know what that's coming from like I know

895
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,199
that that's chicken [ __ ] and seabird

896
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,918
guano why don't I just use chicken [ __ ]

897
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,480
and seabird guano yeah like and I think

898
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,239
I didn't trust myself to make those

899
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,039
mixtures I thought I'd burn something or

900
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,638
whatever but there are so many guides

901
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,320
between you the Rev and every Forum on

902
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,960
the internet I can find the correct

903
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,079
mixture for everything the podcast now

904
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,079
this is a good reference your plants are

905
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,800
going to be way more forgiving to you

906
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,679
putting the guano on it than to you

907
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,039
putting a bottled nutrient that's got

908
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,280
guano in it on it yeah true very true

909
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,759
that's more concentrated and I can

910
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
definitely add too much of that way

911
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,040
easily exactly I don't even like using

912
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,280
guano I'm going to stay away from any

913
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,599
kind of [ __ ] in my PLS guano is actually

914
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,040
extremely unsustainable to harvest um

915
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,640
and then it's really bad for you to

916
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:15,320
breathe in but I know a lot of people

917
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:17,719
are die hard about it and uh personally

918
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,720
I think it like produces some really

919
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:23,118
awesome outdoor um Jesse will swear by

920
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,199
it for the outdoor Growers Jesse would

921
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,960
come chop us down right now for saying

922
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,199
bad things about his Jama gu yeah the

923
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,000
the Guana is pretty banging for outdoor

924
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,199
um not you know there's other options

925
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,559
but hey right to each his own and if

926
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,319
we're dissing your growing methods I'm

927
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,719
sorry we're not dissing it we are just

928
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,559
uh trying to encourage you to do more

929
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,598
sustainable healthier things do what you

930

want do what you want you're going to

931

lifestyle that I try to live by and I

936
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,000
incorporate that all the way into the

937
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,838
medicine and the plants that I grow so

938

00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,679

971
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,279
some [ __ ] we're not going to know I've

972
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,960
never seen that so I don't know give me

973
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,960
three days to research it we'll find out

974
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,318
but right now you might have to call Jim

975
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,318
forer yeah but I feel like people have

976
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,519
this can like I don't know they've got

977
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,400
this idea that we can just like look at

978
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,199
one picture on your phone or you're

979
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,039
going to send me one direct message and

980
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,679
I'm going to know what you fed him for

981
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,279
the past three weeks and we'll try yeah

982
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,598
we'll try but sometimes yeah that one

983
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,880
last night was a weird challenge I don't

984
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,160
know what it was it was powdery

985
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,680
something milish looking stuff

986
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,598
unfortunately that was a case of uh all

987
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,239
too it's all too familiar like I know

988
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,519
him personally I was actually working

989
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,799
with him on that before the meeting he

990
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,039
was introduced to me through a friend of

991
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
mine but uh yeah I thought it was

992
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,039
powdering Milo originally and then we

993
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,240
thought it was a pH problem and we

994
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,079
thought it was new lock and it it all

995
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,759
too familiar of a problem he actually

996
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,200
you know wasn't too familiar with

997
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,000
growing uh went to the local Hydro Store

998
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,318
not Hydro because if he you know if

999
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,960
Jesse would have helped him the guy

1000
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:07,119
would have been killing it but he goes

1001
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,318
to these horrible competitors here in

1002
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,760
town and they set him up on what he

1003
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:15,199
thinks is Coco uh they give him a Coco

1004
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:19,480
nutrient uh he's running it turns out

1005
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,639
it's Pete Moss oh man and you know so it

1006
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,719
happens and and he's embarrassed and

1007
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:25,239
it's not his fault no should happen

1008
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,000
don't be embarrassed the guy awesome and

1009
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:30,039
he's learned so much and he's plants are

1010
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,318
still alive even after all of that you

1011
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,519
know like I mean his we saw [ __ ] up

1012
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:35,199
pictures of them but hey they're still

1013
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,239
kicking you I mean if he makes it to

1014
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,799
harvest that's what counts you know but

1015
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:42,239
uh perseverance you know you just got to

1016
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,079
keep stay committed to it don't if you

1017
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,639
think that I grow beautiful plants every

1018
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,960
time you're out of your mind oh man I

1019
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,679
just don't picture I just don't put

1020
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
pictures of the ugly ones on Instagram

1021
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:52,000
there's plenty of ugly [ __ ] that I've

1022
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,039
done I'll admit it one time I had and

1023
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,599
this was years ago the first time it was

1024
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,880
the first time I said I was in a new

1025
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,119
house growing in a brand new B basement

1026
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,838
in the middle of winter and I'd never

1027
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,519
grown in there before and you got to

1028
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,159
dial in a room but I had a white rhino

1029
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,239
plant in a 7even gon pot that probably

1030
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,759
weighed between 5 and 6 o and I went to

1031
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,959
cut it down and I noticed powdery mildew

1032
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,280
all up the one side that was near the

1033
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,599
exterior wall corner so that wall was

1034
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,240
colder than the whole rest of the room

1035
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,680
and it got powdery mildew uh it was ugly

1036
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,598
as [ __ ] my buddy Mike was there helping

1037
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,480
me trim and I said hey Mike watch this

1038
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,960
and I chopped the plant and usually he's

1039
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,280
got a hand on it when I cut it so that

1040
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,519
it doesn't Timber you know and I just

1041
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,160
cut that son of a [ __ ] right to the

1042
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,318
ground just Timber

1043
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,440
and it hit the floor and he looked at me

1044
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:31,559
like what the hell man and I was like

1045
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,639
there's powdery mildew on it we're

1046
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,039
throwing the whole plant away yeah it

1047
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,078
happens I mean people ask me all the

1048
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,759
time well how do you know if it works

1049
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,240
that's how thousands and thousands of

1050
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,480
dollars worth of just r d try try but if

1051
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,358
you're going to try something crazy try

1052
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,400
it on one plant if you have the option

1053
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,440
don't do something ridic don't defoliate

1054
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,920
I've been trying extreme defoliation on

1055
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,318
one plant I won't do it to more than one

1056
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,000
I I see a difference and I like it

1057
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:56,880
honestly guys I doubted it in the the

1058
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,039
beginning but I like it and I I learned

1059
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,200
this the hard way um in every scientific

1060
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,159
experiment for God's sake make sure you

1061
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,719
have a

1062
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,318
control and maybe take some notes

1063
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,559
exactly we're high and we forget a lot

1064
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:12,079
of [ __ ] yeah cuz you don't want to run a

1065
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,440
six-month trial to the end of [ __ ] take

1066
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,680
pictures if you can post them on

1067
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,760
Instagram then it'll stay there stay

1068
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,279
there so you have notes uh we we should

1069
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,040
go for about five more minutes guys the

1070
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,599
last episode was short and you listen to

1071
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:23,480
every minute of it I can see the stats I

1072
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,559
can tell how long you listen holy crap

1073
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,920
thanks for listening to the whole thing

1074
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,799
that was cool I appreciate that I hope

1075
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,559
you like that solo episode it's hard to

1076
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,160
do solo shows I feel like we covered do

1077
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,880
the Molasses thing is going to be the

1078
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,598
groundbreaker for the episode I like

1079
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,200
that we covered soil pretty well do you

1080
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,119
have any wrap-up notes for soil um keep

1081
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,639
it simple there you go keep it simple

1082
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,720
Stoner that's what I would say that's

1083
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,000
