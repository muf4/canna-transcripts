need new seeds in your garden I highly

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:29,670
recommend seeds here now and you can

8

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,570
the label says that this product

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,390
THC and eighty five point five percent

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,429
total cannabinoids apothecary has

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,789
recently started releasing the premium

14
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,710
rosin the sh o rosin I was reluctant to

15
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,510
buy it because it is at a higher price

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,789
point and I did not want to fall in love

17
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,689
with it but I think I might be in love

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,789
the aroma is ridiculous I always say

19
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,709
that there is a strong aroma coming from

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,260
these concentrates there's something

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,618
different about the rosin concentrate

22
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,688
the aroma is more like the plant it is

23
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,728
more similar to the essence of the way

24
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,949
that plants smelled while it was growing

25
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,739
and it's got a hint of that dried and

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,509
cured plant smell as well the Ambrosia's

27
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,129
and the batter's get the essence of the

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,719
Terps of what the plant smells like when

29
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,908
it was alive when it was growing when it

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,368
was fresh I think the rosin gets a

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,140
fuller more of a cannabis flavored

32
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,909
profile something that a cannabis smoker

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,640
is more familiar with if you've never

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,200
smoked pho and you smoked the rosin you

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,849
may say what is the flavor coming out of

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,920
that BHO you may think it's fake because

37
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,949
it is Souter P the Terps are so

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,070
prevalent in a different way this rosin

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,868
has a cannabis based flavor to it

40
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,309
and unless you've smoked a lot of

41
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,780
concentrates that may sound weird but

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,540
there is much more of a cannabis

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,920
dominant familiar flavor to this rosin I

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,170
really like it of course it's got me

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,859
[ __ ] rambley it's got my eyes nice

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,978
and heavy

47
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,409
something about a BHO or a diamond or a

48
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,299
sauce or an ambrosia or a shatter dab

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,799
even when I smoked that it makes me feel

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,630
like I'm kind of bug eyed like almost

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,140
caffeinated off of the amount of THC

52
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:10,228
that has entered my body so quickly when

53
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,719
I smoked there the SH o the rosin it

54
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,290
makes my eyes go droopy my eyes are

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,750
heavy my eyes feel

56
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:20,408
I feel like I get really high from the

57
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,329
BHO and I got really stoned from the Sh

58
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,679
oh so I'm not sure if that's a good

59
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,810
description for people that don't get to

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,780
smoke every day but the buzz is

61
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,789
different the feeling in my lungs are

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,019
absolutely noticeably different it feels

63
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:33,789
a little bit thicker a little bit

64
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,260
heavier which that makes sense because I

65
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:39,310
can see the consistency of these

66
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:41,739
products this is almost like a heavier

67
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,049
thicker version of the batter that I

68
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,810
smoked on a regular basis but it is just

69
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,730
thicker and it feels like I get just I

70
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,620
just need a little bit smaller of a dab

71
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,840
of this and I get as much smoke and it

72
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,069
really punches me so big shout out to

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,810
our friends at apothecary I didn't mean

74
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:57,488
to talk about the new concentrate for

75
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,400
two minutes but I really appreciate the

76
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,819
flavor the aroma the buzz the flavor is

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,620
crazy

78
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:04,298
it's intense it just lingers on your

79
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,120
mouth it leaves that weed flavor that's

80
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:09,639
what I miss from the BHO so it leaves

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,109
that that cannabis that when used to

82
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,930
smoke a joint there was a flavor to it

83
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,700
that is back with the rosin so shout out

84
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,739

all right podcast world at the start of

113
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,959
the show I said that I was going to

114
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:18,668
answer a few grow questions recently I

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,589
was asked a question by a friend he sent

116
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:21,968
me a picture of via email I did not

117
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,038
print out the message because I can

118
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:26,139
cover it without printing that paper so

119
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:27,240
let's talk about his question he sent me

120
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,280
a picture he is

121
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,228
using a root pot he's got a fabric pot

122
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,149
his plants look beautiful and healthy

123
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:35,159
the room looks nice and clean everything

124
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,719
looks stellar he's got his plants worked

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,580
into a nice trellis so he's developing a

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
nice canopy everything looks real sexy

127
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,649
in there my friends one major concern

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,038
was hey Rasta Jeff why do I have roots

129
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:49,168
growing out of the bottom of my pots so

130
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,240
my friend is using a root pot like a

131
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:53,549
fabric pot is a there are many different

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,949
types of them available now just a giant

133
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,478
fabric bag basically into the shape of a

134
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,038
root pot so it's got a lot of breathing

135
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,228
room for your root zone it's basically a

136
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,879
big potato sack that you fill with soil

137
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:04,829
or soilless mix and you put your plant

138
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,228
in there and it grows really happily

139
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,908
because the plastic doesn't allow as

140
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,918
much airflow if you're using a plastic

141
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,839
pot you restrict a lot of air flow to

142
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,519
your root zone so your roots are growing

143
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,288
through the medium they're like hey

144
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,879
there's oxygen this way they go that way

145
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:19,408
they get to the edge of that root pot

146
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,848
and they say ooh there's more air out

147
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,408
there and they grow through right

148
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:24,509
through that root pot those roots are

149
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:26,158
looking for oxygen while they're doing

150
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,780
that they are also looking for more food

151
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,939
hopefully they find water and food at

152
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,619
the end of their voyage

153
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:34,589
those plants that have got the roots

154
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,840
growing out of that bag are simply so

155
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,478
happy that the roots have just grown

156
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,908
right out of the bottom of that bag you

157
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,610
do have the possibility of those plants

158
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:46,259
becoming root bound in the near future

159
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,210
but with the size of the plants that I

160
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,189
saw and the size of the container that I

161
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:53,098
saw I don't think that is going to be a

162
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,810
problem until late in Flour if not all

163
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,788
the way to the end I think you've chosen

164
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,158
the right size pot for the length of

165
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:00,779
what you are growing that plant but what

166
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,120
is happening is some of your roots are

167
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,698
so happy and so excited that they're

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,530
just outgrowing their space they want to

169
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,509
see what's on the other side of that

170
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,609
wall and that wall is just a little thin

171
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,629
fabric line so they were able to wiggle

172
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,069
the way right through there

173
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,439
and now the roots are simply on the

174
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,939
other side now the roots that I saw

175
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,680
sticking out of the bottom of the pot

176
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,199
were at the very bottom corner of the

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,509
pot where I would assume when you water

178
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,580
that plant a little bit of water stands

179
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,288
in that area you get some runoff out of

180
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,000
the bottom of the pot you probably have

181
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,709
an inch maybe a half-inch deep worth of

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,538
water just chill in there for a short

183
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,008
duration of time until you either suck

184
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,449
it up with a shop vac or it drains

185
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,158
somehow or maybe you just let it

186
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,408
evaporate whatever works in your

187
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:41,099
environment works but I'm thinking that

188
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:42,569
those

189
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,270
nutrients that little puddle of water

190
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,159
that moisture and then that dries up

191
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,689
you've got that very thin boundary for

192
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,610
the roots the roots just say hey this is

193
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,740
a really cool direction for us to go and

194
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,060
made it start going that way from the

195
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,560
pictures I saw it looked like these

196
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,089
plants are very healthy they're very

197
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,399
happy and it looks like that grow room

198
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,869
is very well taken care of so I don't

199
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,819
think you're going to see any problems

200
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,920
because of that root growing out of the

201
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,709
bottom of that pot it is actually a sign

202
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,170
that you were doing a very good job now

203
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,879
if you were still in veg and the pot was

204
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,500
smaller and the plant were larger and we

205
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,209
knew that you had much more time to go

206
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,610
in that container that could be a

207
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,649
concern but since you were as far along

208
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,150
as you are and those roots are that size

209
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,179
I think you were timing it just

210
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,889
perfectly when you were growing cannabis

211
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,780
part of your goal is to select the

212
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,120
appropriate size container to be

213
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,739
completely efficient too small of a

214
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,509
container you'll get root bound you'll

215
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,949
have to water way too frequently it

216
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,659
becomes difficult if you're running like

217
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,610
a 1 gallon pot and your plant gets big

218
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,439
you may have to water multiple times a

219
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,449
day if you've got an auto watering

220
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,860
system that's awesome if you're a home

221
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,719
grower and you got a water by hand and

222
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,879
you've got multiple plants that can be a

223
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,220
pain in the ass so selecting the

224
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,779
appropriate sized pot is very important

225
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,610
when you're growing in a home grow

226
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,469
without an auto watering system and

227
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,129
you're running in a soilless mix or even

228
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,800
in cocoa

229
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,569
the idea is to choose the size of

230
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,030
container to where when those plants are

231
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,849
getting harvested you want them to just

232
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,500
achieve rootbound status like you got to

233
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,240
go oh man they're rootbound now oh it's

234
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,800
okay they're harvesting tomorrow that's

235
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,600
how you want that to time out you want

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,730
to fill that bottom container at the

237
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,430
same time that the top part finishes

238
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,379
I feel like too many people overlook the

239
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,939
importance of the root zone the roots

240
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,939
are where it all starts healthy roots

241
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,889
healthy fruits fat roots fat fruits it

242
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,480
all translates it all makes sense the

243
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,029
root zone is where it's all happening if

244
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,680
you have a healthy active root zone that

245
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,659
you're probably hopefully inoculating

246
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,180
with some sort of beneficial funguses

247
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,149
some sort of root inoculant that will

248
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,549
help you reduce the risk of pathogens

249
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,159
and pests those things want to go to

250
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,079
weaker plants and healthy plants start

251
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,850
at a healthy root zone that moves up

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,060
through the plant and those plants don't

253
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,190
get diseases and pests and plants with a

254
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,989
big fat healthy root system are much

255
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,760
more forgiving if you make a mistake

256
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,039
a grower and your plants have little

257
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,169
shitty roots they may die from a very

258
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,389
simple mistake if you've got plants with

259
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:04,919
big fat lush healthy roots you might be

260
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,689
able to abuse them a little bit and they

261
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,569
can still recover because they've got

262
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,070
enough life source to survive no I do

263
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,050
have a little bit of a follow-up to this

264
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,050
question somebody else said are these

265
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:18,629
mushrooms in my soilless mix a problem

266
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,549
now I'm sure there are a lot of growers

267
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,490
out there who have grown with sunshine

268
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:26,039
mix number four or Fox farms ocean

269
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,019
forest or maybe some of that 7:07 stuff

270
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,049
or that roots organic stuff and you have

271
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,240
all seen those gold cap mushrooms pop up

272
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,649
either on the top of the soil or they

273
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,850
come out of the bottom of the pots where

274
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,169
you got the little drainage holes you

275
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,240
just get a couple of smurfy looking

276
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:41,069
mushrooms growing out of there in my

277
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,440
experience those mushrooms usually pop

278
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,200
up late in veg it seems like they like

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,520
the late veg environment something about

280
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,379
the temperature something about the

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
humidity maybe it's something to do with

282
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,730
the nutrients but that is usually when I

283
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,580
discover those little golden mushrooms

284
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,500
popping up in the soilless mix in my

285
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,870
experience those mushrooms have never

286
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,120
been a problem those mushrooms have

287
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,639
always appeared when my garden was at

288
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,870
its peak optimal state so if you are

289
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,970
getting those mushrooms you were

290
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,549
probably doing something right you have

291
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,320
probably got a nice healthy root zone

292
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:15,120
you are probably watering properly

293
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,129
you're probably getting enough drainage

294
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,950
you've probably got enough oxygen your

295
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:22,289
VPD is probably just right I have always

296
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,259
taken those golden mushrooms as a sign

297
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,240
that I am doing a good job I also like

298
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,159
to let those mushrooms fall back into

299
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,829
that soil and decompose I feel like they

300
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,328
give life back to that soil and now that

301
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,799
I'm watching that cycle happen in my

302
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,120
head that is probably where the

303
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,370
mushrooms came from there were probably

304
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,409
just spores in that soil we gave them

305
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,659
the perfect environment they decided to

306
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,578
develop into mushrooms then they are

307
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,370
going to decompose and fall back into

308
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,919
the soil and give our plants life there

309
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,078
is no competition between our cannabis

310
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,179
plant and the mushroom that is growing

311
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,949
on that soilless mix they are using

312
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,319
completely different things to survive

313
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,810
that mushroom will not cause any harm to

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,730
your plant in fact that mushroom may

315
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,349
actually help speed up the breakdown of

316
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,690
some of the things that are in that

317
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,909
soilless mix and make those elements

318
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,100
more bioavailable to our

319
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:13,620
so they work sort of similarly to our

320
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,269
little wiggler worms in a very different

321
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,730
way so if you've got those golden

322
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,129
mushrooms there is not a problem in your

323
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,690
container it is probably a good sign it

324
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,090
means that you were doing a good job and

325
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,950
those spores probably came free in your

326
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,399
bag of soil they're nothing to worry

327
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,170
about

328
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,779
let them keep growing until they fall

329
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,819
over and die let them decompose then

330
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,079
they will provide even more nutrition to

331
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
your plants while they're alive they

332
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,500
break down things then once they die

333
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,600
they fall back into your soil they

334
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,070
decompose and they continue the cycle of

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,269
life so if you've got some roots

336
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,100
sticking out of the bottom you're

337
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,600
probably doing a good job if you've got

338
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,009
some golden mushrooms growing out of the

339
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,110
top or growing out of your drainage

340
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,809
holes you are probably doing a good job

341
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,220
with your soil keep it up now here's

342
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,719
another thing I should talk about while

343
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm on this subject this was not on my

344
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,540
notes this is just something that popped

345
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,180
into my head while I was ranting about

346
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,879
this a lot of people have begun making

347
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,209
super soil or some sort of a living soil

348
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,769
or a premix soil that doesn't require

349
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,330
nutrients at every watering something

350
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,309
that you just give it water and an

351
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,170
occasional tea and it keeps the plant

352
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:15,269
sustain through most of its life you may

353
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,099
have to top dress at some point it may

354
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,980
be beneficial to give it specific teas

355
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,480
to support specific phases of growth but

356
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,970
the main idea that a lot of people are

357
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,550
heading for is a super soil mix that you

358
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,680
premix and then the idea is that you put

359
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:31,229
a bunch of amendments and a base soil

360
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,969
together you mix it up and you put some

361
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,240
water in there and you store it in a

362
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,310
warm place and that water the air all of

363
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,139
those amendments and that warmth create

364
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:42,149
life inside of that container where all

365
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,639
of your stuff is mixed up and it becomes

366
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,220
alive that is called the cooking process

367
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,990
so when you make a super soil basically

368
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,370
you throw a big tarp on the floor you'll

369
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,440
put down a few bags of your base

370
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,779
soilless mix and then you will mix in

371
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,490
various amendments based on what you

372
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,500
want to do with your super soil

373
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,389
so whatever amendments you have chosen

374
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,730
we mix them up in the appropriate ratios

375
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,199
along with that base soilless mix then

376
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,789
you may sprinkle a little bit of water

377
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,950
on it now or you may scoop it into

378
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,209
containers depending on how much mix you

379
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,610
have made some people will scoop it

380
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,660
right into a large trash can some people

381
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,009
scoop it into some of those like

382
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,049
Rubbermaid shipping or storage

383
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,939
containers whatever container you put it

384
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,349
in that's up to you you may need to add

385
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,970
a little bit of water in there just to

386
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,889
get it activated just to get it moving

387
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,500
then you want to seal it up

388
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:27,330
then you want to put it in a warm place

389
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,850
the combination of the water those live

390
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,160
amendments that warmth the air in there

391
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,990
they all start creating life that soil

392
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,449
all of those amendments start doing a

393
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,950
process that we call cooking all of your

394
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,810
organic amendments start breaking down

395
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,030
naturally and making themselves more

396
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:44,129
bioavailable to our plants so that when

397
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,679
we put a plant in this soil we've got

398
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:48,899
organic soil that is ready to go it is

399
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,969
enriched it is well balanced and the

400
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,409
plants will love it so you've got your

401
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,460
stuff all mixed up you throw it in your

402
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,719
containers you've got just enough

403
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,400
moisture in there to get everything

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,290
alive you put a lid on it you throw it

405
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,509
in a warm place and you just leave it

406
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:02,309
for a few days depending on your goal

407
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,750
depending on your mix some people will

408
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,489
let it sit for seven some will go

409
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,799
fourteen some people like to go thirty

410
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,870
some people like as much as a 60 day

411
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,909
cook on their super soil that is all

412
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,560
about your preference that is all about

413
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,089
your goal that is all about your

414
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,099
amendments there are many ways to do it

415
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,139
there is no wrong way unless your plants

416
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,029
die do what works for your plants do

417
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,819
what works for you that is not the point

418
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,909
here my point is during that cooking

419
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,850
process you need to check on your super

420
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,829
soil occasionally to see the progress

421
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,779
some people like to stir it some people

422
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,480
prefer not to disturb it I am NOT a

423
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,009
super soil expert or a maker so I don't

424
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,840
have a preference on that for you you

425
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,250
have to learn that yourself read the

426
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,410
recipe that you're working with maybe

427
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,179
start at build a soil calm and work your

428
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,860
way from there or check out sub cool

429
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,659
super soil recipe and work your way from

430
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,720
there see what you want to do with it

431
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,939
add subtract as you feel necessary but

432
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,980
whip up your super soil then check on it

433
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,460
in a few days here is where people make

434
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:03,389
a crucial [ __ ] mistake you're super

435
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:06,450
soil should begin to grow a nice fuzzy

436
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:07,830
white layer a funky weird [ __ ] across

437
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,240
the top of it it should start off

438
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,620
looking like maybe a little bit of a

439
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,169
spider web then it should look like you

440
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,389
almost have maybe powdery mildew or

441
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,549
almost trichomes or powdered Donuts

442
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,159
growing across the top of your soil a

443
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,929
lot of people will freak the [ __ ] out

444
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,610
when they see that they'll say oh god

445
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,919
it's all moldy what do I do

446
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,919
you [ __ ] celebrate that was the goal

447
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,689
that is mycelium that is the life source

448
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,469
that we have been trying to create in

449
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,210
that container you did it good job the

450
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,810
problem is a lot of people see that and

451
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,400
they think the

452
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,859
they have created a problem they don't

453
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,779
realize that that was the exact goal we

454
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,419
were trying to achieve so if you were

455
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,309
making a super soil please do not freak

456
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,159
out when you get that fuzzy white stuff

457
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,779
that is the magic we were trying to make

458
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,600
happen tada

459
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,069
you did it good job and I know it sounds

460
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
silly that I should even be talking

461
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,760
about this but you would be surprised

462
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,710
how many people I've heard say it in

463
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,539
person how many times I've read it in

464
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,910
forums and how many stories I've heard

465
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:08,069
about people dumping out large

466
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:10,139
containers of soil mix that they have

467
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,610
made that they had intended on using for

468
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,830
the next four or five runs in their

469
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,860
garden they spent an entire day mixing

470
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,480
it up they spent 30 days letting it cook

471
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,430
then they opened it up and went oh I

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,200
ruined it and they simply threw it all

473
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,549
away or they just dumped it in the yard

474
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,830
because they wanted to mix it out with

475
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,099
yard dirt they did not realize they just

476
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:31,170
created super soil which was the goal so

477
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,970
don't be that guy don't freak out if you

478
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,949
see the mycelium that is what you were

479
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,629
trying to do boy that really took longer

480
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,030
than it was supposed to let's move

481
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,129
forward with more grow questions

482
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,740
another question somebody asked me about

483
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:46,320
growing was when I cut clones why do I

484
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,899
cut the tips of the leaves off of my

485
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,760
freshly cut clones so when I'm taking

486
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,529
clones to make fresh plants I usually

487
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,299
cut I'll probably cut a six to eight

488
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,829
inch section off I'll get a bunch of

489
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,539
those in a cup with some water in it

490
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,730
then I will carry those to my cloning

491
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,799
station and I will take one cutting out

492
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,110
of the water and I give that cutting

493
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,419
what I call a haircut I will take the

494
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,429
leaves and I will trim them down so the

495
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,410
leaves are kind of shaped they're shaped

496
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,090
like they get skinnier and then they get

497
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,759
fatter and they get skinnier again right

498
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,859
at the very thickest point is where I

499
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,849
like to cut them before they get fat and

500
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,349
then I cut them right there to where

501
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,689
they don't have a chance to taper back

502
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,639
to skinny so it tapers really wide I cut

503
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,259
it at the widest point now the leaves

504
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,750
are only about half the length that they

505
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,670
were when we start it then I will cut

506
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,549
the base of my stem at a 90 degree angle

507
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,900
I will trim that up a little bit kind of

508
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,149
shave it just a little bit with my

509
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,370
scissors my point is to open up that

510
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,050
outside flesh anything that is going to

511
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:41,849
get dipped in the cloning solution if

512
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,769
you're using if you're trying to stay

513
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:46,259
all organic and you want to use aloe or

514
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,579
if you're gonna use olivia's or if

515
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:50,190
you're gonna use clone x whatever you

516
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,699
choose however far you are going to dip

517
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,100
that color

518
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,779
into your cloning solution I like to

519
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,089
take my knife blade and just kind of

520
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,889
scrape that edge of that clone up just a

521
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,349
little bit and what I'm trying to do is

522
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,600
open up that outside layer open up that

523
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:05,039
fiber so the roots can grow out of that

524
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,669
more easily they're gonna grow from the

525
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,559
inside

526
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,840
I just want to lightly scrape that

527
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,279
outside skin off just a little bit I

528
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,109
don't want to go [ __ ] it up and make

529
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,839
it real rough and messy that's gonna

530
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:17,939
give it an opportunity for problems but

531
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,349
I do want to scrape it and rub it just a

532
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,990
little bit with my blade just to take

533
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,429
that outside fleshy layer off so I like

534
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,079
to give them that haircut cut them at

535
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,970
the fattest part of the leaf flip them

536
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,009
upside down give them a nice 90 degree

537
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,500
angle give them a little scraping then I

538
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:33,390
put it in my clone solution I use clone

539
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,970
X most of the time in most facilities

540
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,150
and most applications that works for me

541
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,440
you do what works for you somebody's

542
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,080
gonna send me an email and tell me I

543
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,029
prefer this good job you use the product

544
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,799
that is working for you I love it that

545
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,970
people have different options and that

546
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,549
different things work for different

547
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,799
people you use whatever works you dip

548
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,750
your clone into that then you put that

549
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,450
clone into in this situation we're going

550
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,190
to go into a rapid Rooter and that rapid

551
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,720
Rooter or a root riot or whatever type

552
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,610
of plug you're gonna use they're all

553
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,559
very similar they will all work in my

554
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:07,889
opinion whatever works for you again you

555
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,960
do that I've got 50 rapid rooters in a

556
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,150
tray and that tray has an insert that

557
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,650
keeps the rapid rooters in place there

558
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,350
in ten rows of five

559
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,330
I like that amount of clones per tray

560
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,469
because I can fill up two trays I know

561
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,909
that's 100 clones

562
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,519
that's a really efficient amount of

563
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,440
space it works really well the problem

564
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,930
is those trays are designed to have

565
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,170
those plugs really closely so they can

566
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,299
fit 50 of them into one tray the roots

567
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,240
the cubes work really well that closely

568
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,950
together the leaves up top kind of make

569
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,039
a mess when you have too many of them

570
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,500
that leafy that closely together you get

571
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,899
humidity issues you get transpiration

572
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,549
and respiration issues plants that are

573
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,440
on top of each other that are resting on

574
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:51,960
top of each other really have a lot of

575
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,559
potential to cause problems imagine if

576
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,809
all day

577
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,629
I just put my sweaty arm right across

578
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,399
your sweaty chess just all day in the

579
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,550
middle of the summer in a clone dome

580
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,410
just sweaty sticky stagnant you're gonna

581
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,690
get pissed off at my arm at about five

582
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,100
minutes but you're a plant you can't

583
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,850
move it you just got to sit there and

584
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,769
deal with it

585
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:12,240
that's what it is like if you've got

586
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,160
them too close together if they're all

587
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,630
crushed together the first thing is they

588
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,490
don't like being crammed together like

589
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,650
that and it will lead to problems down

590
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,650
the road these clones are going to be in

591
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,560
this dome for probably 14 ish days maybe

592
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,300
10 maybe 20 depending on your experience

593
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,500
depending on your cultivar you've got a

594
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,419
lot of options there but they're going

595
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,009
to be in there for a long enough time to

596
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,750
where we need to put some care into this

597
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,150
before we set ourselves up for failure

598
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,039
you've got the option to set yourself up

599
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,530
for success from the beginning let's

600
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,269
take all of the appropriate steps so I

601
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,609
like to cut the tips of the leaves off

602
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,410
because first it prevents the leaves

603
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:48,509
from resting on each other too

604
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,000
ridiculously there's enough foliage in

605
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:52,559
there even after I do the trim all that

606
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,880
excess foliage would just cause me

607
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,299
problems so I'm getting that out of

608
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,030
there

609
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,529
I am eliminating potential problems now

610
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:00,690
there is another reason why I cut the

611
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:04,170
tips off of those leaves I feel like the

612
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,930
less leaf there is on that plant is the

613
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,580
less that there is to try for that plant

614
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,560
to support that plant doesn't have a

615
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,990
root system it was living off of the

616
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,119
root system now it's only way to live is

617
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,769
through the leaves now I said that I

618
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,939
want to cut a bunch of that leaf off so

619
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,910
you're like wait how is it gonna live

620
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,009
imagine if you had 12-foot arms and you

621
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,150
had to hold the other six foot of your

622
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,650
arm up all the time

623
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,940
your arms gonna get exhausted you're

624
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,220
gonna use all of your energy just trying

625
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,080
to hold your arms out all day long now

626
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,700
that you've only got like probably two

627
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,419
something foot my arms are long so I'm

628
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,860
six five

629
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,269
you probably got two foot long arms

630
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,250
right it doesn't take a lot of energy to

631
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,839
hold those out you can do that you're

632
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,460
not gonna spend all of your calories all

633
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,339
of your life source trying to keep your

634
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,799
arms up so if you've got less plant it's

635
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:49,409
just less to sustain it is less stress

636
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,899
on the plant that plant only has so much

637
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,090
energy so let's not make it spin so much

638
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,470
energy keeping those leaves upright so

639
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:56,759
it can survive let's just cut it to

640
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,960
where they're short and then you notice

641
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,879
when they're shorter they kind of want

642
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,860
to stick up anyway so let's trim them

643
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,570
down a little bit and help them survive

644
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,729
we want to set ourselves up for a

645
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:07,710
success and by trimming those leaves we

646
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,630
kind of minimize transpiration that

647
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,940
gives us an advantage in the clone dome

648
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,980
I also think that when we cut those

649
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,779
leaves that the plant goes into sort of

650
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,250
a panic mode and it sort of knows it's

651
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,109
like hey I better route

652
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,000
because I'm getting all beat up up here

653
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:23,339
I better start doing something down here

654
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,349
so that I can survive now there is a

655
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,149
very fine line when cutting clones we

656
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:29,939
need enough leaf to keep a plant alive

657
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,530
but we don't want too much leaf to try

658
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,019
to sustain while we don't have a root

659
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:35,579
system we need just enough leaf to keep

660
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,710
the plant functioning to where it can

661
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,230
survive without a root system until it

662
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,970
develops roots but we also don't need so

663
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,009
many leaves that that plant can't

664
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,048
sustain those leaves without a root

665
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:48,359
system it's a very fine line we also

666
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:50,250
need to think about hormones each of

667
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,288
those leaves and shoots contain hormones

668
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,019
that contribute to the function of the

669
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:57,329
plant if we leave some of the shoots and

670
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,329
take off the leaves we will preserve

671
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:03,000
hormones and that will increase overall

672
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:05,189
success rate of our clones and our domes

673
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,859
so it is a good idea to remove as much

674
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:10,048
leaf as possible but be mindful that you

675
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:12,269
are also taking out hormones there is a

676
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:14,308
fine balance just like everything we do

677
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,349
in cannabis there is a balance there is

678
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:18,240
a pro and a con there's always some kind

679
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:20,788
of a balance and you always have to find

680
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,130
the fine line most of the time it is

681
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:25,440
phenotype specific so you just have to

682
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,809
develop a relationship with your plants

683
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,909
some plants are really challenging to

684
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:31,529
clone some plants will clone just by

685
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,940
looking at them you can knock a cutting

686
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:34,048
off and set it in a cup of water and

687
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,419
come back in the next day you got a

688
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:38,759
whole [ __ ] rooted plant some are not

689
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:41,429
that easy some plants really like to be

690
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:44,129
cloned in a rapid Rooter and dome type

691
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,530
of a setup some plants really prefer a

692
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,390
turbo cloner or easy cloner a narrow

693
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:51,269
clone or type of environment sometimes

694
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,309
it is very clone specific very strange

695
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,589
specific you may need to work on each

696
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:57,418
specific cultivar and get them figured

697
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:59,069
out sometimes in a commercial

698
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,659
environment I know which strains work

699
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:02,579
well together they go in this dome

700
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,440
sometimes I'll have a dome that is only

701
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,139
half full because it's a very specific

702
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,640
strain that is just that I need 25 of

703
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,919
these I'm gonna do them by theirselves

704
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,299
so that they have a better chance of

705
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,159
surviving I know they need to stay

706
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,869
sealed up for a few more days or they

707
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,370
need to be opened sooner or whatever I

708
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,619
know that those need special attention

709
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:21,989
so I will fill one dome with just that

710
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,819
one strain and treat it special on its

711
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,890
own that may be what you have to do to

712
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,558
get your clones to root that puts me off

713
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,870
on another side tangent our friend mr.

714
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,149
soll has recently reminded us too

715
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:36,299
start taking the domes off of our clones

716
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,400
sooner mr. soll and I see eye to eye on

717
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,769
many things this is one of them in

718
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,040
commercial facilities I quite often see

719
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:46,139
clones in domes that the dome has been

720
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,700
on there for far too long we can get

721
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,259
that dome off of there we can get those

722
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,150
clones active acclimated to the

723
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,490
environment get them out of that clone

724
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,130
situation and into some dirt much more

725
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:59,160
quickly if we start burping the clones

726
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,559
sooner and start gradually getting them

727
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,179
used to that open environment then just

728
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:04,769
remove the dome and let them live in

729
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,380
that tray for a couple of days with no

730
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,509
dome and they will be okay so let's work

731
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,400
on getting the clones off of the domes

732
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,500
earlier and we will see healthier

733
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,610
starting baby plants what is happening

734
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,619
is they're trapped in that environment

735
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:18,209
they can't thrive they can't expand

736
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:19,469
their roots are stuck they're pissed off

737
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,990
they're not getting the appropriate

738
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,579
nutrients they want to grow they start

739
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,500
getting nutrient deficiencies because

740
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,839
they're just angry for being trapped in

741
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,940
a little tiny dome in a little cube so

742
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,579
let's try to speed that process up get

743
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,070
them out of there and once again let's

744
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:38,189
do what we can to set ourselves up for a

745
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:41,159
success every day of every phase counts

746
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,570
in this new cannabis industry now since

747
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,130
we're talking about cologne domes I've

748
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:47,399
got one more great thing to add to that

749
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,890
if you were using an auto cloner an easy

750
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,360
clone or a turbo cloner whatever kind of

751
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,300
cloner you were using that is an aero

752
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,969
clone or type machine you do not need a

753
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:59,789
dome on that clone machine I find it

754
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,009
really silly to put a cloner on that

755
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:03,899
machine I find it really detrimental it

756
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:06,058
kind of slows you down it does more harm

757
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,759
then it does good if you were using a

758
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:10,230
turbo cloner an easy cloner whatever

759
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,490
brand it is I don't care if it's spring

760
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,799
from the bottom and you're getting your

761
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,990
roots missed in from the bottom you do

762
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,599
not need a dome on that clone or if you

763
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,549
take healthy cuts and you you can either

764
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,889
cut the base of that cut at a 45 degree

765
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,589
angle or for an easy cloner what I like

766
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,090
to do is cut that clone right up the

767
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,589
center of the stick I don't go too far

768
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:30,419
maybe a quarter of an inch is all you

769
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,589
need right in the middle boom now it

770
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,789
looks like you just took your your

771
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,980
forefinger and your middle finger that

772
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:36,569
are together now you just go and just

773
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
put a little slit right between them now

774
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,139
I think that when the water from that ez

775
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,569
cloner sprays up there it will start to

776
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,009
roll those tips up and the roots will

777
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,759
grow out of that little slit that you

778
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,140
just made

779
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,690
it is beautiful when you see it you'll

780
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,430
say holy [ __ ] that worked really well so

781
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,029
I like to cut a little slit right in the

782
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,640
middle of it

783
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:55,259
then dip it in my I use clone axe we

784
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,540
talked about this earlier use whatever

785
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,819
solution you like I use clone axe I dip

786
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:02,759
it in there then I put it in a perma

787
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,139
clone reusable clone caller from a clone

788
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,059
doesn't pay me I just think they are

789
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,520
great because they're reusable and I can

790
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,740
fit two cuts in one collar so quite

791
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,930
often you will find two clones per clone

792
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,509
collar when I'm using a perma clone so

793
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,310
you put it in the clone Ex gel you put

794
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,230
it in your permalink clone collar you

795
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,919
set it in the turbo cloner and you

796
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,960
forget it

797
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,850
if you have got the nutrients and your

798
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,950
turbo cloner dialed in correctly and

799
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,409
you've got your pH and your turbo cloner

800
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:31,470
dialed in correctly you will not have to

801
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,090
put a dome over those plants ever that

802
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,730
arrow cloner should be spraying

803
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:37,919
constantly if you do run into heat

804
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,990
issues you can do a cycle where the pump

805
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,430
is off and on for certain durations just

806
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,589
give it time to cool so that the water

807
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,029
doesn't heat up to it too ridiculously

808
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:47,039
hot because those pumps will heat up

809
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,720
your water depending on the size of your

810
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,639
cloner and your environment you may need

811
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,279
to give it a break I have had great

812
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,900
success running at 24 hours a day I have

813
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,940
had great success running it for

814
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,420
different intervals maybe like 45

815
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,640
seconds on in 15 seconds off maybe 30

816
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,380
minutes on and 10 minutes off a lot of

817
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,420
different cycles have worked for me if

818
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,760
you've got to experiment to keep your

819
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,830
water cool do the experiments that are

820
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,390
necessary let's get back on track here

821
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:14,639
you've got the water spraying up from

822
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,750
the bottom if you've got the pH dialed

823
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,360
in you've got your nutrient solution

824
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,039
correct you do not need to put a dome

825
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,439
over those plants they are going to be

826
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,759
so happy about that water spraying up

827
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,410
their little butt that they're just

828
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,839
gonna start dancing and they're going to

829
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,700
develop roots in seven to ten days and

830
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,250
these plants will be vigorous and

831
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,309
healthy but keep in mind I keep saying

832
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,980
this will only work if your pH and your

833
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:39,869
EC or ppm s are dialed in in your

834
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,759
cloning machine you have got to have the

835
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:44,729
proper numbers in there you have also

836
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,799
got to maintain the proper numbers in

837
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,710
your cloning machine you have got water

838
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,909
creating a bubbly mist all day long and

839
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,039
spraying at the roots of these plants

840
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,160
all day long in that machine you can

841
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,440
hear it from across the room

842
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,690
all day long that thing is moving that

843
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,940
water hasn't stopped you are going to

844
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,009
get evaporation you are going to get

845
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,450
slight leak sout of that machine anybody

846
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,650
there's ran that machine knows that

847
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,930
there's going to be a drip from

848
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,840
somewhere all the time you're going to

849
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,269
lose water also your plants are going to

850
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,309
be drinking some of that water you are

851
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:19,910
going to need to check on the water

852
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:21,769
level of that machine on a regular basis

853
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,210
if you're in a commercial facility the

854
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:25,460
first thing you should do when you get

855
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,279
there is check on the cloner is the pump

856
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,779
on is it making a funny noise does it

857
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,029
sound like it's spraying correctly if

858
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:33,649
it's spraying correctly you got a risk

859
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,660
just a couple of seconds of your life

860
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,070
and lift it up and look in there and see

861
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,150
if any of the sprayers are clogged I

862
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,379
know it's a real [ __ ] you're gonna get

863
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,269
sprayed first thing in the morning

864
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,220
you're awake now let's get it on just

865
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:44,930
lift that lid up and look and see where

866
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,120
all the clones getting sprayed if they

867
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,640
are you're good now you got to unplug it

868
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,349
now you get your EC meter or your ppm

869
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,390
meter whichever one you're using and

870
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:55,069
your pH meter and just stick them right

871
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,480
in that nutrient solution the machine is

872
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:58,309
off at this point you take the lid off

873
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,380
carefully don't break the bottoms any of

874
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,149
those clones but then you put your ppm

875
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,740
or your EC meter in there and your pH

876
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,350
meter in there and just test that

877
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,599
solution what are your numbers is your

878
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:11,389
pH in the acceptable range are your

879
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:14,269
PPM's in the acceptable range if not

880
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,850
adjust that [ __ ] is the water at the

881
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,400
correct height if not correct that [ __ ]

882
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:21,589
write it down I have a sticker on the

883
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,080
front of my cloner that shows when Mike

884
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:25,639
Lohner was last checked and who checked

885
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,099
it you just we have little stickers you

886
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,200
just write your name rhasta Jeff at 4:20

887
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:32,089
on Monday put that little sticker on

888
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,819
there now I'm accountable for that I

889
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:37,279
know that on 4/20 on Monday I checked it

890
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:39,019
the PPM's were cool the EC was cool the

891
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,109
water was cool all the plants looked

892
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:44,720
happy everything was fine also I have

893
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:47,000
another sticker on there that says res

894
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,500
clear I like to put res clear in my ez

895
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,390
cloners that makes sure that I don't get

896
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,950
any funky algae or anything happening in

897
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,440
there it keeps my plants nice and

898
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,110
healthy I put that in there every 5 days

899
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,410
so I will write a little note res clear

900
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,689
on Monday January 1st so I know that on

901
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,670
January 6th I know I need to put some

902
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,400
res clear in there but my main point

903
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,710
here is you don't need a dome on your

904
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,538
cloning machine that

905
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,028
Spray that comes from the bottom if your

906
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:15,250
nutrients and your pH and your EC and

907
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:16,929
your ppm and your water is not too hot

908
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,940
if everything is dialed in they are

909
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,548
going to love getting sprayed from the

910
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,130
bottom and they do not need a dome you

911
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:26,408
are only slowing yourself down by

912
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:29,169
putting a dome on plants that are in an

913
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:31,390
easy cloner then you have to adjust them

914
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:33,070
to the non domed environment if you

915
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,899
don't ever give them a dome they don't

916
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:37,028
know what that life was like they don't

917
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:39,278
ever need it again the reason we put a

918
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,690
dome on the clones that are in the rapid

919
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,669
rooters is because they're not getting

920
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,590
sprayed and there are little bombs with

921
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:46,630
constant fresh nutrient water they've

922
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:48,308
got to kind of learn to develop roots to

923
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,809
get the water they've got to eat from

924
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,819
the air they've got to eat from that

925
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:53,769
humidity that is kept in that domed

926
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:55,480
environment that is their only life

927
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,829
source they don't have roots they're not

928
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,110
getting a little bit de spray to get

929
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:02,109
tickled and kept alive so that is why I

930
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:04,599
feel it is silly and almost detrimental

931
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:07,058
to your garden to put a dome on your

932
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,980
clones that are in an easy cloning type

933
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,329
machine now I've got one more thing to

934
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,880
talk about we are going to start

935
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:14,889
wrapping up this podcast the last part

936
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,190
of this episode is I do not find it

937
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,380
necessary to put a dome on seedlings I

938
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,700
feel the same thing about clones in a

939
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,700
clone machine as I do

940
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,100
ceilings with a dome over them I believe

941
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,990
that putting a dome over a seedling will

942
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:31,209
make that seedling a little [ __ ]

943
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,890
I want that seedling to grow in the

944
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,870
environment with the rest of the plants

945
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,549
it doesn't need a dome I think putting a

946
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,359
dome on it is like wrapping it up in

947
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:39,639
bubble wrap

948
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,829
it's like nerfing my seedling I want it

949
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,480
to survive I want to put a fan on my

950
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,009
ceiling so where it gets really strong

951
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,069
and gets abused from the very beginning

952
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:49,690
I want my seedlings to grow and to know

953
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:51,158
that they are not going to be babied I

954
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,870
want them to come out and go ah [ __ ] I

955
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,880
better be strong or I just might not

956
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,168
make it in this world now that may be

957
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,510
different for me because I've got

958
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,669
experience and I have access to a lot of

959
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,829
seeds and I understand that seeds are

960
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:05,110
quite expensive so people really want to

961
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:07,210
baby them and not destroy them but I

962
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:08,709
feel like by putting them in a dome or

963
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,840
putting a bag over the cup with the

964
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,730
sealing in it you were kind of slowing

965
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,408
it down you're kind of giving it a

966
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,788
participation trophy and making it a

967
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,520
little [ __ ] so I think it would be

968
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:22,160
better if we did not put domes over the

969
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,720
seedlings I also do not like to use heat

970
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,190
that's when germinating seeds I feel

971
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,410
like that sometimes will make them too

972
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,940
hot and you do have the opportunity to

973
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,340
rose to your seeds if you've got them in

974
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,990
a paper towel in the baggie then you put

975
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:35,209
them on a heat mat you're gonna cook

976
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,069
them I think that if you put them in a

977
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,019
