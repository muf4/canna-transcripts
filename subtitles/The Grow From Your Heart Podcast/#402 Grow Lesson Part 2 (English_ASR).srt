at dank seed dot store I like to start

38
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,019
the podcast off by letting you know what

39
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,539
I'm smoking today I'm taking dabs of

40
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,419
bubble Jack full-spectrum extract from

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,120
fuego extracts I really love the flavor

42
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,349
and aroma of this concentrate it smells

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,420
like Jack Herer

44
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,639
bubblegum and when you dab it it leaves

45
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,919
a sweet soft bubblegum flavor on your

46
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,229
mouth that just lingers for a long time

47
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,839
and the high goes straight to the head I

48
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,099
really like this concentrate one thing I

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,170
am going to complain about is the

50
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,599
packaging these little plastic jars get

51
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,729
stuck the Fuego jars get stuck every

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,609
time I buy them it is a pain in the ass

53
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:38,219
then they're putting the jar inside of a

54
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,800
black bag with a drawstring kind of like

55
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,719
a little tiny Crown Royal bag the jar

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,570
has stickers on it to indicate the brand

57
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,490
and the strain the little black bag has

58
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,650
a bunch of fibers that come off of it so

59
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,409
now I've got a jar that looks like it's

60
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,360
got long black hairs hanging off of it I

61
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,979
don't like that at all it's unappealing

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,350
there's no need for that bag it's a

63
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,000
waste of material it's another step in

64
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,189
the packaging process and it is

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,379
completely useless then after they've

66
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,419
put the jar in that bag they place that

67
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,129
bag inside of another box which slides

68
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,139
into another box which is all

69
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,120
beautifully decorated and well labeled

70
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:13,709
it is a lot of packaging I'm sure most

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
of that packaging is because of the

72
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,340
Colorado compliance laws but I would

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,719
like to see less packaging from the

74
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,300
concentrate companies I feel like I

75
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,590
throw away a lot of packaging alright

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,840
you guys so let me be completely clear

77
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,700
the concentrate is amazing the bubble

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,950
Jack full-spectrum extract tastes great

79
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,439
the highest perfect my only complaint is

80
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,329
with the packaging and that is not just

81
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,620
Wego I just happened to be using fuego

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,140
products today when I'm talking about

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,300
this a lot of the companies are using

84
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,339
too much packaging and I understand it's

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,050
Colorado law we've got to be compliant I

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,000
get it I just wish there was a way we

87
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,400
could do this more efficiently and more

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,930
environmentally friendly all right guys

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,450
let's move forward with the show this is

90
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,460
going to be another grow lesson this is

91
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,129
going to be the seventh lesson in a long

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,570
series of grow lessons in this episode I

93
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,120
want to talk about planning your

94
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,709
integrated pest management everybody

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,240
likes to think they will not get bugs

96
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,550
everybody likes to say that's not gonna

97
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,620
happen to me but guess what it will and

98
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,300
the only way you can prevent it is by

99
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,700
starting an integrated pest management

100
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,140
system while you're planning your grow

101
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,000
while you're setting up your grow and

102
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,919
having it in place before you ever

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,379
introduce plants into your grow

104
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,390
environment now let's talk a little bit

105
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,189
about integrated pest management what is

106
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,740
the goal of our integrated pest

107
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,110
management

108
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,470
system the ultimate goal is to keep our

109
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,090
garden free of pests and bugs a good

110
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,849
spot to start would be knowing how to

111
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:36,189
identify the bugs we are looking for and

112
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:38,409
the damage that they will leave now what

113
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:41,199
insects are we going to find in our

114
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,479
cannabis garden the most common problem

115
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,598
we are going to find is spider mites

116
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,060
spider mites are very small you are very

117
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:50,949
unlikely to see a spider mite unless you

118
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,228
flip over a leaf and look at it and do

119
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,810
some investigating what you will see is

120
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:57,158
spider mite damage if you've got a leaf

121
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,110
it looks like somebody has just been

122
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:00,668
taking a needle and poking little dots

123
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,199
in that leaf or something's been

124
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,939
sticking its fangs in there and sucking

125
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,280
the juice out of those little spots that

126
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:09,668
is spider mite damage learn how to

127
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,689
identify spider mite damage if you see

128
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:12,579
damage on a leaf

129
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,050
pull that leaf off flip it upside down

130
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,598
and look at the underside of the leaf

131
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,400
along the main vein of that leaf tucked

132
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,649
right up against that vein you will see

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,478
spider mites and spider mite eggs those

134
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,370
little dots you see those are spider

135
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,930
mite eggs those little itty bitty dots

136
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,509
that are moving those are the spider

137
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,699
mites they are there it is time to treat

138
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,348
for them depending on what cycle of

139
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,478
growth you are in treating for spider

140
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:36,279
mites can be very easy it can also be

141
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,008
kind of a pain in the ass later in Flour

142
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,869
if you learn how to identify spider my

143
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,939
damage and learn how to identify spider

144
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,530
mites finding the problem early and

145
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,319
correcting it should not be a problem

146
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:49,029
before it gets out of hand another pest

147
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,769
that is very common in the garden and

148
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,978
very easy to identify because of its

149
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:55,750
damage is a thrip a lot like a spider

150
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,818
mite the thrips like to suck the juice

151
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,829
out of our plants after they do this

152
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,080
they leave a little trail of gooey stuff

153
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:04,658
called honeydew on the leaves if you see

154
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,639
a little trail of silvery shiny shimmery

155
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:09,250
stuff left on your lower leaves you

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,930
probably have thrips if we become

157
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,060
familiar with what thrift damage looks

158
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,650
like we can identify the problem sooner

159
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,259
and that makes it really easy to

160
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,089
eradicate our problems so my point is

161
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,669
knowing what to look for will be

162
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:23,709
seriously advantageous when it comes to

163
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:25,750
treating for a pest problem

164
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,209
another common pest you're going to run

165
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,649
into is the white fly what does a white

166
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,629
fly look like it looks like a little

167
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:33,278
piece of ash just flying around just a

168
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,810
little white fly it'll start off with

169
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:36,788
two of them then the next day you'll see

170
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,600
200 of them then the next day you'll see

171
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:40,810
2,000 of

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,240
them white flies multiply rapidly but

173
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,459
once you see them they are easy to get

174
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,100
rid of if you understand how to combat

175
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,989
them so the very first step of an

176
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,810
integrated pest management system is

177
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,720
learning to identify the damage caused

178
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,670
by common garden pests once we know how

179
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,010
to identify the problems then we can

180
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,050
identify the pest then we can decide on

181
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,110
the course of action to treat that

182
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,810
problem also it is very important to

183
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,819
treat for the correct pest some

184
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,339
pesticides will work on a broad spectrum

185
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,230
of pests but if you are using specific

186
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,629
pesticides or if you're using specific

187
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,450
predatory pests you do need to use the

188
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,879
correct method of attack in today's

189
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,889
market we can't afford to spend money on

190
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,469
a product that does not specifically

191
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,539
attack our problem and also we can't

192
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,550
spend time applying a product or

193
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,290
releasing predators that are not going

194
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,900
to get in there and eradicate our

195
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,750
problems so learn how to identify the

196
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,449
signs then identify the actual pests

197
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,610
then we can dial in an attack to

198
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,620
eradicate our problem now let's talk

199
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,990
about a few ways we can prepare our grow

200
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,870
and prevent pests from entering our new

201
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,519
garden cleanliness is a huge factor when

202
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,090
it comes to keeping bugs out of our

203
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,889
garden

204
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,589
everything that goes in that garden is

205
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,060
taken in there by you you travel in and

206
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,310
out of there you take things in and out

207
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,280
it is your responsibility to control

208
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,350
what goes in and out of that grow one

209
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,989
way to prevent contaminating your garden

210
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,480
is to have a dedicated garden clothes

211
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,220
don't come from a hike don't come from

212
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,470
the gross store don't come from work

213
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,200
don't go from wherever you are into your

214
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,420
grow room have specific garden clothes

215
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
change your clothes change your shoes

216
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,020
change your hat

217
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,329
don't take your daily clothing into your

218
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:27,279
grow room who knows what's on you maybe

219
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,959
you've been petting a dog maybe the dog

220
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,689
was outside leaning against the tree

221
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,639
maybe that tree had a fits a dog came in

222
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:35,229
rubbed up against your leg you and the

223
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,788
dogs spent a minute together scratching

224
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,889
on each other then he went to the grow

225
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:41,139
you just took those aphids from the tree

226
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,029
to the dog into your garden tried to

227
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:43,598
prevent that sort of thing be very

228
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,569
careful

229
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,759
I've got dreadlocks down to my knees I

230
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,530
wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat

231
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,929
before I go into any grown

232
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,629
if you've got dreadlocks or long hair I

233
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:57,370
suggest you put it in a hat of some sort

234
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,659
maybe a hairnet whatever it takes my

235
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,850
hair would not fit in a hairnet

236
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:02,409
I wrap my dreads in a big bun on top of

237
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,149
my head I wrap that in a piece of

238
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,219
material that wraps real tight then I

239
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,569
slide a dreadlock hat over that so I'm

240
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,950
double wrapped nothing will get in

241
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,810
nothing will get out

242
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,420
I won't transfer any problems from grow

243
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:15,189
to grow or room-to-room so if you've got

244
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,870
dreadlocks or long hair I highly

245
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,340
recommend you keep it wrapped up maybe

246
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,750
in a hairnet or something similar

247
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,759
maybe a dread hat just where it's

248
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,740
contained in there and not exposed that

249
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,779
way you can prevent moving spider mites

250
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,250
around through your hair and some of you

251
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,980
guys with the big beards you may want to

252
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,659
consider a beard net also not just to

253
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,850
prevent the bugs from getting into our

254
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:35,589
hair but also to prevent our hair from

255
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,200
sticking to the buds nobody wants to buy

256
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,730
a bud with a big hair in it so change

257
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,290
your clothes keep your hair tied up and

258
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,509
then let's get back to that dog I was

259
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,250
talking about I don't recommend having

260
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,689
pets in the grow room I see a lot of

261
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,309
pictures of people with their dog or

262
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,020
their cat in the grow room talking about

263
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:52,089
it's their their guard dog or their

264
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,159
mascot that's cool if you want to do

265
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,259
that but I don't recommend it like I

266
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,240
said earlier your dog or your cat goes

267
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,319
outside it rolls around in the dirt it

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,720
rolls around in the bushes

269
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,700
it just goes everywhere who knows what

270
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,710
it's getting into then you let it walk

271
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,000
right into the garden maybe it walked up

272
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,560
right up against a plant that was

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,129
covered in spider mites and you had no

274
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,319
idea

275
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,659
now that dog is in your garden rubbing

276
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,060
up against your plants guess what free

277
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,799
spider mites for everybody I don't

278
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,579
recommend having a pet in the grow if

279
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,679
you insist

280
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,320
do your thing that is your grow but in

281
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,809
my opinion that is a huge risk for

282
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,220
bringing bugs into your garden another

283
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:29,109
thing I would recommend is that if

284
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,120
you've got an outdoor grow and an indoor

285
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,009
grow don't bring your tools from that

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,929
outdoor grow into your indoor grow

287
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,240
environment you may be bringing problems

288
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,709
and sometimes I know I sound like I

289
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,389
might just be paranoid but it's better

290
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,700
to be paranoid than to make stupid

291
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,259
mistakes now as long as you're changing

292
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,879
your clothes you're keeping your hair

293
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,230
clean you're keeping your shoes and your

294
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,759
equipment clean and you're not letting

295
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,529
your dog or your friends in your grow

296
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,990
room there shouldn't be a way for any

297
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,579
pests to get into this grow you may have

298
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,350
some cracks in the walls there may be

299
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,480
gaps in your building that's always

300
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,370
gonna happen but we're not going to drag

301
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,649
them in there on our own if they find a

302
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,029
way in we will deal with that now once

303
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,620
you're certain you've minimized the

304
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,019
opportunity for pest to entry or grow

305
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,090
through your own doing we need to think

306
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,710
about treating the clones that come into

307
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,019
our grow before they are introduced to

308
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,670
population wherever your clones come

309
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,220
from if it's your best friend if it's a

310
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,349
dispensary if it's some guy on Instagram

311
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,540
wherever they came from treat them as if

312
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,330
they are contaminated with some sort of

313
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:27,549
pest issue never introduce clones into

314
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,889
your general population without some

315
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:32,079
sort of quarantine period if your room

316
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,210
is brand new you don't have bugs

317
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,370
why take plants in there that have bugs

318
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,889
on them we can treat those plants before

319
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,200
we take them into our main grow room if

320
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,120
you've got a room with plants going why

321
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,250
would you want to introduce a plant with

322
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,039
bugs on it into that room to contaminate

323
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,230
the entire grow if you get clones from

324
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,599
anybody isolate them quarantine them

325
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,279
investigate them get a jeweler's loupe

326
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,590
and go over the leaves and see if you

327
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,079
can see any signs of bugs on the top or

328
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,450
bottoms of those leaves if you see any

329
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,220
pests now you have to decide if you want

330
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,660
to keep that clone or if you're going to

331
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,120
treat it and try to eradicate that

332
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,610
problem before you introduce that clone

333
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,960
to your general population if I got a

334
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,610
clone that had bugs on it I would

335
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,320
probably throw it away unless it were

336
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,480
some super elite cut that I could never

337
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,129
get again why start with problems

338
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,529
I wouldn't even allow that to make it

339
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,779
past quarantine if it looked like it was

340
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,220
clean I would still probably treat it I

341
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,199
would treat it with whatever pest

342
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,269
management system I have decided to work

343
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,400
with if I'm using sprays and oils

344
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:32,590
I would heavily treat it with multiple

345
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,870
oils several times it would probably

346
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,399
spend a week in quarantine the first day

347
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,990
it would get blasted with something on

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,490
day three would get blasted with

349
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,690
something different on day five

350
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,279
something different then we're gonna

351
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,290
look at it if I feel like it's safe and

352
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,629
clean I may enter general population on

353
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:49,240
day seven or it may get treated one more

354
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,919
time depending on how it looks to me if

355
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,379
I were working in a facility that did

356
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,120
not use spray applications I would put

357
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,710
that plant in an isolated area with

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,570
enough light and living conditions to

359
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,639
survive for a few days and then I would

360
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,500
start heavily applying beneficial

361
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
insects I would build up a colony of

362
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
predators on there hopefully they would

363
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
go through and eat anything that was

364
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,519
causing me a problem and by day seven I

365
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,190
would be safe to enter that clone into

366
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,840
general population but honestly if I got

367
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,730
a clone and it was contaminated I

368
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,080
probably would just destroy it it

369
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,909
wouldn't even make it past

370
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,460
inspection stage it wouldn't even get

371
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:23,919
into micro so as a grower it is your

372
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,840
responsibility to check incoming clones

373
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,189
and check them thoroughly no matter

374
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,690
where they came from if it came from

375
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,550
your best friend if it came from a

376
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,250
dispensary if it came from somebody on

377
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:35,529
the internet it is your responsibility

378
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,320
you cannot blame anybody for giving you

379
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:41,079
a clone with bugs that is your fault it

380
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,670
is not their fault so treat any incoming

381
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,340
plants as if they are contaminated

382
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:47,019
isolate them treat them and continue to

383
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,820
monitor them until you are certain the

384
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,730
problem is not there or has been

385
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,650
eradicated now another very common way

386
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,649
for people to get garden pests is

387
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,659
through store-bought soil or soilless

388
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,419
mix a lot of people try to blame

389
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:03,399
specific brands for being infested with

390
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,459
specific bugs I find that to be

391
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,350
inaccurate think about it this way brand

392
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,050
a is made in one area in California

393
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,300
brand B is probably made in another area

394
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,729
of California and brand C will just say

395
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,289
that it's manufactured in Colorado so

396
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,050
all three of those brands are made then

397
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,699
they are all shipped to a warehouse

398
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:24,819
sometimes these warehouses store their

399
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,470
soil in pallets outdoors now if one of

400
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,720
those pallets had a little bit of bugs

401
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,149
in it they started thriving in that one

402
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,100
pallet of soil then they moved over to

403
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,470
the next pallet then they moved over to

404
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,930
the next pallet now they are in brands a

405
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,450
B and C there is no way to blame a

406
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:42,370
specific soil company for giving you

407
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,990
bugs it was probably the warehouse in

408
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,120
which all of those pallets were stored

409
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,009
is where your bugs came from so let's

410
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,169
try to get away from blaming a specific

411
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,779
brand for having specific bugs in there

412
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:55,899
that's unfair and probably uh nak urine

413
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:58,600
but it is a fact that our soil does come

414
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,919
with bugs quite frequently a lot of

415
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,930
times you'll notice this when you're

416
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,399
transplanting you'll stick your hand in

417
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,049
there and a little bug will just fly

418
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,059
right up it's usually a fungus gnat or a

419
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,219
white fly it'll just fly right up out of

420
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,869
the soil you know there there now it's

421
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,750
time to start thinking about how you are

422
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,519
going to treat for those pests other

423
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,889
times you don't see those soil-borne

424
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,629
pests until the first time you water you

425
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,189
just potted all those pots you got a

426
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,049
whole bag worth of soil with uh pots

427
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,610
done you feeling really good about life

428
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,959
you got the grow room all organized you

429
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,909
mix up your nutrients you go to water

430
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,290
and that first batch of water that hits

431
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:31,088
that soil you see

432
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,708
bugs come flying out those are fresh

433
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,139
bugs they came fresh with the soil

434
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:37,239
they're not a big deal as long as we

435
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,129
know how to identify the insect and we

436
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,250
know how to properly treat for that

437
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:44,399
problem treating for soil bound pests is

438
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,419
very easy you can either purchase

439
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,269
predator insects that will get in there

440
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:51,278
and eat that specific pests or we can

441
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,139
mix up a route drench which is a basic

442
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,789
pesticide and he makes it with water and

443
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:56,259
then you water that into the plants just

444
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:58,179
like you would when you normally water

445
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:59,528
then that pesticide gets down in there

446
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:01,328
in the root zone and then it will

447
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,370
eradicate any pests that are in there

448
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:06,099
the things you're most commonly gonna

449
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,139
find in soil are going to be white flies

450
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,899
you'll probably find some fungus gnats

451
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:13,329
and I quite often have found thrips

452
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,759
in my soil so just know that your soil

453
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:17,739
may have bugs in it be aware be looking

454
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,500
and be prepared and once you see some

455
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,230
pests identify them then start thinking

456
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,149
about eradication strategies I do plan

457
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,159
on giving you options for eradication

458
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,940
strategies but I'm not going to tell you

459
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,588
what to do

460
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,300
there are countless options and

461
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,220
variables when it comes to deciding your

462
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:35,289
integrated pest management but I want to

463
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,750
give you guidance to let you decide and

464
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,610
modify your own pest management system

465
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,589
to where it fits with your grouse style

466
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,810
with your grow environment and also it's

467
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:45,579
got to fit your budget so I'm gonna give

468
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,078
you a good guideline on how to take care

469
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:49,299
of pests in your garden but it is up to

470
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,448
you to implement and modify these

471
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,828
practices to work for you all right so

472
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:55,539
we've covered most of the ways that we

473
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:57,489
are going to introduce pass into it grow

474
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:58,958
let's talk about the other ways pests

475
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,909
are going to find their way into the

476
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,309
grow they're gonna come in through your

477
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:05,259
venting and your ducting if you have any

478
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,298
spots that are not sealed up a spider

479
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,650
mite or a little bug to just wiggle its

480
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:10,838
way right through there it's gonna smell

481
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,250
that sweet ganja plant it's gonna feel

482
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,168
that warmth from the light it's gonna go

483
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,459
man I want to be in there and it's gonna

484
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,990
just go that way and then it's gonna

485
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,429
tell all of its friends hey bro I found

486
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,980
a way in and they're just gonna start

487
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,230
parading in so any cracks or gaps in

488
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,779
your structure need to be sealed if you

489
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,578
can find a gap or a crack or a hole of

490
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,319
some sort put some caulk in there put

491
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:32,048
some tape over it seal it up super tight

492
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,849
so that the bugs cannot get in there now

493
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,619
it's ideal to have a completely sealed

494
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:38,349
room but I understand that that is not

495
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:40,539
always a viable option since we do have

496
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:43,159
the opportunity to get bugs in there our

497
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:45,440
next step is to have a way to monitor

498
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,720
and indicate the presence of paths and

499
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,000
the easiest way and most affordable and

500
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,430
cost-effective way to do that is first

501
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,309
by scouting you need to spend time every

502
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,070
day looking through your garden to see

503
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,309
if you see any signs of bugs or bug

504
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:03,289
damage scouting for bugs is free it just

505
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,879
takes time depending on the size of your

506
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,309
grow this could take anywhere from five

507
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,930
minutes to a full hour but it is

508
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:11,179
important work put on some good music

509
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,160
get in the zone and scout for pests

510
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,710
train everybody in the grow how to

511
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,480
identify signs of pests and also teach

512
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,880
them how to identify which pests they're

513
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,950
dealing with if you do discover pests

514
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,140
have a way to mark the plant and also

515
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,850
mark on paper where it was in the

516
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,800
facility you probably have row numbers

517
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,240
or room numbers or if it's just a home

518
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,740
grow just plant number three or the

519
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,630
plant in the middle just kind of mark

520
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,160
down roughly where it is and then start

521
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,960
thinking of a strategy if you're not the

522
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,550
one in charge of pest management make

523
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,559
sure you report that to the person above

524
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,299
you so just make a note of it write down

525
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,859
what you found what it looks like

526
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,859
what pests do you think it is and then

527
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,939
start doing research on how do we

528
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:49,069
[Music]

529
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,840
radicans so scouting for bugs is free

530
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,789
you walk the rows you turn the leaves

531
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,439
upside down you look you look low in the

532
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:56,869
canopy you look high in the canopy you

533
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,519
look around feel free to pull a few

534
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,649
leaves off if you can't get a good look

535
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,299
reach in there pop off a few leaves look

536
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,340
at those under your scope see if you see

537
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,859
anything you should be scouting for

538
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:08,569
pests on a regular basis with some sort

539
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:10,339
of a strategy now while you're out

540
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:13,429
scouting for pests you should check your

541
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:15,529
yellow sticky cards every grow should

542
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,600
have yellow sticky cards and they should

543
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:20,720
be checked frequently and changed

544
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,549
frequently as well yellow sticky cards

545
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,650
are exactly what I'm saying there are

546
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,720
little yellow cards there are about 4

547
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,880
inches by 4 inches or maybe 4 inches by

548
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,680
6 inches and they are bright yellow and

549
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,540
they are sticky they've got a disgusting

550
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,279
glue on them that if you touch it it's

551
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,839
gonna take all day to get that stuff off

552
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:37,369
of you don't get one stuck to your elbow

553
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,569
and you're working in the grow if you've

554
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:39,919
done it you know exactly what I'm

555
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:41,809
talking about when you do it you'll go

556
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,910
oh that's what he meant but you should

557
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,950
have yellow sticky traps all over the

558
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,470
grow I like to put yellow sticky traps

559
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,180
low down by the soil so that if I get

560
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,430
any soil bound pests coming up out of

561
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,170
the dirt I get indicators of that I like

562
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,900
to put yellow sticky traps low in the

563
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,880
canopy so if I get any low flying stuff

564
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,259
get indicators of that i'll put stuff at

565
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,150
the top of the canopy and then I'll also

566
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,589
put stuff up near the light so that if

567
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,840
anything flies into it I get an

568
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:08,000
indicator of that and that is a really

569
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,240
easy way to find out that you have got

570
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,650
insects bugs love those yellow sticky

571
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,170
traps they say wow look how bright that

572
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,060
is that's a leaf that is weak that's a

573
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,200
leaf that's got a weak surface that I

574
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,549
can get in there and really start

575
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,380
sucking the juice out of without a lot

576
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,119
of effort I want to go to that so the

577
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,040
bugs run to that yellow sticky trap and

578
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,169
they go oh [ __ ] this is yellow sticky

579
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,789
trap I'm stuck here and then we come in

580
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,920
in the morning and we get to find out

581
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,809
what kind of bugs were messing around in

582
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,310
the garden having a party while we were

583
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,230
at home trying to get some rest

584
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,000
yellow sticky traps are really

585
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,849
affordable and they are a really early

586
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,799
indicator of the presence of pests so

587
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:45,139
hang up your sticky traps check them on

588
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,119
a daily basis if you start seeing things

589
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,820
stuck to them investigate what that pest

590
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,919
is and tree accordingly then hang up

591
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:53,629
fresh sticky traps and see if that

592
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,550
problem has gone away or if it has

593
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,110
gotten worse or if anything new pops up

594
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,879
but if you're going to use the yellow

595
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:00,649
sticky traps there has to be some sort

596
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,510
of method to your madness you have to

597
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,370
hang them strategically you have to

598
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,140
check them and you have to replace them

599
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:08,809
and if you see something you have to

600
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,880
react accordingly so now we have two

601
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,009
methods of finding bugs in our garden we

602
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,810
can use our own vision from scouting and

603
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,390
then we can use yellow sticky traps to

604
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,710
assist us our next step is to learn to

605
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,990
use our integrated pest management

606
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,180
system to continue to prevent

607
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,150
infestations and we also need to learn

608
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,610
what to do if a pest infestation should

609
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,710
occur in a strategic pest management

610
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:33,319
system it's always wise to have

611
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,630
preventative measures in place why wait

612
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,849
until we've got bugs to start treating

613
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,460
for bugs let's make it uncomfortable and

614
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:43,069
undesirable for the pests we know may

615
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,200
arrive now before we talk about options

616
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:48,319
let's talk a little bit about ethics

617
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,750
you can choose predator bugs you can

618
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,119
choose organic sprays you can choose

619
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,569
harsh chemical sprays whatever you

620
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:00,139
choose to treat your garden is up to you

621
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:02,569
I encourage you to use something safe is

622
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,000
it safe to you is it safe to the

623
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:05,689
consumer is it safe to your pets and is

624
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,150
it overall

625
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,370
safe to our environment if you're gonna

626
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,759
smoke it yourself spray whatever you are

627
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,678
come

628
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,179
with spraying on your garden that's

629
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,009
yours you can do whatever you want I

630
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,019
probably don't want to smoke it if you

631
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,640
sprayed it with a few things but if it's

632
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,710
yours and you're sure it's not going

633
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,540
anywhere you can treat it however you

634
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,880
are comfortable if you have other

635
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,039
consumers that are going to consume your

636
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,980
product keep their health and safety in

637
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,558
mind not everybody is a young healthy

638
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,140
person some people may have underlying

639
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,418
health issues that may be exacerbated by

640
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,030
a pesticide or an essential oil or a

641
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:43,130
botanical oil keep other people in mind

642
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:45,649
if you are going to share sell or

643
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,990
dispense your product in any sort of way

644
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,730
then of course please make sure that

645
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,400
your pest management system is

646
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,558
environmentally friendly we also need to

647
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,230
keep in mind to be long-term effects of

648
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,369
whatever we choose to use beneficial

649
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,500
mites will have a long-term

650
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:02,539
environmental effect but it is a much

651
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,940
gentler effect than if we wouldn't

652
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:06,859
outside and sprayed harsh chemicals so

653
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,558
think about long-term think about

654
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:11,509
exposure not just to the plants the

655
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,819
environment the soil your neighbours

656
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,710
gardens but also to yourself you've got

657
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:18,168
to apply those chemicals or pesticides

658
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,779
or botanical oils think about if they're

659
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:22,190
going to harm you over time also think

660
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,928
about this is something we don't think

661
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,029
about often enough here but I'm trying

662
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,580
to gear myself more toward think about

663
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,798
the ethics of the company that makes the

664
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:33,019
product you were using does that company

665
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,910
care do they care about the environment

666
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,308
do they care about people do they care

667
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,350
about cannabis are they opposed to

668
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:40,789
cannabis there are some companies out

669
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,029
there that make products that are

670
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:45,859
available at the hydro store that are

671
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:48,558
completely opposed to cannabis and

672
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:50,449
cannabis legalization why would we buy

673
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,519
those products to support those people

674
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,210
so when it comes to selecting a

675
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,160
pesticide understand the company

676
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,480
understand the product you're buying

677
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,070
understand the active ingredient and

678
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,410
understand the effects of that

679
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:05,329
ingredient in the long term understand

680
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,769
what it's doing to yourself understand

681
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,750
what it's doing to your consumers and

682
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,849
try to understand what it does to the

683
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,529
environment and then really think about

684
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,029
if that's something you can support if

685
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,470
that is something you would be proud to

686
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,329
see you did if that is something you

687
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,798
would stand behind and if you're proud

688
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:20,298
of it if you can support it and you'd

689
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,740
put your signature on it go ahead and

690
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:23,539
use that product do what you're

691
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,470
comfortable with so now let's talk a

692
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,909
little bit more

693
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,829
preventive that's where I was headed

694
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,990
with all of that preventive measures

695
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:31,849
it's okay to start treating for a pest

696
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,859
problem before you see a pest problem

697
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,629
why wouldn't we go ahead and make an

698
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:38,000
undesirable environment what are easy

699
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,580
ways to do that an easy way to do that

700
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,769
is to already apply beneficial insects

701
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:45,259
why not start a colony of beneficial

702
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,450
bugs in our garden before the bad bugs

703
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:49,460
even have a chance to take hold you can

704
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,410
start getting your personal s your

705
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,880
Swarovski's whatever you decide to use

706
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,440
in there do a little bit of research

707
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,610
make sure that you order the proper bugs

708
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,110
that work for your environment your

709
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:59,089
temperature and humidity will play a

710
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,949
huge factor in the bugs that you need to

711
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:02,449
order but get some predators in there

712
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,759
get the army established and get them

713
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,220
started before the bad guys can even get

714
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:10,250
started so another route you can take is

715
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,569
by spraying pesticide applications you

716
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,940
can use your essential oils your

717
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:15,799
botanical oils or you can use your light

718
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,420
or heavy chemical sprays whatever you

719
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,059
choose to use you can start applying

720
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,670
them before you see an insect

721
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,259
infestation that way if a bug does try

722
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,820
to creep down the ducting and jumps on

723
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,410
the plant and goes on [ __ ] that I don't

724
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:29,389
want to be here at all and it just tries

725
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,430
to run it doesn't invite its friends you

726
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,920
can create that undesirable environment

727
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,110
before you even get an infestation I

728
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,240
would start with a schedule and a

729
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:40,399
strategy decide that you're going to

730
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,870
spray every so often and then decide

731
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,940
that you need to rotate your products

732
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:46,129
this frequently and then set a schedule

733
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,570
and a routine and then if you see

734
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,460
anything you can step up your game

735
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:51,589
accordingly we'll talk more about

736
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,470
scheduling and strategy a little later

737
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:56,179
now let's say we have been scouting and

738
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,059
we've been doing our preventative sprays

739
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,100
and now we have discovered some pests

740
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,750
now how do we treat them what's the

741
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:05,449
first step the first step is to

742
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,460
correctly identify your pests on a

743
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,529
commercial scale it would save a lot of

744
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,230
time and energy to treat for the correct

745
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:15,079
pests the first time so the first step

746
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,180
is to correctly identify our pests the

747
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,879
next step is to think about how do we

748
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,610
want to treat this problem do we want to

749
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,660
use predators do we want to use

750
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:25,339
horticultural oils do we want to use

751
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,080
botanical sprays do we want to get in

752
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:28,639
there with essential oils or do we want

753
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,679
to step up our game and start using

754
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,420
light pesticides or maybe even stronger

755
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,490
pesticides this is where we have to

756
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,259
think about that a lot of the essential

757
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,460
oils and the hippie products aren't

758
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,048
going to get rid of a

759
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,778
wrong infestation that's where you'll

760
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:44,599
need to step up to a mild pesticide a

761
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:46,819
lot of the pesticides are organic a lot

762
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,769
of those will work for you if you've got

763
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:50,269
a serious infestation and you don't want

764
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,009
to deal with some organic stuff you can

765
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:54,440
step your way up to more harsh chemicals

766
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,788
but like I said those are toxic and they

767
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,798
become dangerous and you need to think

768
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,929
about the ethics of what you are giving

769
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,908
to other people now if you're trying to

770
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:04,159
stay more organic if you're doing a TLO

771
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:06,770
sort of setup you can introduce predator

772
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,990
bugs perimeters are expensive you also

773
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,759
have to have specific insects to battle

774
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,319
specific insects you can't just release

775
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,000
one thing and expect it to go take care

776
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,220
of any bug that you may get

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,109
Soper dinners are an option they're also

778
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,210
time consuming you have to get out there

779
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:21,918
and let them go you have to apply and

780
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,600
they either come in sachets or they come

781
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,950
in a bottle with like a little spout you

782
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,689
got to let them out somehow they have to

783
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,960
be dispersed through the garden so they

784
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,970
are time consuming but they are organic

785
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,620
they are 100% organic you're not

786
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,269
applying anything to the garden that's

787
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,739
going to change the flavor you're not

788
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,480
putting any chemicals on there that may

789
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,970
make anybody else sick and they are

790
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,740
completely safe so you found a pest you

791
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,240
identified the pests you've done some

792
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,528
research on products that will help you

793
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,620
get rid of that pest to either

794
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:51,288
beneficial bugs or pesticide sprays and

795
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:53,778
now you've decided to apply that product

796
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:56,898
now keep in mind if we apply the same

797
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:59,869
product to a pest too many times those

798
00:27:56,898 --> 00:28:01,548
bugs will develop a resistance so you'll

799
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:03,439
see a bug you'll treat it it'll look

800
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:05,389
like it's gone it'll come back you'll

801
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,990
spray for that bug again you'll think

802
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,399
it's gone

803
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,528
couple weeks later it'll come back

804
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,148
you'll spray twice as hard it'll come

805
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:13,278
back and it won't show up for a long

806
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,778
time when it does come back you won't be

807
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,278
able to spray it down with the product

808
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:18,349
you've been using before you'll have to

809
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:21,169
switch it up so to prevent that I

810
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:23,538
recommend using multiple modes of attack

811
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,250
and don't forget that if the pesticides

812
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:27,349
work together and don't cause a chemical

813
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,298
problem together and don't disrupt the

814
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:31,278
plant health you can mix more than one

815
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:33,048
pesticide and it tank together I've done

816
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,509
an episode about it titled tank mix

817
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:37,308
don't be afraid to mix multiple products

818
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,349
together so you mix your products you

819
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:41,298
give it a good shake you apply to your

820
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:45,109
plants I would say give it two or three

821
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:47,388
days then apply a different mix then if

822
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:50,240
you still see the presence of bugs apply

823
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:51,079
a different mix don't go at it with the

824
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,819
same product

825
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,699
over and over because they will develop

826
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:57,470
a resistance to it earlier I said we

827
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,899
would talk about scheduling and strategy

828
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,778
so let's talk about a more scheduled and

829
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:05,058
detailed integrated pest management

830
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:07,308
strategy here is a quick rundown of my

831
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:09,829
scheduling and my strategy for pest

832
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:12,259
management in aggro now everything I

833
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:14,808
mentioned is approved by the Colorado

834
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:17,119
marijuana Enforcement Division and also

835
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:19,700
the Colorado Department of Ag I cannot

836
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,558
apply a pesticide that is on the banned

837
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,139
list or that has not been approved for

838
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,569
use in a commercial grow so everything

839
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:28,849
I'm using is approved by the state of

840
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:32,109
Colorado now to start my pest management

841
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:34,579
system every Monday I apply a specific

842
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:37,129
pesticide regimen to all of my

843
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:39,648
vegetative plants my small veg my large

844
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,600
veg my mother plants and the clones that

845
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:44,329
are rooted and in pots they all get

846
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,308
sprayed with a pesticide depending on

847
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:48,079
the size of the plant I may spray them

848
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:49,609
with a little more potent mix I may

849
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,558
spray them with a lighter mix i'm a

850
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:53,629
spray with just one product i'm a mix up

851
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,879
multiple products at a time but every

852
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,090
Monday those plants are getting treated

853
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,760
I also write down exactly what I sprayed

854
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:04,189
on each plant that way next week I know

855
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,379
I can switch my pesticide I can spray

856
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,169
something different next week to prevent

857
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,179
a resistance now I know that my plants

858
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:13,038
have got a protective barrier there's a

859
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:15,710
little protection going on to prevent

860
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,169
from getting pests in the room if you're

861
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,169
using lighter sprays if you're using

862
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:23,210
botanical oils or essential oils you may

863
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,070
want to up your spray regimen to twice a

864
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,200
week if those things don't stick around

865
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:30,019
very long you may want to apply them

866
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,360
more frequently so have a weekly spray

867
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:34,038
schedule in place and try to switch up

868
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,869
your products so that you can prevent

869
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:38,269
your pests from building any type of

870
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:41,119
resistance now when you're in there

871
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,099
applying the sprays spray the undersides

872
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,048
of the leaves you'll notice the spider

873
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:47,240
mites are on the underside of the leaves

874
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:49,099
why not spray there so start at the

875
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,230
bottom of the plant and start spraying

876
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:53,000
the underside of the leaf and work your

877
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,490
way up the plant to the top and you will

878
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,950
saturate the entire grow this way try to

879
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,240
cover all the plants just to the point

880
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,980
of runoff right to when they start

881
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,778
dripping specific products will have

882
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,650
specific guidelines but I recommend you

883
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,480
spray rights where they start running

884
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,180
if you just want to saturate that plant

885
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,430
don't leave any desirable space for a

886
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,799
pest so get in there and spray once

887
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:16,740
maybe twice a week and you can do this

888
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,779
throughout the vegetative stage now once

889
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,430
we start approaching the flower phase we

890
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,410
need to think about what we are going to

891
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,019
do for pest management during the bloom

892
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,330
phase and a typical commercial grow I

893
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,329
would generally apply approved

894
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:32,970
pesticides until day fourteen or fifteen

895
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:35,399
of the flowering phase I may go in there

896
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,319
the first day of the third week and hit

897
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,870
that room one last time if I've had any

898
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:42,179
problems just to make sure those bugs

899
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:43,589
aren't coming back if you don't have any

900
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,970
buds building yet if you're just

901
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,859
starting to get bud set you should be

902
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,110
okay with one final spray if you were

903
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:51,479
selective with your products now if you

904
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:53,579
haven't seen any bugs you can taper off

905
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,200
your spray applications earlier in Flour

906
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,059
and that's when we can start to

907
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,779
introduce our beneficial and predator

908
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,700
insects

909
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,889
now the beneficial insects work just

910
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,009
like pesticide applications you have to

911
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,840
reapply them at specified intervals most

912
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:09,059
of the vendors that provide live bugs

913
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,949
are willing to set you up on a scheduled

914
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:13,619
tour you will receive the same order

915
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,569
every week that way you can rely on it

916
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,889
coming it'll show up at the grow you say

917
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:18,240
hey look they're here and then you've

918
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,680
got to hang them because they're right

919
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,569
there in your face you can't forget you

920
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,070
can't put it off they're alive so that's

921
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,289
a good way to get yourself on a good

922
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:27,509
regimen and a good schedule of getting

923
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:29,399
the live bugs out so when a commercial

924
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:31,769
grow we basically work with spray

925
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,080
applications until we see bud set that's

926
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,970
when we switch to the predator bugs make

927
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,039
sure to taper off your spray application

928
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,110
tour it doesn't destroy your predator

929
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,970
bugs now if you've been releasing your

930
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,339
predators on your schedule and you start

931
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,470
seeing spider mites you can order fast

932
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,299
release predators that will get in there

933
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,460
and eat those spider mites for you they

934
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,349
come in a bottle with a little spout and

935
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,210
they are hungry you turn the spout you

936
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:56,069
open that bottle you point that bottle

937
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,180
at a leaf and the spider bite the party

938
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:59,639
termites that are in there start

939
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,070
marching out they go and destroy the

940
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,259
spider mite colonies so if you start

941
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,909
seeing an infestation during flower and

942
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:08,039
you're already putting out the bugs you

943
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,630
just need to step up the bugs and try to

944
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,119
ride it out through flower you can D

945
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,920
foliate take any spider mite infested

946
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,049
leaves out of there get them out of the

947
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,028
room don't go into a different room

948
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,950
after that don't drag the bugs

949
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,659
from the dirty room to the clean room on

950
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,278
your clothes trying to start the day

951
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,139
working in the clean room and then work

952
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,909
your way through to the dirtiest rooms

953
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:29,548
and try to work on the bug infested room

954
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,749
very last if that is an option so if

955
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:33,210
you've done everything correctly you

956
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:35,098
won't see spider mites late in Flour but

957
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,808
if you do and you were using beneficial

958
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:39,479
insects you've got the option to apply

959
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:41,398
more beneficial insects I don't

960
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:43,469
recommend spraying flowering plants with

961
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,209
anything once you have bud set

962
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:47,009
everything you spray on there you will

963
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:49,649
taste it if not in the flower you will

964
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:52,348
taste it in the concentrates so if you

965
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:54,388
do notice a presence of bugs late in

966
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:56,788
flower in your flowering room and you

967
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:58,798
were using beneficial insects as your

968
00:33:56,788 --> 00:34:00,509
pest management system or if you are

969
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,788
using sprays as your pest management

970
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:04,798
system it is time to step your game up

971
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:06,960
in your vegetative areas we need to

972
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,699
eliminate the pests in veg because if

973
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,679
you've got them in flower they are in

974
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,048
veg and we need to start getting rid of

975
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,028
them and having a clean grow before we

976
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:16,500
move stuff into the flower room because

977
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:18,539
like I've mentioned once we get past

978
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,489
week three we can't really spray those

979
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:23,399
plants we can only treat them with bugs

980
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:25,378
and that takes time to build up so let's

981
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,659
focus on getting the plants clean and

982
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:30,418
pest free before we even move them to

983
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,919
that stage a lot of people try to focus

984
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,628
on the flowering plants they want to get

985
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,239
those pest free those are on their way

986
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:37,378
out let's focus on the moms let's go all

987
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,418
the way to the beginning and get the

988
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:41,460
mother plants very clean let's get the

989
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,440
source material clean let's work on

990
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,539
keeping the clones clean let's learn how

991
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,490
to get the veg room immaculate so that

992
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,079
way when we move into the flower room we

993
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,969
don't have to battle bugs we don't have

994
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,250
to battle pests we can focus on building

995
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,648
those fat juicy buds and delicious

996
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,690
trichomes that we're all after now one

997
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:59,400
thing I do recommend is write down all

998
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,139
of your sprays if you were working in a

999
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,818
commercial grow you were required to

1000
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,009
write down all of your sprays you have

1001
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:07,318
to write down the date the time you also

1002
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,299
have to write down the name of every

1003
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:11,099
product and the EPA number of every

1004
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:12,838
product and the amount of every product

1005
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:15,450
that you applied you have to write down

1006
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,639
the REI of each product that you applied

1007
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,858
you have to write down the lot number of

1008
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,469
plants there's a lot of documenting to

1009
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:23,880
be done in a commercial grow I recommend

1010
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:26,009
you do the same thing in your private

1011
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,380
grow just for peace of mind it's always

1012
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,119
nice to have records and if you do end

1013
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,890
up working in a commercial grow you've

1014
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,289
already got experience writing

1015
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:36,028
what you've been using now I'm sure

1016
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:38,599
there are a lot of people that will not

1017
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:41,338
agree with my pesticide spray

1018
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,410
application regimen that is just fine

1019
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:45,509
with me I like the people have different

1020
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,578
opinions that's just the method that I

1021
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:49,858
use in a commercial environment it's

1022
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,660
what has been proven to work for me it

1023
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:53,038
has been proven to be cost effective and

1024
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,088
it is something that I can train other

1025
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,380
employees to do on a repeatable basis

1026
00:35:56,088 --> 00:36:00,630
just like all other aspects of growing

1027
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,759
cannabis the options for integrated pest

1028
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,318
management are endless and as long as

1029
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:06,210
it's making you happy as long as you

1030
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:06,989
were satisfied with the results keep

1031
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,028

all right podcast world that is my quick

1033
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:13,469
talk on integrated pest management I

1034
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,598
know I didn't recommend any products I

1035
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:18,268
didn't recommend any specific vendors I

1036
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,579
did not recommend any brands my goal was

1037
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:22,768
to give you an idea of how to start your

1038
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,539

1039
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:26,608
management now you know what to expect

1040
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,230
and you've got a few options on how to

1041
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:30,960
prevent and how to treat those things

1042
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,539

really like it there's a little

1078

1080

the tongue is perfect and then that head

1087
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:11,009

1088
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,190

this alright you guys let's keep moving

1093
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:24,539
this show forward because I have got a

1094
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:26,130
lot to talk about we're gonna get back

1095
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:28,500
into the grow lessons on this episode

1096
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,170
this is going to be the eighth lesson in

1097
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,239
a long series of grow lessons so far

1098
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,280
we've talked about our goals and ideas

1099
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,048
and where to set up our grow we've gone

1100
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,250
over the equipment we've talked about

1101
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,019
the lights we've talked about our

1102
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,119
containers we've talked about soil and

1103
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,798
medium we've talked about pest control

1104
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,710
and if you're not caught up I recommend

1105
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:48,329
you go back to episode 351 and start

1106
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,858
there there are a couple of

1107
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:51,568
interruptions in the lessons I will

1108
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:53,400
sneak in a few episodes that are not

1109
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:55,079
grow lessons while I'm doing this series

1110
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,970
sometimes I'll need to read emails

1111
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,829
sometimes I'll need to answer questions

1112
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:00,959
coming up we're gonna have some iTunes

1113
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:02,970
customer reviews things like that will

1114
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,380
disrupt the lessons but I think it keeps

1115
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:07,108
the show's fresh it keeps me motivated

1116
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,480
and it keeps it fun but in this episode

1117
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:11,279
we will continue the grow lessons but

1118
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,409
before we get there let's talk about a

1119
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,180
couple of things I kind of overlooked

1120
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:17,940
while we were talking about building our

1121
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:20,159
grow it might be a good idea to add a

1122
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,869
smoke detector to each grow room

1123
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,838
wherever you've got a grow light hanging

1124
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:26,930
have a smoke detector in that room also

1125
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,909
I would recommend a fire extinguisher

1126
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:31,739
outside of each grow room now I hope you

1127
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,690
don't have to use it but if that smoke

1128
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,848
alarm goes off you'd rather have that

1129
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,530
fire extinguisher outside of the grow

1130
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,329
room so you don't have to open the door

1131
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,700
run in there get the fire extinguisher

1132
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:43,530
then start working on the fire if it's

1133
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:44,818
outside of the grow room you can just

1134
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,740
grab it you can be a little more

1135
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:48,630
prepared you can get in there you can

1136
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,029
start putting out the fire also if

1137
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,380
you've never used a fire extinguisher

1138
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,630
maybe read the instructions maybe

1139
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,220
understand what to do in case of a fire

1140
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,619
maybe just read that little book that

1141
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,980
comes with it and also make sure it

1142
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,019
stays

1143
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,030
charged it's got a gauge on it it's got

1144
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:04,980
a red a yellow and a green make sure

1145
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,019
your little arrow is in the green at all

1146
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,699
times you might want to think about some

1147
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:10,679
sort of automated fire suppression

1148
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,179
system they make things that hang in the

1149
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,949
middle of the grow room it's got a

1150
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,379
little heat sensor in it if it gets too

1151
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:18,029
hot it basically explodes it releases a

1152
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,039
powder that rains down into the grow

1153
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,320
room that will put out any fire that's

1154
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,690
in the room think about some sort of way

1155
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,269
to detect and suppress a fire in your

1156
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,519
grow room should that situation occur

1157
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:31,259
another thing I overlooked when we were

1158
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,119
designing and building our room was an

1159
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,550
automated watering or an assisted

1160
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,440
watering system an automated watering

1161
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,720
system can really speed things up once

1162
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,369
you get into a larger grow it also makes

1163
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,679
the plants really happy because the

1164
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:45,358
plants love consistency if you're

1165
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,149
interested in designing an auto watering

1166
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:51,329
system I did a full episode about auto

1167
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,160
watering on episode 335 unfortunately

1168
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,599
there were some audio technical

1169
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,730
difficulties and parts of the episode

1170
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,889
chopped out if you listened to that

1171
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,289
episode and you still have specific

1172
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,759
questions send me an email I grow from

1173
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,980
your heart at hotmail.com

1174
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,500
and we will get your auto water system

1175
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,030
dialed in all right so at this point we

1176
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,849
should have goals and reasonable

1177
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,440
expectations for our grow we should have

1178
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,089
a good idea of where we want to put the

1179
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,460
grow we should have a good idea of the

1180
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,380
gear we want to buy the lights the pots

1181
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,900
the medium we should also have a good

1182
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,880
idea of pest control now we've talked a

1183
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,099
little bit about fire suppression I've

1184
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,829
also done an in-depth episode on fire

1185
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,019
suppression that is episode 260 if you

1186
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:33,779
want to learn a lot about fire safety in

1187
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:36,030
your grow episode number 260 will teach

1188
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,740
you a lot there if you decide you want

1189
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,040
to add an auto watering system to your

1190
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,868
grow episode 335 is the episode all

1191
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,329
about Auto watering so that should get

1192
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:46,769
us all caught up the room is ready we've

1193
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:48,750
got the gear planned out we've got a

1194
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:50,159
good idea of pest management we know

1195
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,869
what we're gonna feed the plants we know

1196
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,608
how to take care of a fire we know how

1197
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,590
to set up an auto watering system if we

1198
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:56,639
need one now we're getting to the fun

1199
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,700
part of this journey

1200
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,500
let's start thinking about plants what

1201
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,299
do you want to grow what do you want to

1202
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,789
dedicate your time your energy your

1203
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,420
space and a bunch of money to over the

1204
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:10,500
next 90 to 120 days what strains have

1205
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,780
gotten your attention

1206
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,880
what strains do you really enjoy smoke

1207
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,190
does something work for you medically

1208
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,630
does something work for you

1209
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,849
recreationally is there something that

1210
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,280
is reliable that every time you smoke it

1211
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:25,139
you get the desired effect this is gonna

1212
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,450
fall back to the very first episode of

1213
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:29,250
this bro lesson series are you growing

1214
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:31,079
this for yourself are you growing it for

1215
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,579
a medical patient you have a lot of

1216
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,739
things to think about when it comes to

1217
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,349
deciding what strains to grow in your

1218
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:39,299
new garden in legal medical and

1219
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:41,610
recreational states we have a lot more

1220
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,890
options for acquiring genetic material

1221
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:46,200
we can go to a dispensary and buy a

1222
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:48,000
clone off of the shelf we can go to our

1223
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,739
friends garden and ask them for clones

1224
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,199
and they can give sell or trade those

1225
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:54,509
clones to us we can acquire clones here

1226
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,519
very easily in Colorado in fact I went

1227
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,620
to a dispensary just a few days ago to

1228
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,360
pick up these fuego extracts and they

1229
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,339
had two different variety of clones on

1230
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,500
the Shelf that looked very healthy it

1231
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,360
had purple punch and dos Eidos on the

1232
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,150
shelf ready to go at a very reasonable

1233
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,420
price so clones are readily available in

1234
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:14,309
Colorado seeds are also available in

1235
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,869
some Colorado dispensaries so you can

1236
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:17,610
walk right into the store you can grab a

1237
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:19,769
pack of seeds and you can start your new

1238
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,470
garden from seeds you picked up at your

1239
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:24,539
local dispensary clones and seeds are

1240
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:26,939
both viable options for starting a

1241
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:30,090
garden this episode is going to focus on

1242
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,400
the great debate on seeds versus clones

1243
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:34,829
before we get into that let's talk a

1244
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,380
little bit about how you can decide what

1245
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:40,230
strain you want to grow the best way to

1246
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,849
do that is to smoke a bunch of different

1247
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,469
strains now if you're in a medical or

1248
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:46,259
recreational state that is a lot easier

1249
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:48,209
than if you were in Prohibition land if

1250
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,980
you're in prohibition land who knows if

1251
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,960
the strain you were buying is even

1252
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,610
really what whoever is selling it to you

1253
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,110
is called they're probably growing

1254
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,809
something and they're calling everything

1255
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,460
cookies because cookies sells anything

1256
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,170
with the letters OG at the end of it

1257
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,720
sell so you've probably got something

1258
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,610
cookies OG anything with the word fire

1259
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,980
in their works well so you probably you

1260
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:10,410
guys are probably buying fire cookies OG

1261
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,000
in Prohibition land everywhere and it's

1262
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:14,069
probably whatever that person got a

1263
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,780
clone of or whatever that person's

1264
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,700
buying bulk of and they're just renaming

1265
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,890
it because they know that names are hot

1266
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,329
so in a prohibition state it's gonna be

1267
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:22,920
a little bit harder maybe you'll get

1268
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,019
lucky maybe you'll get a seed in your

1269
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,980
bag of weed one day you can always grow

1270
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:28,380
out those bags see

1271
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,480
sometimes you find phenotypes very close

1272
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,130
to what you started with also sometimes

1273
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,809
you find hermaphrodites and problematic

1274
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,119
plants so be prepared for that as well

1275
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:38,909
but sometimes it is your only option

1276
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,920
it's always an awkward situation asking

1277
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,509
a grower for clones if you're a new

1278
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
grower and you're buying herb from

1279
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,359
somebody and you're like bro I really

1280
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,159
love this strain do you think I could

1281
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,380
get a clone that always presents an

1282
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:51,299
awkward situation first of all now you

1283
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,680
both know you're growing if you're in a

1284
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,960
prohibition state that makes things

1285
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,489
really weird for both of you also the

1286
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,019
guy doesn't want to release as genetics

1287
00:44:56,489 --> 00:45:00,149
to you because now he's going to lose a

1288
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:01,829
customer so unless you're on a really

1289
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,619
friendly basis with your weed guy I

1290
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:06,480
would avoid that conversation now in a

1291
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,400
legal state in a recreational or a

1292
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,469
medical state it's really easy to go

1293
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,780
find out what strains work best for you

1294
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:14,309
you go to the dispensary and you buy as

1295
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,170
many grams as you can afford of

1296
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:18,480
different varieties and you go home and

1297
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,519
you smoke them you start fresh every day

1298
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,500
and you try this strain I haven't smoked

1299
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,940
this one yet let's smoke strain a and

1300
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,858
you take a few notes and you see how it

1301
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,539
works for you first thing in the morning

1302
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:29,099
if you've got a target if you're trying

1303
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:30,539
to make your leg pain go away if you're

1304
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,579
trying to make your headache go away for

1305
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,960
trying to make your back pain go away if

1306
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,079
you're trying to make your anxiety go

1307
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,539
away document the level of which that

1308
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,000
ailment starts is it a five is that a

1309
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:44,550
ten okay I started off with a level five

1310
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,800
leg pain I smoked a bowl of this strain

1311
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,619
a I know my leg pain is it it to

1312
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,410
document that the next day I woke up leg

1313
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,480
pains at a five I smoked strained B now

1314
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:55,858
my leg pain is still at a five I

1315
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,780
obviously don't want to buy any more of

1316
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,059
this [ __ ] then you want to go then the

1317
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,310
next day day number three I woke up my

1318
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:04,380
leg pains at a six I smoked some of this

1319
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:05,940
now I'm at a two this one might work

1320
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,829
well for me let's put a little star by

1321
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,210
that and remember what this is and then

1322
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,829
just keep doing a little test like that

1323
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,079
on yourself and with the flowers and

1324
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:15,449
find out what strain works for you if

1325
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,909
you find a strain at one dispensary it

1326
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:20,309
works very well for you try to find it

1327
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:21,659
at another dispensary and smoke that

1328
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:23,699
product because they have different

1329
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:25,649
growers they may have different clones

1330
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:27,629
their product is gonna come out very

1331
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,820
different in the end even if we start

1332
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,769
with the same clone to commercial grows

1333
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,600
will produce two very different products

1334
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:35,340
so try them both and see if it's the

1335
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,719
strain it might have just been that one

1336
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,550
batch it might have just been that one

1337
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,169
grow but try different batches if

1338
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,760
possible I know it sounds like I'm

1339
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,550
completely spoiled but this is a real

1340
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,250
thing I can drive to ten dispensaries in

1341
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:50,289
my area and probably five of them have

1342
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,449
wedding cake and that wedding cake was

1343
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:54,699
probably grown by three different grows

1344
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:56,529
and I bet you if I try all three of them

1345
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:57,879
they're all gonna have very subtle

1346
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,650
nuances one will taste a little

1347
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,940
different one's gonna burn a little

1348
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,889
different and one's gonna have a better

1349
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,990
high but they're all gonna have that

1350
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:07,299
wedding cake droopy I giggle II kind of

1351
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:09,489
think going on so try to check them out

1352
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,380
from different grows if you can make

1353
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:13,689
sure that it's the strain and not just

1354
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,369
that one grower that did it for you now

1355
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,200
one thing I want to loop back on we

1356
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,509
talked about trying to get a clone from

1357
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,819
your grower if you do try to buy a clone

1358
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,130
from your grower friend don't be

1359
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,860
offended when he hits you with a really

1360
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,930
steep price think about this he's been

1361
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,760
selling you herb for how long and now

1362
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,440
you're gonna grow your own how much

1363
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,240
money are you taking out of his pocket I

1364
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,280
know you're gonna save that much money

1365
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,809
but that guy's been relying on you as a

1366
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,460
customer and now you're gonna try to

1367
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:41,980
grow your own he's gonna go dude this

1368
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,990
guy's gone you've got to put a fat chunk

1369
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,429
in his pocket as a parting gift when he

1370
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:46,809
gives you that clone that's why he needs

1371
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,460
so much for it also

1372
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,750
he's the only one growing that in town

1373
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,650
that's how he's living that's how he's

1374
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,360
making his income

1375
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,769
you're gonna bite into that that genetic

1376
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,570
is gonna be out there how does he know

1377
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:57,250
you're not gonna run a bunch of it and

1378
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,990
flood the town with it so when they hit

1379
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,539
you with a really high price for a clone

1380
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:03,039
in a prohibition state that's why it's

1381
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:05,500
because that's how that person is living

1382
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,570
that is his income that's his artwork

1383
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,130
he's probably Fino hunted that or he

1384
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,920
paid a whole lot of money for that clone

1385
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:14,349
himself so he's sharing his revenue

1386
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,119
stream with you and kind of opening up

1387
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,489
the floodgates to put himself out of

1388
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,019
business once you guys do a Fino hunt

1389
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:21,299
and you've found your own keeper you

1390
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:24,610
kind of understand a little bit more

1391
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,780
especially in a prohibition state all

1392
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,430
right you guys we've talked a little bit

1393
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,680
about deciding what you want to grow

1394
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:31,509
what you want to grow is up to you once

1395
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,369
you decide what you want to grow if you

1396
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,110
pick something that takes ten or twelve

1397
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,969
weeks and it grows tall and skinny if

1398
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,710
that's really what you think you want to

1399
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:41,199
grow you're gonna have to adapt to that

1400
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:44,110
plant don't try to make that plant adapt

1401
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,339
to you that is not how it works all

1402
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,200
right I've got a bunch of notes but I

1403
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,000
don't have a good segue so let's just

1404
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,699
jump right into this let's talk about

1405
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,099
the debate on seeds versus clones you've

1406
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,989
decided what you wanted

1407
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,809
now do you want to grow it from seed or

1408
00:48:54,989 --> 00:49:00,059
from clone growing from either seed or

1409
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,489
clone both have their advantages and

1410
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,889
disadvantages something you'll have to

1411
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:07,019
think about with both of them is

1412
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:09,750
availability are clones available where

1413
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:12,329
you are does somebody in your area grow

1414
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:14,639
that is willing to release clones to you

1415
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,949
for your personal production is there a

1416
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,199
dispensary in your area that sells

1417
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:21,419
clones if I read correctly

1418
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,099
in Canada you can ship clones to each

1419
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,530
other through the mail so that's an

1420
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:28,289
option but if nobody has clones near you

1421
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:30,540
they are not available now if somebody

1422
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:32,670
does have clones are they accurately

1423
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,309
labeled do they have the variety you're

1424
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,110
looking for and are they clean we'll

1425
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:39,509
talk about that in just a minute it's

1426
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:41,130
kind of the same story with seeds do you

1427
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,810
know somebody that's got seeds that is

1428
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,640
willing to share some with you and if

1429
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:46,799
you get them from somebody are they

1430
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,230
accurately labeled and do they have the

1431
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,300
variety that you're looking for one of

1432
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:53,400
the advantages of seeds is that there

1433
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,550
are shops on the internet that will send

1434
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,110
seeds directly to your mailbox if you

1435
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,539
were in a prohibition state and you

1436
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,640
order seeds from an online vendor it is

1437
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,710
your responsibility to keep those seeds

1438
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,170
in the packaging and do not allow them

1439
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,170
to grow if it is illegal to grow them in

1440
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,990
your area save them as souvenirs and

1441
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,930
collectibles until legalization happens

1442
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:18,779
in your area or until you move to a

1443
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:21,059
legalized state but there are several

1444
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,340
online vendors who will send you seeds

1445
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:25,289
to keep his collectibles if you do

1446
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,500
choose to germinate those and grow those

1447
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:29,969
yourself that is your responsibility

1448
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,730
anything that happens from that is up to

1449
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:35,909
you but seeds are available online and

1450
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:38,849
seeds don't die in the mail now I want

1451
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,799
to do a friendly debate on clone vs.

1452
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,539
seed but to keep it fair

1453
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,850
we need to act like there is a place

1454
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:47,009
where we can go that has clones and

1455
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:49,529
seeds available and just about any

1456
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,090
variety we could imagine think about the

1457
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,950
strain that you chose you want to grow

1458
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,380
for your first time let's imagine

1459
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:58,019
there's a dispensary where we can go and

1460
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,789
they've got flowers of that strain grown

1461
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:01,860
by three different growers so we can

1462
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:03,659
smoke it from three different people and

1463
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,059
make sure it's what we like they've also

1464
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:06,579
got extracts there so if you're into

1465
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,929
smoking

1466
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:10,000
concentrate they've got full-spectrum

1467
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:10,539
extract they've got shatter they've got

1468
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,010
wax

1469
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:13,509
they've got whatever you're into that

1470
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,670
way so you can make sure it's the strain

1471
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,580
you desire for your concentrates then

1472
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:21,220
also they have got seeds and clones of

1473
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:23,349
your favorite strain ready for you there

1474
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:25,839
now you've got the option do you want to

1475
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:27,549
buy seeds or clones for your grow let's

1476
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,530
start a friendly debate right here now

1477
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,870
before I get too far into this let me

1478
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,280
give a quick explanation on what a clone

1479
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,690
is I'm pretty sure most people know what

1480
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,400
a seed is that's a little beam that

1481
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,260
grows into a big plant it came out of

1482
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,960
another plant now let's talk about a

1483
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,120
clone a clone is basically a photocopy

1484
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,980
of a plant we take a cutting off of a

1485
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,230
plant and it roots and now we have a

1486
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,449
photocopy of the plant we started with

1487
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:51,699
cannabis plants are annuals which means

1488
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:54,460
they only live for one year or one cycle

1489
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:56,919
so we grow it from seed it produces bud

1490
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:59,409
we harvest it it is over by taking a

1491
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,360
clone we can have that plant again and

1492
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:03,730
again then we can have repeatable

1493
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,070
reliable outcomes and a reliable product

1494
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:08,769
from each harvest so a clone is

1495
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,630
basically a genetic photocopy of a

1496
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:12,280
reliable plant in the form of just a

1497
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,500
tiny little plant and we'll talk about

1498
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,720
clones and we'll talk about Fino hunting

1499
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,760
a lot more as these grow lessons go on

1500
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:22,419
now let's talk about some of the pros

1501
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,910
and cons of seeds and clone the pros of

1502
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,099
growing from seed one of the best parts

1503
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:30,279
about growing from seed is there are no

1504
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:32,980
bugs and no pathogens you don't get free

1505
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,140
powdery mildew with your new clone all

1506
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,539
too often people give out clones that

1507
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:40,509
are infested with spider mites with

1508
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:42,880
Russert mites with aphids with thrips or

1509
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,850
with powdery mildew that is not an

1510
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,829
option with the seed so let's also put

1511
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:49,480
that in the cons category when it comes

1512
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:51,789
to growing from clone one of the

1513
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,130
disadvantages of starting from clones is

1514
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:56,769
that they may come with bugs or

1515
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,559
pathogens now let's talk about one of my

1516
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:01,360
favorite parts about growing from seed

1517
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,820
growing from seed allows me to find

1518
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,980
custom tailored phenotypes that work

1519
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,230
perfectly for what I'm looking for

1520
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,019
medically and perfectly for what I'm

1521
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:13,300
looking for in my grow it grows the

1522
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:15,369
height I want it to grow it grows for as

1523
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,590
long as I want it to grow and it gives

1524
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:19,199
me medicine it gives me the effect that

1525
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,119
I need so draw

1526
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,699
from seed allows me to find something

1527
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,280
completely unique for myself that works

1528
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:29,819
perfectly for my garden and my medical

1529
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:32,849
needs the cons that is it does take time

1530
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,920
for a selection I have to run the batch

1531
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:36,690
of seeds I have to find the plant that

1532
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,130
works for me hopefully there was one in

1533
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,559
that batch that was exactly what I

1534
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,660
wanted if not I keep searching so that

1535
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,059
is the downside to that and we will do

1536
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:48,118
an episode on Fino hunting in the future

1537
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:50,099
that is lined up in this series so one

1538
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:52,440
of the advantages is that I can find

1539
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:54,900
perfectly custom-tailored phenotypes

1540
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,358
that work for myself and my grow the con

1541
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,730
to that is that it does take time for

1542
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,828
selection I have to run the seeds I have

1543
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,869
to grow them up I have to cut clones I

1544
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:05,400
have to flour them out I have to dry

1545
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:07,200
them cure them smoke them and see which

1546
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,630
ones I enjoyed see which ones I didn't

1547
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,129
enjoy usually when I run a ten pack I

1548
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,380
find two or three that I want to run

1549
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,930
again so I'll repeat the process and

1550
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,240
eliminate it to one but that does take

1551
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:21,809
time money and energy to get to that

1552
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,459
point also there may be males there may

1553
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:26,519
be hermaphrodites and there may be

1554
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,619
undesirable phenotypes in that test run

1555
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,269
so depending on the quality of the seeds

1556
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,789
and the experience of the breeder and

1557
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:34,889
the stability of the work I may not find

1558
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:36,929
the phenotype I'm looking for in a ten

1559
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:39,659
pack it may take more than ten seeds to

1560
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:41,818
find the desirable phenotype but if I've

1561
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:43,980
got reliable seeds and the breeder did

1562
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:46,019
his work and I've done my job properly I

1563
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,210
may find something in there that is

1564
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:51,000
amazing and I may find something in

1565
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:52,889
there that nobody else has which will

1566
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,050
set me apart from the market if I'm

1567
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:57,420
growing for a production to put on the

1568
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:59,640
street having a very unique strain would

1569
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,710
set me apart from the market if I've got

1570
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:03,179
the frosty estanque a strain on the

1571
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,010
market people are gonna want to buy that

1572
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:06,868
first which means I'm gonna make more

1573
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,940
sales which means maybe I can charge a

1574
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:11,490
little more so having that perfectly

1575
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,659
selected phenotype that grows exactly

1576
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:15,088
the way I want it to

1577
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:17,608
it grows perfectly for my grow and it

1578
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:19,679
works perfect for my area for my market

1579
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:22,289
that is a great advantage of growing

1580
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,118
from seed another advantage of growing

1581
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:26,369
from seed is that there is a huge

1582
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,410
variety available I know we talked about

1583
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:30,358
this imaginary store where everything is

1584
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:32,519
available but it's not like that in all

1585
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:35,250
places there are seed banks

1586
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:37,139
line that make many varieties of seeds

1587
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:39,719
from very many reputable breeders

1588
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:42,299
available to people all over the world

1589
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,399
so seed availability is a huge advantage

1590
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,950
not everybody can get their hands on

1591
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,289
clean reliable accurately labeled clones

1592
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:51,960
so being able to order seeds from a seed

1593
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:54,719
bank is definitely advantageous now the

1594
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,730
downside to that is seeds can be kind of

1595
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,099
expensive depending on the vendor and

1596
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,289
the breeder seeds can have a huge markup

1597
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,529
and if you're working with regular seeds

1598
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:06,090
you may lose 60% of your crop right when

1599
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,280
you switch to flour because you're going

1600
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:10,620
to have male plants to deal with so

1601
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,840
buying seeds can get expensive and you

1602
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:15,059
also need to have a reliable breeder and

1603
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,430
a reputable vendor so that you know you

1604
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:19,679
were getting what you pay for now let's

1605
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:21,509
focus more on growing from clone what

1606
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,549
are some of the advantages or pros of

1607
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,890
growing from a clone if properly

1608
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:29,430
selected that clone is a female if

1609
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:31,379
properly selected that clone is known to

1610
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:34,349
put out high potency and to grow without

1611
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,539
any issues now that being said we have

1612
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,699
to rely on a grower so that is one of

1613
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:40,920
the cons of growing from clones

1614
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:42,539
somebody has to grow the seeds and find

1615
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,269
the keeper plants out of those seed

1616
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:48,000
packages hopefully they chose the

1617
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:50,550
stellar keeper to pass on as clones to

1618
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,619
the consumers in a dispensary what

1619
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:55,350
usually happens is I'll cut a hundred

1620
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:57,000
and twenty clones for my next run I only

1621
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:59,159
need a hundred of them so I actually

1622
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,840
send those twenty to the store so that I

1623
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,250
don't have to throw them away we put

1624
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,260
them on a manifest we send them to the

1625
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,780
store and those are made available for

1626
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,670
shoppers in the retail store so if

1627
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,620
you're buying a clone from a dispensary

1628
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,809
and it's accurately labeled you're

1629
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,789
probably getting the same exact cut as

1630
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:16,889
they're growing and putting on the Shelf

1631
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:18,779
so you know that those clones have been

1632
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:21,359
properly Fino hunted you know that those

1633
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,400
clones are proven females with proven

1634
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,220
potency and have proven themselves to be

1635
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,809
resistant to bugs and pathogens so

1636
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:29,879
that's the advantage to growing from a

1637
00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:31,380
clone the disadvantage to that is who

1638
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,180
knows who selected that if you're just

1639
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,880
getting it from some dude on Craigslist

1640
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:38,759
who knows how discerning his I was maybe

1641
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,590
his idea of amazing bud and your idea of

1642
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,050
amazing bud are two completely different

1643
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:45,510
things so keep that in mind when working

1644
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,140
with a clone another advantage of

1645
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:48,299
working with

1646
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:50,429
clone is we have an idea of what to

1647
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:52,259
expect like we said before somebody Fino

1648
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:54,149
hunted this clone they've grown it out a

1649
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,859
couple of times they know that it's a

1650
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,829
female they know that it's gonna have

1651
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:01,380
high potency either high CBD high THC or

1652
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:03,809
a beautiful ratio of both we know what

1653
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,298
to expect we also have an idea of what

1654
00:58:03,809 --> 00:58:08,039
type of growth patterns to expect is it

1655
00:58:06,298 --> 00:58:10,230
gonna get real tall is it gonna get real

1656
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,630
bushy is it gonna stretch out real bad

1657
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,730
is it gonna need a lot of water we also

1658
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:16,980
have a good idea of how long it will

1659
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:18,869
take to finish because our friends and

1660
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,579
partners have probably grown this cut

1661
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:23,160
several times before they gave it to us

1662
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:25,470
so the main advantage to growing from

1663
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,759
clone is that you've got a proven female

1664
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:28,768
you don't have to worry about calling

1665
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,079
males every plant you put in there is a

1666
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:32,639
female they've been tested for potency

1667
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,980
they've been tested for vigor they've

1668
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,469
been tested for resistance we know what

1669
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,969
to expect we know if we need sticks we

1670
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:40,768
know if we need trellis we know how

1671
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:42,750
often to water it we know if we can over

1672
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:45,268
feed it we know if it likes a high or a

1673
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:47,278
low pH and we already know how many days

1674
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:49,768
to let it flower so that is a huge

1675
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:51,690
advantage from working with a clone also

1676
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:53,038
you can always call the guy and say hey

1677
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,900
bro this plant is doing something weird

1678
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,250
have you ever seen this strain do this

1679
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,838
and you'll say oh yeah man I drew that

1680
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,880
like 10 times before I gave it to you

1681
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,980
you probably just need more Cal mag so

1682
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,690
he's got some sort of history some sort

1683
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,909
of experience with it and he can help

1684
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:08,159
you diagnose a problem if one does arise

1685
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:10,500
so that's a huge advantage of working

1686
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,629
with a clone let's talk about some of

1687
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,759
the disadvantages the number one

1688
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,920
disadvantage the number one con to

1689
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:19,409
bringing clones into your garden is most

1690
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,039
of the time they are infested with bugs

1691
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:25,199
and pathogens every grower likes to say

1692
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,900
my grow is immaculate there is not a

1693
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,409
single bug in my garden nine times out

1694
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,450
of 10

1695
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:32,759
those guys are wrong the guys that boast

1696
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:34,949
most about having the pest free garden

1697
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:36,329
are the ones that don't know the pests

1698
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:38,009
are they're the guys that say no I've

1699
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:39,539
got a little bit of spider mites they're

1700
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:41,130
the guys that are paying attention that

1701
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,680
are actually checking and they know that

1702
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:46,079
those bugs are there they are there so

1703
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,328
getting a clone you're probably going to

1704
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,220
get some sort of a problem everybody

1705
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:51,778
also likes to say my buddy wouldn't give

1706
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,129
me clones with pests on them yeah he

1707
00:59:51,778 --> 00:59:54,750
doesn't even know they're there he

1708
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:56,490
didn't check he's not paying enough

1709
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,289
attention he's just trying to make five

1710
00:59:56,489 --> 01:00:00,618
dollars a clone by selling them to you

1711
00:59:58,289 --> 01:00:03,140
he didn't care if you get spider mite

1712
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:05,930
because you're gonna need more clones in

1713
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:08,269
the future either way so the downside to

1714
01:00:05,929 --> 01:00:10,730
clones is they come with free bugs quite

1715
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:12,409
often you get spider mites you get free

1716
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,969
route a feeds you get free white flies

1717
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:16,699
you get free fungus gnats and if you're

1718
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:18,909
really lucky sometimes you even get free

1719
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:21,500
powdery mildew with your new clones

1720
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:24,409
another disadvantage to growing from

1721
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,670
clone is everybody already has it if

1722
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:27,649
you're just growing this strain for

1723
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:29,358
yourself for your medical needs or for a

1724
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:31,400
loved ones medical needs and that strain

1725
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,559
works perfectly for you that is great

1726
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,079
but if you were growing for a market

1727
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:37,639
reason and everybody has that strain

1728
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,039
you're going to have to be a better

1729
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:41,960
grower than everybody else growing it to

1730
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,029
make your product stand out otherwise

1731
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,530
you're just another guy selling weed on

1732
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:48,350
the black market if you don't have a

1733
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:49,910
standout strain you will blend in just

1734
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:51,380
like everybody else so if you're growing

1735
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:53,509
the same clone that all of your

1736
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:56,059
competition is growing you've really got

1737
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,770
to be the best grower so that's one of

1738
01:00:56,059 --> 01:01:00,019
the downsides to growing from clone is

1739
01:00:57,769 --> 01:01:01,820
everybody's got it and you guys that's

1740
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:03,469
why some growers are tight with their

1741
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,050
genetics that's why some guys won't let

1742
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:07,939
clones out because they're the only one

1743
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:10,310
growing that specific strain in that

1744
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,559
area if you want that you've got to go

1745
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:14,960
to them they've always got some income

1746
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,639
because their product stands out now

1747
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,480
another downside to working with clones

1748
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:22,039
is they can get expensive and something

1749
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,139
in me says that you get what you pay for

1750
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:25,670
when it comes to clones if you're going

1751
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:27,739
to Craigslist and paying three to five

1752
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:29,750
dollars for a clone you're going to get

1753
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,549
a three to five dollar clone it may be

1754
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,469
quality genetics it may be what you're

1755
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:35,600
looking for but how healthy is it how

1756
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:38,239
good of a start did it get how many bugs

1757
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,739
does it have clones can get expensive

1758
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:43,129
the clones that I saw at the dispensary

1759
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:44,719
recently or in 4x4 cubes of cocoa the

1760
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,230
clones were about six or eight inches

1761
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:47,480
tall

1762
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,608
they looked super healthy they were 40

1763
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,320
dollars if you're trying to buy six of

1764
01:01:49,608 --> 01:01:53,779
those that's gonna add up really quickly

1765
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,550
can you throw down two hundred and forty

1766
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,100
dollars every time you want to start a

1767
01:01:55,550 --> 01:02:00,619
fresh grow a package of seeds is way

1768
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:02,059
cheaper than that but you have to do the

1769
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:03,470
work you have to grow them you have to

1770
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:05,539
find the males and you have to find the

1771
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:07,399
keeper the advantage with clone is

1772
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:09,739
somebody has already done all of that

1773
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,280
work for you so they can charge you 40

1774
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:12,469
bucks

1775
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,640
so one of the disadvantages to growing

1776
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:16,368
from clone as

1777
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:18,199
they are expensive unless you're getting

1778
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:20,539
them from a friend they can add up and

1779
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:22,669
cost quite quickly you guys I've seen

1780
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:23,239
clones go from anywhere from five or ten

1781
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,249
bucks

1782
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,230
I saw those clones at the dispensary the

1783
01:02:25,248 --> 01:02:30,439
other day they had a purple punch and a

1784
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:32,690
doe see does there were $40 each it is

1785
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,630
not uncommon for me to see a clone sell

1786
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,818
for the 500 to $1,000 range and there

1787
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:40,278
are stories of certain cuts being sold

1788
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:42,440
for ten to twenty five thousand dollars

1789
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:44,329
depending on what strain we're talking

1790
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,278
about there are rumors of astronomical

1791
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:47,809
numbers but I don't know how much of

1792
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:50,088
that is true but some of the people in

1793
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:51,680
the Bay have paid ridiculous prices for

1794
01:02:50,088 --> 01:02:53,480
some of the og cush a--'s and some of

1795
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,879
the more well-known strains that the

1796
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,130
rapper's rap about some of the og cush

1797
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,690
and cookie crosses went for big money

1798
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,849
when they first hit the market and

1799
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:04,999
people have built entire empires and

1800
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:06,950
businesses off of those cuts so clones

1801
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:09,679
can get quite expensive quite quickly

1802
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:12,230
another disadvantage to clones is are

1803
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,358
they available does anybody in your area

1804
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,219
have clones does anybody you trust have

1805
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:18,920
clones available and if you do get

1806
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:21,409
clones are they accurately labeled ask

1807
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,930
your friends what clones they have don't

1808
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:25,940
ask for a specific strain because if you

1809
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:27,828
ask for wedding cake now your friends

1810
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,960
suddenly has wedding cake and he needs

1811
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:31,849
big money for it if you ask what strains

1812
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,980
he's got available he'll give you a list

1813
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:36,140
select from there don't give them the

1814
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,880
option to invent a name or slap a label

1815
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:39,650
on something just because you're willing

1816
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,619
to throw some money their direction for

1817
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:45,259
that cut so that is my quick debate on

1818
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:47,269
seed versus clone we'll go over really

1819
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:50,028
quickly again and recap the pros of

1820
01:03:47,268 --> 01:03:51,498
growing from seed no bugs no pests no

1821
01:03:50,028 --> 01:03:53,150
problems you don't start off with

1822
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:55,248
somebody else's problems in your grow

1823
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:57,619
another advantage is that you can select

1824
01:03:55,248 --> 01:04:00,828
perfectly selected phenotypes that work

1825
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:03,079
for you and your grow also nobody else

1826
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:06,470
is going to have your phenotype which

1827
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:08,509
will give you better market value some

1828
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:11,419
of the cons of growing from seed is that

1829
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:12,980
it takes time for selection you have to

1830
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:15,139
grow them and find out what you've got

1831
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,900
and select a keeper and then grow from

1832
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:20,929
there you will also need to call males

1833
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:23,630
and undesirable phenotypes they're also

1834
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:25,818
a little bit expensive also is the

1835
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,559
strain you want available in seed form

1836
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:29,329
some of the older stuff

1837
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,009
may not be available anymore because

1838
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:33,170
breeders are always evolving and

1839
01:04:31,009 --> 01:04:34,759
creating new stock another thing you

1840
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,979
have to think about is are the seeds

1841
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:39,079
accurately labeled are you being sold

1842
01:04:36,978 --> 01:04:41,088
what you're paying for now let's talk

1843
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:43,939
about clones really quickly again the

1844
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:45,409
pros you have got proven potent females

1845
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:46,670
you know what you've got you know what

1846
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:49,429
you're working with you know what to

1847
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:51,318
expect you know what to plan for some of

1848
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:53,268
the downsides to working with clones are

1849
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:55,670
you get those bugs you get those

1850
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:58,098
pathogens you get free problems also

1851
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:59,539
everybody else in the area has everybody

1852
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:00,798
else is already growing it there's

1853
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:03,170
nothing different there's nothing

1854
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:06,438
exciting about it unless it's custom for

1855
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:08,298
you also our clones available can you

1856
01:05:06,438 --> 01:05:10,038
even get clones do you trust the people

1857
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:12,650
you have to deal with to get them and

1858
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,778
are they accurately labeled when you do

1859
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:17,630
get them that is my quick friendly

1860
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:19,458
unbiased debate on seeds versus clones

1861
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:21,108
of course being a breeder I want you to

1862
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:24,318
buy seeds and I want you to buy them at

1863
01:05:21,108 --> 01:05:25,969
dank seed dot store then I want you to

1864
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,438
do a Fino hunt and find the one that

1865
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:29,358
works best for you we will talk about

1866
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:31,248
phenyl hunting in the future we will

1867
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,018
also talk about cutting our own clones

1868
01:05:31,248 --> 01:05:35,178
in the future that way once you've

1869
01:05:33,018 --> 01:05:37,038
acquired clones or seeds you can do a

1870
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:38,838
phenol hunt you can select the keeper

1871
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,819
then we can cut clones off of that

1872
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:43,130
keeper and we can be self-sustainable

1873
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:45,228
and not have to acquire genetic material

1874
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:47,298
from other sources unless we decide to

1875
01:05:45,228 --> 01:05:48,828
add something new to the grow so we'll

1876
01:05:47,298 --> 01:05:50,358
talk about phenol hunting we'll talk

1877
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:52,910
about cloning we'll talk about mother

1878
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:55,998
plants I have done a long episode about

1879
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:57,318
what to expect from a seed pack I think

1880
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,268
that would make great supplemental

1881
01:05:57,318 --> 01:06:00,949

them at dank seed dot store I like to

1922
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,440
start these shows off by letting you

1923
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,929
know what I'm smoking today I've been

1924
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,510
taking dad's of orange skittles ambrosia

1925
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:41,338
from apothecary farms I really like this

1926
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,930
as my morning smoke I'm recording

1927
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:45,058
earlier in the morning than I usually do

1928
01:07:42,929 --> 01:07:47,219
and this orange skittles has that orange

1929
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,960
juice orange candy sort of a taste it's

1930
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,328
also got my head going pretty quickly so

1931
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,670
it's a great way to start the day I'm

1932
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:55,829
smoking the orange skittles Fambrough

1933
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,329
juh from apothecary farms the only

1934
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:59,579
difference between the ambrosia and the

1935
01:07:57,329 --> 01:08:01,318
fan Broza is the ambrosia is a 1 gram

1936
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,910
jar when they put it in the 4 gram jar

1937
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:04,920
that's when they call it the fam

1938
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:06,239
brochure that's for the fam so the

1939
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,130
orange skittles fam Broza

1940
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,818
the potency says seventy three point

1941
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:15,480
seven percent THC zero CBD total

1942
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:17,219
cannabinoids 84.6% it's a great way to

1943
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,259
start the day it's got an uplifting head

1944
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:21,149
high it's got that amazing orange candy

1945
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:22,859
flavor to it and it's got me nice and

1946
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:25,619
talkative and energized so this should

1947
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,020
be a good podcast this is going to be

1948
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:30,659
another grow lesson in the last lesson I

1949
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,799
talked about clones versus seeds now in

1950
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:34,738
this episode we're gonna talk about

1951
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:37,048
regular seeds feminized seeds and auto

1952
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:38,879
flower seeds before we get into the seed

1953
01:08:37,048 --> 01:08:41,130
talk I want to give a few shoutouts to a

1954

all right podcast world this episode is

1970
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,500
going to be about regular seed feminized

1971
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:22,719
seed and Otto flower seed and deciding

1972
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,908
what will be best for you and your new

1973
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,980
garden a lot of people out there will

1974
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:28,689
have an opinion about feminized seeds a

1975
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:30,788
lot of people out there will have an

1976
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:33,068
opinion about Otto flower seeds

1977
01:09:30,788 --> 01:09:35,559
don't let anybody stop you from growing

1978
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:37,989
what makes you happy there's a reason

1979
01:09:35,559 --> 01:09:39,909
why regular seeds exist there's a reason

1980
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:42,638
why feminized seeds exist there is a

1981
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:45,250
reason why Otto flower seeds exists

1982
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:47,409
there are applications for all of those

1983
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:49,389
types of seeds do what you love and

1984
01:09:47,408 --> 01:09:52,028
don't let anybody out there stop you

1985
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:54,340
from growing from your heart when we are

1986
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:56,590
shopping for seeds we are thrown a lot

1987
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:59,159
of information some of it is very useful

1988
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:01,690
some of it is just fluff for advertising

1989
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:03,670
somewhere in that information we should

1990
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:06,609
be able to tell if the seeds we are

1991
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:09,250
shopping for our regular feminized or

1992
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:11,710
autoflowering that should be clearly

1993
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:13,658
noted somewhere in the description if I

1994
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:16,059
don't see any sort of notation I

1995
01:10:13,658 --> 01:10:17,888
generally assume they are regular seeds

1996
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:19,929
now that's a really good place to start

1997
01:10:17,889 --> 01:10:21,868
what do I mean by regular seed by

1998
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:23,980
regular seed I mean they were produced

1999
01:10:21,868 --> 01:10:26,529
conventionally they were made with a

2000
01:10:23,979 --> 01:10:28,779
male plant and a female plant so in that

2001
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:31,630
package of seeds you will find males and

2002
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:34,630
females they are also not Otto flower

2003
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:36,460
which means they are photo period now

2004
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:39,219
let's talk briefly about photo period

2005
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:41,770
photo period means that a plant is

2006
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:43,960
triggered into its flowering stage by a

2007
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:46,719
light cycle in nature

2008
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:49,779
this light cycle is mostly dictated by

2009
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:52,448
your location in relation to the equator

2010
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:54,099
are you right on the equator are you far

2011
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,578
north or are you far south of the

2012
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:57,069
Equator

2013
01:10:54,578 --> 01:10:59,649
now as the seasons change as fall rolls

2014
01:10:57,069 --> 01:11:02,500
around regions on the equator will start

2015
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:05,049
experiencing longer nights and shorter

2016
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,788
days those longer nights and shorter

2017
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,469
days tell our plant Hey

2018
01:11:06,788 --> 01:11:08,949
winter is coming you need to start

2019
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:10,539
producing

2020
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:12,550
your flowers so that you can reproduce

2021
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:14,529
before the end of the season and that

2022
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:17,380
triggers the plant to go into flowering

2023
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:20,229
that is its photo period indoors most

2024
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:23,440
cannabis plants require about a 12 hour

2025
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:25,179
dark period to induce flower outdoors

2026
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,949
can be different because the Sun puts

2027
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,659
off different spectrums they trigger the

2028
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,130
plants to go to sleep as the Sun sets it

2029
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,420
puts off a red spectrum that tells that

2030
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:33,400
plant hey it's nighttime and then it

2031
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,899
starts going to sleep as the Sun rises

2032
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:36,519
it puts off a blue spectrum that tells

2033
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:38,920
the plant it's time to wake up so you

2034
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,190
don't need the 1212 outdoors you can

2035
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,470
work closer to a 14-hour day and more of

2036
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:46,149
a 10 hour night outdoors because the Sun

2037
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:48,610
tells the plants to go to sleep but that

2038
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:50,589
is photo period the plants work off the

2039
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:52,569
light cycle and the light cycle works

2040
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:55,000
with nature outdoors indoors we're

2041
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:57,219
controlling that with a timer so that is

2042
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,350
basically photo period if your seeds are

2043
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,930
marked regular seeds or if it says photo

2044
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:03,850
on the package that indicates that those

2045
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:06,159
plants will be triggered to flower by

2046
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:09,160
reducing your light schedule to 12 hours

2047
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:11,079
on and 12 hours off now regular seeds

2048
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:13,869
also indicates that there will be males

2049
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:15,430
and females in that package of seeds if

2050
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:17,109
you're trying to grow a seedless crop

2051
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,880
you will have to pay attention and keep

2052
01:12:17,109 --> 01:12:21,189
the males out of the flowering room

2053
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,600
somewhere between 7 and 10 days those

2054
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:24,009
plants will start showing their sex

2055
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,320
you'll have to go through and pull out

2056
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:28,390
all of the males if you leave one male

2057
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,369
plant in there for too long it will

2058
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:33,190
pollinate and all of the plants around

2059
01:12:30,369 --> 01:12:34,989
it will be seated and depending on how

2060
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:36,789
long you let that male go and how much

2061
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:38,439
pollen he released and how much wind

2062
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:40,869
flow and how much movement you have in

2063
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:43,659
that grow you may see the entire crop

2064
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:46,119
with just one male so that is basically

2065
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:48,309
regular seed they are regular seed they

2066
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:50,529
were bred conventionally traditionally

2067
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:52,510
with a male and a female plant they are

2068
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:54,159
photosensitive which means they will

2069
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:56,500
trigger into flower by reducing the

2070
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,989
lights to approximately 12 hours on at

2071
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,880
12 hours off some plants will work one

2072
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:02,800
hour either direction you could go 13

2073
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,319
hours on you could go 13 hours off you

2074
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,289
could play with that but we recommend 12

2075
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:10,750
12 is the critical period also you will

2076
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:13,119
find males and females in your regular

2077
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,890
seeds if you're not looking to do any

2078
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,140
breeding if you want to grow seedless

2079
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:19,720
cannabis you do need to call those males

2080
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:22,539
so that's the only major downfall of

2081
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,730
regular seeds when you buy a package of

2082
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:27,130
regular seeds you've got about a 50-50

2083
01:13:24,729 --> 01:13:28,809
chance of getting males and females it's

2084
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:31,180
hard to dictate what you get with

2085
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:33,039
regular seeds now a lot of people don't

2086
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,409
want to waste the energy the time the

2087
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,420
space or the money buying and growing

2088
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:39,369
seeds that could possibly be males and

2089
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:41,680
need to be removed from the garden now

2090
01:13:39,369 --> 01:13:44,199
that is where feminized seeds come into

2091
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,460
play a lot of people have hatred toward

2092
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:47,949
feminized seeds because they are

2093
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,960
misinformed a lot of people have hatred

2094
01:13:47,949 --> 01:13:52,479
or a bias against feminized seeds

2095
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,039
because there were a few breeders back

2096
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,439
in the day that put out a batch of

2097
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:58,090
feminized seeds newer total [ __ ] and a

2098
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:59,439
few people bought those and it put a bad

2099
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:00,970
taste in their mouth and those people

2100
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,009
spread that taste throughout the

2101
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:04,780
internet and I understand when you get a

2102
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:07,659
terrible product you want to tell people

2103
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:09,250
people believe you I get that but that

2104
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:11,409
was way back in the day we have come a

2105
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:13,659
long way since then we understand how to

2106
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:15,880
produce feminized seeds on a commercial

2107
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:17,559
scale and there are a lot of breeders

2108
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:21,010
and producers out there putting out

2109
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,230
reliable quality feminized seeds when

2110
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:27,250
they are made properly feminized seeds

2111
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:29,889
will produce plants they give you 99.9

2112
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,920
percent females this is nature and

2113
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:34,480
science together so there will be

2114
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,609
anomalies you will find things that

2115
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,559
don't fall into the chart that we drew

2116
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:41,979
because that's how nature works that's

2117
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,320
why we say 99.9 percent if I do my job

2118
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:48,729
correctly when I produce feminized seeds

2119
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:50,829
you will get 99.9 percent female plants

2120
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:53,439
I'll give you a brief explanation on how

2121
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:56,050
I make feminized seeds and how a lot of

2122
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:58,960
the leading feminized seed producers

2123
01:14:56,050 --> 01:15:01,480
make their products I create a solution

2124
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,039
of silver thiosulfate that is really

2125
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:04,359
easy to learn how to do all the

2126
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,130
instructions for that are readily

2127
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:08,409
available on the internet you can make a

2128
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:10,090
silver thiosulfate solution from

2129
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:12,670
products that are easily attainable on

2130
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:15,220
the internet for less than $30 get these

2131
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,750
products I use product number one and

2132
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,610
product number two I mix them into water

2133
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,960
then I mix the two things of water

2134
01:15:18,609 --> 01:15:22,929
together now I've got my silver

2135
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,689
thiosulfate concentration i dilute that

2136
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:28,240
each plant that I'm using requires a

2137
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:30,069
different dilution and application rate

2138
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,409
there is a standard that I start with

2139
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:36,319
the basic dilution that I recommend to

2140
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:38,210
start with would be a 1 to 9 ratio

2141
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,670
silver thiosulfate to water so you've

2142
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:42,889
got nine parts water one part of the

2143
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,429
silver thiosulfate concentrate mixed

2144
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:45,230
into there

2145
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:47,539
shake that up real well and apply that

2146
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:50,029
to the plant on the first day of flower

2147
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:52,010
and then apply it every three days for

2148
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:54,500
21 days so you're going to give the

2149
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:57,260
plant seven full applications and spray

2150
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:59,179
it until it drips and get the stalks

2151
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:01,310
don't just get the leaves get in there

2152
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,690
and spray the stalks and be careful when

2153
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:05,090
you're using the silver thiosulfate

2154
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:06,888
spray because it may turn some things

2155
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:08,810
purple if you've got a white wall

2156
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:09,949
depending on which are up against

2157
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,400
whatever that hits it could turn it

2158
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:12,799
purple

2159
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,328
including your skin so be careful wear

2160
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,010
gloves wear a mask when working with the

2161
01:16:14,328 --> 01:16:18,559
silver thiosulfate solution that is

2162
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:20,239
always my recommendation so I take the

2163
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,060
silver thiosulfate solution that I have

2164
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:25,218
created then I apply it I mix it at a

2165
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:27,260
dilution of nine to one nine parts

2166
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:29,960
distilled water one part silver

2167
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,969
thiosulfate concentrate then I apply it

2168
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,649
to the plants every three days for 21

2169
01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:37,130
days it gets twenty-one applications

2170
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:39,049
then usually around day twenty five to

2171
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:40,849
thirty it starts putting out pollen

2172
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:42,440
that's when I start collecting the pall

2173
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:44,060
and I put something usually a piece of

2174
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:45,109
glass just depends on where I am and

2175
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,060
what I'm working with and put a piece of

2176
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:48,618
glass near the plant collects and pollen

2177
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,150
as it naturally falls out pick the male

2178
01:16:48,618 --> 01:16:52,250
flowers out of there gather that let it

2179
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:53,750
dry then when it really starts getting

2180
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:55,039
dumping that's what I'll move it right

2181
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,359
over by the girls and give it a good

2182
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,300
shake and now we have just made

2183
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:01,069
feminized seeds I've still got six or

2184
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,960
seven weeks of nourishing those seeds

2185
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:05,179
but if I have done everything carefully

2186
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,639
and done everything correctly I have

2187
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:09,260
created feminized seeds and there should

2188
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:11,900
be no reason why those should be

2189
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:13,460
problematic unless I completely screw up

2190
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:15,170
the next six or seven weeks which is

2191
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,939
very unlikely because all I've got to do

2192
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,618
is make sure the equipment functions

2193
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:20,569
make sure everything stays on a 12-2 op

2194
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:21,738
cycle I've got to feed it properly I

2195
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,969
know how to feed plants that are

2196
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:25,789
pregnant I know how to produce quality

2197
01:17:22,969 --> 01:17:27,980
seeds I've got a defoliant and I've also

2198
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:29,599
got to make sure to keep everything pest

2199
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:31,428
and problem free and I'm quite

2200
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:33,650
experienced at all that so far so there

2201
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:35,899
should be no problem I also make sure to

2202
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,908
thoroughly test run every batch of seeds

2203
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:39,348
I make before they make it to market I

2204
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:40,969
grow some out myself

2205
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,349
I give up bunch out to my friends I'm

2206
01:17:40,969 --> 01:17:43,670
sure you guys see on Instagram people

2207
01:17:42,349 --> 01:17:45,349
have the new stuff you're like how did

2208
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:47,328
they get that it's because they grew

2209
01:17:45,349 --> 01:17:49,219
something of mine I was impressed by it

2210
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:49,549
I reached out to them and I said hey you

2211
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:50,960
want to

2212
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:53,180
my next batch I need you to take good

2213
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,680
notes take good photos send it all back

2214
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,780
to me and then I'll know if I want to

2215
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,850
release that line or not so I have other

2216
01:17:56,779 --> 01:18:00,649
people grow it I grow it myself we test

2217
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:02,360
it before it's put out to market that

2218
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:04,699
way I know that you're receiving a

2219
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:05,899
quality product I'm gonna go off way on

2220
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:08,300
a side right here that's not even

2221
01:18:05,899 --> 01:18:09,889
written down when I make a new strain so

2222
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,440
let's just say I just pulled some seeds

2223
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:14,000
out of a plant last night that's a brand

2224
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:15,229
new cross nobody's ever seen it I've

2225
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,569
never seen it I don't know what it's

2226
01:18:15,229 --> 01:18:19,549
gonna do before those seeds go anywhere

2227
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:21,619
I'm going to throw a handful of them in

2228
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:23,630
a paper towel and germinate them and

2229
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:25,729
then in 24 hours I'm gonna pop it open

2230
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,470
and I'm gonna see how many have sprouted

2231
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:29,750
tails and I'm gonna make a note and I'm

2232
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:31,789
gonna write down the ratio however out

2233
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:34,220
of a hundred they sprouted tails or they

2234
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:35,989
did not sprout tails then I'll close it

2235
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:38,180
back up and I'll let the other ones keep

2236
01:18:35,989 --> 01:18:40,189
going or I'll see in 36 hours how many

2237
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,990
made tails and I'll take good notes then

2238
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:43,579
I'll put some of those the ones that did

2239
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:45,409
sprout tails and look good I'm gonna put

2240
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:46,579
those into some cups of dirt and I'm

2241
01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:48,079
gonna grow them and I'm gonna pay

2242
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:49,699
attention to them and I'm gonna keep a

2243
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:51,649
lot of notes I'm gonna veg them I'm

2244
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:54,109
gonna flour them I'm gonna grow them I'm

2245
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:55,699
gonna dry them cure them smoke them make

2246
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:59,029
concentrates out of them smoke the

2247
01:18:55,699 --> 01:19:01,220
concentrates we're at least 120 days

2248
01:18:59,029 --> 01:19:03,710
from even knowing what that product

2249
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,900
tastes like probably closer to 150 with

2250
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:08,029
the dry and cure phase in there then

2251
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:10,159
that is my first grow with it if I

2252
01:19:08,029 --> 01:19:12,139
approve then I'll pass some seeds on to

2253
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,119
grim if grim Bowl grows it and it looks

2254
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,280
good in his garden I'll spread it out to

2255
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:18,739
a few more people if they grow it well

2256
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:21,259
that's when I'll let it go to a vendor

2257
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:23,179
or for retail but I test the [ __ ] out of

2258
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:25,010
my feminized seeds and my regular seats

2259
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:27,260
so I stand behind my product and

2260
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,670
honestly every feminized seed that I

2261
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,739
produce sells

2262
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:32,960
I can't keep feminized seeds in stock

2263
01:19:30,739 --> 01:19:35,090
and I don't get any complaints on my

2264
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,980
feminized seed products so that's how

2265
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:39,170
things are made that's how I make my fam

2266
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:41,659
the advantage to feminized seeds is

2267
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:43,190
there are no males to remove from the

2268
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:45,619
garden you know that every seed you

2269
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:46,939
plant will result in a harvested crop

2270
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:48,739
you won't have to grow it long enough to

2271
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:51,109
sex it you won't be wasting any time

2272
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:53,179
that's advantageous for people who live

2273
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:55,699
in medical states or anybody who is

2274
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,590
limited by a plant count so your

2275
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:59,809
feminized seeds are all going to be

2276
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:01,970
females that you would say why would

2277
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:03,170
people grow photoperiod seeds when they

2278
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,760
can grow them and I see

2279
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:07,609
and guarantee that everything they grow

2280
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:10,070
makes it to harvest like I said a lot of

2281
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:13,460
people have a bias against feminized

2282
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:16,130
seeds also a lot of people like myself

2283
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:18,260
like finding the males breeding with

2284
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:20,600
females and reversed females and alpha

2285
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:23,239
females is a great practice but I like

2286
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,100
working with a solid male plant I've got

2287
01:20:23,238 --> 01:20:27,529
a passion for conventional breeding I do

2288
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,780
make feminized seeds but I have more fun

2289
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:31,130
with conventional breeding another thing

2290
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:33,409
you may notice when you're shopping for

2291
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:35,960
seeds is that feminized seeds are about

2292
01:20:33,409 --> 01:20:38,090
twice the price of regular seeds so yes

2293
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,369
you do get viable females that you can

2294
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:42,770
take to harvest but that pack of seeds

2295
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:44,238
cost exactly twice is what a regular

2296
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,560
pack of seeds cost although you didn't

2297
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,809
have to waste the time the space the

2298
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,640
soil the energy and you didn't have to

2299
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:51,739
have that extra plant count to add to

2300
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:54,199
your numbers in your legal garden so if

2301
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:57,229
the packaging says feminized seeds that

2302
01:20:54,198 --> 01:20:58,849
means that 99.9 percent of the plants

2303
01:20:57,229 --> 01:21:01,428
that come out of that seed package will

2304
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:03,050
be females now here's something that is

2305
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:04,789
kind of a side rant that I was talking

2306
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:06,500
to somebody on social media about that I

2307
01:21:04,789 --> 01:21:08,929
want to include in a podcast I'm just

2308
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,670
gonna give it a couple of seconds we

2309
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:13,880
talked about the flip when we flipped a

2310
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:16,250
flower feminized and regular photo

2311
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,260
period seeds we flip them to flower by

2312
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:21,500
changing the light cycle either from 24

2313
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:23,060
on and 0 off to 18 on and 6 off or

2314
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,369
however you've got your light cycle set

2315
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:27,410
up then you switch to 12 on and 12 off

2316
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:30,649
you are now in flower or if you're gonna

2317
01:21:27,409 --> 01:21:32,359
follow the DJ short plan you go 11 on 13

2318
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:36,139
off that's a whole other podcast

2319
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:38,359
anyway we flipped a flower that is day

2320
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:39,980
one of flower your seed package will

2321
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:42,859
give you an estimate of how long they

2322
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:45,229
need to flower nine to 10 weeks 60 to 70

2323
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:48,559
days whatever it says the day you

2324
01:21:45,229 --> 01:21:50,389
initiated that flip is day one not the

2325
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,100
day you see bud set not the day you

2326
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:54,199
smell something not the day the

2327
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:56,480
butterflies flew in and did their magic

2328
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:58,460
dance the day you change that timer is

2329
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,559
day one of flower that's how you keep

2330
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,869
track of that that's what we're talking

2331
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,239
about when we indicated that on the seed

2332
01:22:02,869 --> 01:22:06,529
package just wanted to add that side

2333
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:08,629
note I'm not sure if that was even

2334
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:10,729
relevant but there you go a little bonus

2335
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:12,140
nugget for your brain all right now

2336
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:14,479
let's work into autoflowering seeds

2337
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:16,820
let's talk about otto flowers what do i

2338
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,219
mean by an autoflowering seed earlier

2339
01:22:16,819 --> 01:22:22,159
I was talking about your location in

2340
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:24,140
relation to the equator most of us live

2341
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:26,180
in an area where we see seasonal changes

2342
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:28,760
and we also see changes in day and night

2343
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:30,710
time but keep in mind there are parts of

2344
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,440
Russia and Alaska that will receive

2345
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:36,199
extreme stretches of daylight and night

2346
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:37,879
time without interruption there are some

2347
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:41,569
points in Alaska when they will have

2348
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:45,369
full sunlight for 80 days in a row they

2349
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:47,840
will not get a night for 80 solid days

2350
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:50,300
cannabis is an extraordinary plant and

2351
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,489
it has evolved the cannabis that we are

2352
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,980
familiar with which is evolved from

2353
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:57,679
these extreme conditions with no dark is

2354
01:22:54,979 --> 01:23:00,619
known as ruderalis these ruderalis

2355
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:02,780
plants have evolved to flower without

2356
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:04,729
any dark period after so many

2357
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:06,800
generations they went hey it doesn't get

2358
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:09,139
dark we need to do something about this

2359
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,260
so through evolution they started to

2360
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:14,360
flower without a dark period a lot of

2361
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:17,239
those ruderalis plants have no desirable

2362
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:20,299
effect when smoked but they have a lot

2363
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:22,219
of desirable traits when grown some of

2364
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,650
them stay short they stay squat they

2365
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:26,240
push out really nicely and you don't

2366
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:28,879
have to change the light cycle to

2367
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:30,920
convince them to flower for you so

2368
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,989
cannabis breeders got a hold of

2369
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,180
ruderalis plants and they bred them

2370
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:38,090
together they bred our autoflowering

2371
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:40,220
ruderalis to our high potency cannabis

2372
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:42,800
plants and the offspring resulted in

2373
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:44,960
high potency autoflowering cannabis

2374
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,239
plants most of the autoflowering seeds

2375
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,369
available for most breeders now are

2376
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,920
feminized so you'll get autoflowering

2377
01:23:49,369 --> 01:23:53,510
seeds that are all girls which is really

2378
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,380
advantageous and we'll talk about that

2379
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,730
in just a minute

2380
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:57,949
I should warn you that when you're

2381
01:23:55,729 --> 01:24:00,019
looking at seeds and you see feminized

2382
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:02,510
seeds on there also look to see if they

2383
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:04,190
say photo period or Auto flower on there

2384
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,960
make sure they indicate that if they

2385
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:08,329
don't there are probably photo period

2386
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,829
all of the auto flower guys like to let

2387
01:24:08,329 --> 01:24:11,750
you know that you're working with Auto

2388
01:24:09,829 --> 01:24:13,760
flowers they clearly indicate that on

2389
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,890
the package and earlier I mentioned that

2390
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,619
feminized seeds cost twice as much as

2391
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:21,079
regular Auto flowers generally cost

2392
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:23,210
twice as much as feminized so you got

2393
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:25,519
your regular then they're doubled then

2394
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:26,720
they're even doubled again so they will

2395
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,430
let you know if there are auto flowers

2396
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:29,510
just make sure you read the package when

2397
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,710
you're buying your seat that'll either

2398
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:32,989
say regular

2399
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:34,369
feminized or Auto flower just do a

2400
01:24:32,988 --> 01:24:35,569
little research before you buy your

2401
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,789
seeds make sure you know what you're

2402
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:40,369
getting now let's talk a little bit

2403
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:42,738
about how these auto flower seeds are

2404
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:43,609
useful if you've been listening to the

2405
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:45,409
show for a while

2406
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:48,139
you love my favorite example of these

2407
01:24:45,409 --> 01:24:50,238
Auto flowers and use several years ago

2408
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:52,550
there was a very large grow discovered

2409
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:54,319
in a national forest not too far from

2410
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:57,770
here and it was discovered that that

2411
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:59,689
grow was ran by a cartel as the reports

2412
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:01,550
and pictures came out they were saying

2413
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:03,529
that the cartel had three different

2414
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:05,690
stages of growth happening in their

2415
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:07,309
illegal grow area now that really made

2416
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:10,129
me wonder how are they growing different

2417
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:11,750
stages outdoors because the Sun dictates

2418
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:13,460
what our plants do if they put him

2419
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,930
outside they all went into flower at the

2420
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,719
same time then my brain went dude

2421
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:20,329
they're using Auto flowers so this large

2422
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:22,069
cartel would set a patch of auto flower

2423
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:23,840
plants then they would wait a few weeks

2424
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:25,819
and they would set another large patch

2425
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,829
of auto flower plants wait a few weeks

2426
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:30,109
and set another large patch of auto

2427
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:32,029
flower plants tor eventually they had a

2428
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:34,189
perpetual cycle going to where they had

2429
01:25:32,029 --> 01:25:36,979
people out there in this national forest

2430
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:39,500
does camouflaged hidden growing a

2431
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:40,759
perpetual grow packaging up and sending

2432
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,140
it to who knows where I have no idea

2433
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,699
where it was going but they were

2434
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:45,800
producing quite a bit of cannabis out

2435
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:48,170
there by using Auto flowers they had a

2436
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,029
perpetual grow under the natural Sun

2437
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:51,289
they didn't have to veg and then flower

2438
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:52,699
they could just throw the seeds out

2439
01:25:51,289 --> 01:25:55,850
there they would grow and do their thing

2440
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:57,920
so that's one way where auto flower

2441
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,750
seeds were highly effective now let's

2442
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,909
scale that down a little bit let's say

2443
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:04,460
you've only got one grow space and you

2444
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:06,019
want to produce a perpetual grow you

2445
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:08,719
don't have a bedroom you don't have a

2446
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:10,520
flower room you can't go buy clones from

2447
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,619
a friend you can't have a friend veg for

2448
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,080
you the way you could run a small self

2449
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:17,689
sustainable perpetual grow is with Auto

2450
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:19,039
flower plants in one room fill up a

2451
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:21,139
quarter or half of the room with Auto

2452
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,909
flowers as soon as they start flowering

2453
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:25,039
plant more Auto flowers and put them in

2454
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:27,199
the same room you'll have veg plants and

2455
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,510
flowering plants in the same room you

2456
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:31,399
can't do that with photo period plants

2457
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:33,500
so if you're limited on space if you've

2458
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:35,779
only got one room that's a really useful

2459
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:39,050
method and a really useful application

2460
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:40,759
for auto flowering plants the major

2461
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:42,890
downside that iceice auto flowering

2462
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,150
plants is you always have to buy new

2463
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:46,340
seeds you can

2464
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:48,198
clone an auto flowering plant if you're

2465
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:50,239
growing with regular or feminized

2466
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:52,039
photoperiod seeds you're always able to

2467
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,839
cut a clone you can keep that clone as a

2468
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:55,579
mother you can keep it perpetually and

2469
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,199
then you can always clone off of that

2470
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:59,448
mother and you can keep that plant

2471
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:01,609
sustainable with Auto flowers you're

2472
01:26:59,448 --> 01:27:03,500
always going to be buying new seeds and

2473
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:05,210
earlier I mentioned most of the Auto

2474
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,010
flower companies are only putting out

2475
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:09,408
feminized so you're not even able to

2476
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:11,239
breed your own Auto flowers with males

2477
01:27:09,408 --> 01:27:13,039
and females anymore you're gonna have to

2478
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:15,349
reverse one and I have no experience

2479
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:17,689
doing that all right you guys that is my

2480
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:20,750
breakdown on regular seeds feminized

2481
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:22,789
seeds and autoflowering seeds the

2482
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,619
regular seeds are always photo period I

2483
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:25,189
like them because we find males and

2484
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:26,809
females

2485
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:28,250
I like breeding with the regular seeds

2486
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:30,739
that's a lot of fun for me

2487
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,929
the feminized seeds can be photo period

2488
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:34,879
or they can be Auto flower they are

2489
01:27:32,929 --> 01:27:37,130
probably well marked on the packaging

2490
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,260
those are always going to be females if

2491
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:40,789
they were bred properly I've done a

2492
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:43,360
whole nother podcast episode about

2493
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:45,679
marking feminized seeds with s or r1

2494
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:48,500
generations I encourage you to listen to

2495
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:50,510
that one that one is episode 331 and

2496
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,010
it's titled selfing and reversals you

2497
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:54,590
learn a lot about why we label the

2498
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:56,630
packages the way we do also I recommend

2499
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:59,300
you listen to an episode called seed

2500
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:01,489
pack expectations and that is number 245

2501
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,719
there's a lot of useful information in

2502
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:04,939
that episode for anyone who's

2503
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,079
considering purchasing new seeds then

2504
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:08,178
we'll keep it moving we talked about

2505
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:10,309
autoflowering seeds auto flowering

2506
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:12,319
plants are unique to photoperiod plants

2507
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:14,449
because they flower based on their size

2508
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,549
or their age we can put them under the

2509
01:28:14,448 --> 01:28:18,559
veg lights we can have them in the 1860

2510
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:20,690
and they will still flower and they will

2511
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,429
still produce buds a lot of auto

2512
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:25,009
flowering plants boast that they will be

2513
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:27,408
completely done around ten weeks so

2514
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:29,539
that's 70 days of a full cycle with a

2515
01:28:27,408 --> 01:28:31,279
photo period plant you've got closer to

2516
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:34,279
a hundred and twenty days if you want

2517
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:36,469
usable product so that is my lesson on

2518
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:39,170
regular feminized and autoflowering

2519
01:28:36,469 --> 01:28:41,000
seeds I hope I made your decision easier

2520
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:42,949
when it comes time to go shopping don't

2521
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,869
be afraid to try regular seeds don't be

2522
01:28:42,948 --> 01:28:46,789
afraid to try feminized seeds and don't

2523
01:28:44,869 --> 01:28:48,679
be afraid to try Auto flower seeds you

2524
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:50,238
just may fall in love with something you

2525
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:52,250
never thought you would even like and

2526
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:55,250
don't forget you can find your seeds at

skittles ambrosia that left a nice

2571

orange flavor in my mouth gave me a nice

2572
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:25,810
head buzz I followed that up with the

2573
01:30:23,859 --> 01:30:27,939
last dab of the bubble Jack

01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:47,230
along I suggest you go back to episode

2582
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:49,480
351 and start there and get caught up

2583
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:51,669
that will give you a solid foundation on

2584
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:53,619
planning your grow and getting prepared

2585
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:55,210
for your new grow if you've been

2586
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:57,189
following along you know that we've

2587
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:58,899
selected our space we've selected our

2588
01:30:57,189 --> 01:31:01,269
equipment we've done a lot of talk about

2589
01:30:58,899 --> 01:31:03,129
genetics and now this episode is going

2590
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:05,620
to be about sprouting our new seeds

2591
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:08,050
let's not waste too much time let's jump

2592
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:09,819
right into it seeds can be expensive

2593
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:11,199
depending on who you ordered them from

2594
01:31:09,819 --> 01:31:12,819
how many you BA

2595
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:15,669
what kind you purchased you may have

2596
01:31:12,819 --> 01:31:17,649
spent a lot of money on seeds before you

2597
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:20,079
think about germinating your new seeds I

2598
01:31:17,649 --> 01:31:23,379
highly recommend you have your veg area

2599
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:24,909
ready to rock before you even think

2600
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,710
about starting your seeds

2601
01:31:24,909 --> 01:31:28,329
you're gonna think oh I can just driven

2602
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:29,890
ate these seeds and then I'll build up

2603
01:31:28,329 --> 01:31:31,779
this veg room in the next couple of days

2604
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:34,179
and then while they veg will work on the

2605
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:36,909
flower room once you get plants going

2606
01:31:34,179 --> 01:31:38,710
you start time-traveling things go so

2607
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:40,479
much more quickly than you anticipate

2608
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:42,489
things pop up things get in your way

2609
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,409
then you fall behind then those seeds

2610
01:31:42,488 --> 01:31:45,729
you just paid a bunch of money for start

2611
01:31:44,409 --> 01:31:47,800
growing funky they get out of control

2612
01:31:45,729 --> 01:31:49,299
and you've got shitty plants to start

2613
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,810
with and you're frustrated from the

2614
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,960
beginning

2615
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:55,660
so before you germinate your seeds have

2616
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,730
your veg space prepared that is my very

2617
01:31:55,659 --> 01:31:59,769
first piece of advice to you that will

2618
01:31:57,729 --> 01:32:02,019
save you a lot of frustration now my

2619
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:04,120
second piece of advice is to start with

2620
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,130
quality seed try to get your seeds from

2621
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:08,679
a reputable vendor and also from a

2622
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:10,510
reputable breeder don't fall for hype

2623
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:12,819
when you're shopping for seeds don't be

2624
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:14,530
sold try to find somebody with a good

2625
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:17,109
reputation somebody that you have heard

2626
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:18,639
of and also try to buy those seeds from

2627
01:32:17,109 --> 01:32:20,139
a vendor with the good reputation

2628
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,789
somebody that you have heard of somebody

2629
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,739
that has a good relationship with the

2630
01:32:21,789 --> 01:32:25,899
breeders and if you're going to buy

2631
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:27,939
seeds online I recommend you buy from a

2632
01:32:25,899 --> 01:32:29,859
seed vendor in the United States that

2633
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:32,259
way you don't have to risk customs of

2634
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:32,829
course I recommend the hella DANC seed

2635
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,590
company

2636
01:32:32,829 --> 01:32:37,960
I also recommend the seed Bazaar and I

2637
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:40,390
can also vouch for Southern Oregon seeds

2638
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:42,159
those are three quality seed vendors

2639
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:44,110
that I trust and respect and I work with

2640
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:46,090
them personally so I know they will take

2641
01:32:44,109 --> 01:32:48,159
good care of you I'm not bashing any

2642
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:50,529
other seed company I'm just saying I

2643
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,269
rely on these three companies I have

2644
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:54,429
worked with them I've got a relationship

2645
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:57,250
with them and I know they are rock-solid

2646
01:32:54,429 --> 01:32:59,079
so I recommend you start with a quality

2647
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,609
seed something you know what the parents

2648
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:01,719
of that seed were something you know

2649
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:04,659
where it came from

2650
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:06,670
if you don't have access to fancy label

2651
01:33:04,659 --> 01:33:08,979
the expensive seeds grow what you've got

2652
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:10,600
in an ideal world we would all go to the

2653
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:12,369
store and we look at the shelf and we'd

2654
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,900
say you've got that strain that was the

2655
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:15,640
best I've ever smoked I want seeds of

2656
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:18,429
that and I get that that's everybody's

2657
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,440
fantasy that day is coming unfortunately

2658
01:33:18,429 --> 01:33:21,489
we are not there yet for everybody some

2659
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:23,379
people are going to have to be

2660
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:24,668
resourceful you may have bought a bag of

2661
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,739
weed ten years ago it's

2662
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:27,880
random place and it had seeds in it then

2663
01:33:26,738 --> 01:33:29,589
you're gonna have to grow those seeds

2664
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,479
you never know what you're gonna get out

2665
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:33,489
of those seeds you could find duds you

2666
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:36,070
could find hermaphrodites you may find

2667
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:37,868
the next magical strain in there so grow

2668
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:39,698
what you've got no matter where your

2669
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:41,380
seeds come from whether they're regular

2670
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:43,238
whether they're feminized seeds pay

2671
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,769
close attention to them pay attention

2672
01:33:43,238 --> 01:33:46,418
for males pay attention for

2673
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:48,039
hermaphrodite um pay attention for

2674
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:50,109
problems you will have to keep an eye

2675
01:33:48,038 --> 01:33:52,059
out when you're growing from seed now if

2676
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:53,618
you've got a bag of seeds lying around

2677
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,748
and you don't know what any of them are

2678
01:33:53,618 --> 01:33:57,098
it's just a perhaps a sandwich bag or a

2679
01:33:55,748 --> 01:33:59,050
little mason jar just stuffed with

2680
01:33:57,099 --> 01:34:00,729
random seeds from bags of cannabis

2681
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,010
you've gone through over time and you

2682
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:04,659
can't decide what to grow I go for the

2683
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:07,149
really healthy-looking seeds and by

2684
01:34:04,658 --> 01:34:09,279
healthy I mean probably darker probably

2685
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:10,899
bigger a lot of people like the tiger

2686
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,518
stripes that's always a good sign some

2687
01:34:10,899 --> 01:34:13,840
seeds will not make tiger stripes no

2688
01:34:12,519 --> 01:34:15,550
matter how long they grow no matter how

2689
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,880
mature no matter how healthy and strong

2690
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,708
they are

2691
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,809
they just won't stripe up that's just a

2692
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:21,788
genetic thing I prefer the darker

2693
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:23,229
colored seeds the harder seeds I give

2694
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:24,609
them a little press on the table I hope

2695
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:26,260
they don't crack if they don't crack

2696
01:34:24,609 --> 01:34:27,788
that's probably a good seed if it cracks

2697
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:30,309
it obviously isn't gonna grow that too

2698
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:31,929
dead seed a lot of people like a larger

2699
01:34:30,309 --> 01:34:34,630
cannabis seed but I've noticed that a

2700
01:34:31,929 --> 01:34:37,179
lot of strains produce little tiny seeds

2701
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:39,309
so sometimes a little tiny cannabis seed

2702
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:41,168
can produce a seriously potent plant

2703
01:34:39,309 --> 01:34:43,538
don't judge it too much by the size

2704
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:45,998
judge it more by the health of the seed

2705
01:34:43,538 --> 01:34:48,009
a lot of the grayer white colored seeds

2706
01:34:45,998 --> 01:34:49,688
will grow I don't put those in my packs

2707
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:52,208
because people freak out I grow those

2708
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:54,099
myself but those lighter gray the paler

2709
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:55,779
colored seeds those will grow the white

2710
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:57,369
seeds those are more questionable I

2711
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:59,618
don't think the white seeds do as well

2712
01:34:57,368 --> 01:35:01,779
the gray kind of silver shiny seeds

2713
01:34:59,618 --> 01:35:03,698
those usually have a good take off the

2714
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,590
darker ones those take off quite quickly

2715
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,748
and then of course you get those bigger

2716
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:09,519
harder tiger-stripe seeds those really

2717
01:35:07,748 --> 01:35:12,578
have a lot of figure and they take off

2718
01:35:09,519 --> 01:35:14,949
really quickly for you so seed health is

2719
01:35:12,578 --> 01:35:16,538
important selecting healthy seeds if

2720
01:35:14,948 --> 01:35:18,339
you've got a big bag of seeds try to

2721
01:35:16,538 --> 01:35:20,408
select the healthiest looking beans out

2722
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:22,149
of that bag maybe a couple of them just

2723
01:35:20,408 --> 01:35:23,859
call you maybe you've got a bag of a

2724
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:25,599
thousand seeds and two of them just go

2725
01:35:23,859 --> 01:35:27,518
hey bro I'm the seeds you want to grow

2726
01:35:25,599 --> 01:35:30,369
right now listen to that kind of stuff

2727
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:32,168
that is usually accurate alright now

2728
01:35:30,368 --> 01:35:33,848
we've got our veg space ready we know

2729
01:35:32,168 --> 01:35:35,679
what to look for in quality seeds we've

2730
01:35:33,849 --> 01:35:37,750
got some seeds on hand and it is

2731
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,609
to germinate our seeds what do I mean by

2732
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:42,039
germinate it's just a fancy word for

2733
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:44,559
starting the seeds we need to give them

2734
01:35:42,039 --> 01:35:46,179
the proper conditions to make them start

2735
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,260
we want to crack the seed open we don't

2736
01:35:46,179 --> 01:35:48,969
want to do it we want it to happen

2737
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:50,920
naturally we want the seed to crack

2738
01:35:48,969 --> 01:35:52,719
itself open and we want a little tiny

2739
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,929
tap root to come fishing out and that is

2740
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,939
the start of life in nature those seeds

2741
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:59,920
would fall out of last year's but winter

2742
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:02,109
would come it would knock those seeds at

2743
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,940
those the buds would dry the wind and

2744
01:36:02,109 --> 01:36:05,710
the moisture would knock those seeds out

2745
01:36:03,939 --> 01:36:07,329
of those buds those buds would fall into

2746
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:08,739
the ground winter would come and

2747
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:11,198
everything would be frozen for a little

2748
01:36:08,738 --> 01:36:12,988
while as the spring came and the winter

2749
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,488
frost or the winter moisture started

2750
01:36:12,988 --> 01:36:17,769
moistening down into the soil those

2751
01:36:15,488 --> 01:36:20,319
seeds would begin to receive moisture

2752
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:22,540
and warmth from nature that would

2753
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,948
trigger them to Germany than they would

2754
01:36:22,539 --> 01:36:25,329
sprout up they would find their way up

2755
01:36:23,948 --> 01:36:27,039
dig up out of the soil they'd start

2756
01:36:25,329 --> 01:36:28,238
seeing Sun and they'd go Here I am and

2757
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:30,550
then they would live and they would

2758
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,500
become little baby cannabis plants now

2759
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:34,210
human involvement will we've done we

2760
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,640
have collected the seeds before they

2761
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:38,079
fall out of the but when I breed I let

2762
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,940
the plants get done and let the seeds

2763
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:41,679
get finished I cut the plants down I let

2764
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:43,779
them hang they dry then I basically

2765
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,579
crumble up the buds and I manually

2766
01:36:43,779 --> 01:36:47,259
remove the Caesar several methods of

2767
01:36:45,579 --> 01:36:49,479
doing that that's not important right

2768
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:51,369
now but that process happened then those

2769
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:53,049
seeds were passed on to you that you

2770
01:36:51,369 --> 01:36:55,238
have to play the role of mother nature

2771
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:57,460
we have to give these seeds the proper

2772
01:36:55,238 --> 01:37:00,039
environment to trigger them to start

2773
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:02,079
their life the two main things that are

2774
01:37:00,039 --> 01:37:05,198
going to start our seeds are water and

2775
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:07,479
warmth the main thing being water warmth

2776
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:08,919
very secondary to that warmth will speed

2777
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:11,829
up the process and make them much

2778
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:14,289
happier now there are countless ways to

2779
01:37:11,829 --> 01:37:16,420
start new seeds I'm going to cover four

2780
01:37:14,289 --> 01:37:18,460
or five methods here in this episode and

2781
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:20,649
I'm going to start with the method I use

2782
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:23,679
personally I like the old school paper

2783
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:25,479
towel technique it is very simple I get

2784
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:27,460
a plate out of the cover just a glass

2785
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:30,369
plate like you serve a meal on or make a

2786
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:32,380
sandwich I also get a paper towel just

2787
01:37:30,369 --> 01:37:35,469
like you'd use to clean up that meal or

2788
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:37,690
that sandwich I fold the paper towel one

2789
01:37:35,469 --> 01:37:39,158
time then I fold it again now you've

2790
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:42,219
just got a little rectangular paper

2791
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:44,619
towel I set that paper towel on to the

2792
01:37:42,219 --> 01:37:45,219
glass plate and then I get a bottle of

2793
01:37:44,619 --> 01:37:47,139
water

2794
01:37:45,219 --> 01:37:48,609
I prefer bottled water for this because

2795
01:37:47,139 --> 01:37:49,050
I don't want the chlorine or whatever

2796
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:51,149
else

2797
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:53,250
in my tap water affecting my new

2798
01:37:51,149 --> 01:37:55,889
ceilings so I've got the folded paper

2799
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:58,020
towel sitting on the plate I simply soak

2800
01:37:55,890 --> 01:38:01,950
that paper towel with water it will only

2801
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:03,870
hold so much I simply saturate it then I

2802
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:05,639
tip the plate to the side to make sure

2803
01:38:03,869 --> 01:38:07,619
all that excess water runs out of the

2804
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:09,270
paper towel and off of that plate just

2805
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:12,269
drain it right off into the sink that

2806
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:14,280
water is gone so now you've got a soggy

2807
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:16,560
paper towel in the middle of a plate

2808
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:18,779
I place my seeds in the paper towel and

2809
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,670
then I gently fold it one more time if

2810
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:22,019
you want to fold it another time you can

2811
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:23,789
and make a little tiny square that's

2812
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,510
fine but I think that first fold will be

2813
01:38:23,789 --> 01:38:26,640
just fine

2814
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:28,289
just fold it up toward those seeds or in

2815
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:30,000
the middle and they're getting wet and

2816
01:38:28,289 --> 01:38:31,500
they're not getting any light the way

2817
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,270
that that wet paper towel works it'll

2818
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,710
kind of seal itself up so the seeds

2819
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:36,780
won't move around too much there won't

2820
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:38,699
be any light in there so you've got some

2821
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:40,769
seeds folded up in a wet paper towel and

2822
01:38:38,699 --> 01:38:43,260
those are sitting on a plate now at this

2823
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:45,510
point you've got a couple of options if

2824
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:47,489
you are able to pay attention to those

2825
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:50,579
seeds and be around them all the time

2826
01:38:47,489 --> 01:38:52,800
and make sure they don't get dry you can

2827
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:55,979
just leave them on that plate and leave

2828
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,170
them exposed if it's not too hot or not

2829
01:38:55,979 --> 01:39:00,779
too cold in your area they will sprout

2830
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:03,930
just fine just left sitting like that if

2831
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:06,090
you want to slow down the amount of

2832
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:08,039
moisture leaving that paper towel and

2833
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:09,440
try to keep it moist a little bit longer

2834
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:12,210
without having to pay so much attention

2835
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:13,889
just set another plate over it flip the

2836
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:15,659
plate upside down and set it on top of

2837
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:16,950
the first plate just like you do if you

2838
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:18,689
had a sandwich in there and he didn't

2839
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:20,670
want anything to get to the sandwich so

2840
01:39:18,689 --> 01:39:22,169
you just got two plates with your little

2841
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:24,300
folded up paper towel in there

2842
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:27,720
you have to keep it moist at all times

2843
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:30,239
do not let it get dry if you feel like

2844
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,710
you're going to get forgetful or if you

2845
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,569
need to go to work for an extended

2846
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:35,609
period of time and you cannot monitor

2847
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:38,909
the moisture of your new seedlings you

2848
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:40,799
can always set them in a baggie put your

2849
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:43,289
folded paper towel with the moisture in

2850
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,150
it in a baggie this will give the

2851
01:39:43,289 --> 01:39:47,039
moisture nowhere to go it will be

2852
01:39:45,149 --> 01:39:48,869
trapped inside that little environment

2853
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,269
just make sure you check on them as soon

2854
01:39:48,869 --> 01:39:53,099
as you get home from work if you leave

2855
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:55,170
that wet paper towel folded up in a

2856
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:58,289
baggie in a really warm spot for too

2857
01:39:55,170 --> 01:40:00,270
long you can create a mildew situation

2858
01:39:58,289 --> 01:40:01,479
so make sure you pop that open get some

2859
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,220
fresh air in there and

2860
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:05,469
check on that as soon as you get home

2861
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:07,690
from work so it sounds really easy

2862
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:08,949
because it is you were folding a paper

2863
01:40:07,689 --> 01:40:10,689
towel into a square

2864
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:13,090
your moistening it you're letting the

2865
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:14,889
excess moisture run off we set the seeds

2866
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,720
onto that moist paper towel and then we

2867
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:18,789
fold it to cover them up and then if you

2868
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,770
need to place another plate over it to

2869
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:22,420
slow down the dry time if you're really

2870
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:24,520
forgetful and you're gonna be away for a

2871
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:27,789
while put it in a baggie to retain that

2872
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:30,430
moisture then set it somewhere semi warm

2873
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:32,649
most of the time if you are comfortable

2874
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:34,869
in that area your ceilings are probably

2875
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:37,269
comfortable as well room temperature is

2876
01:40:34,869 --> 01:40:39,550
acceptable for seedlings a great spot

2877
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:41,650
for seedlings if you do not forget them

2878
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:43,510
is on top of the refrigerator that

2879
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:45,759
temperature that happens right on top of

2880
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:47,949
the refrigerator is perfect for

2881
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,480
seedlings if you don't forget them put

2882
01:40:47,949 --> 01:40:52,359
them in a baggie set them right on top

2883
01:40:49,479 --> 01:40:55,000
they should be ready in 12 to 24 maybe

2884
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:57,488
36 hours if you've got one of those old

2885
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,319
big TVs nobody's got those big old TVs

2886
01:40:57,488 --> 01:41:01,509
anymore they used to get warm on the

2887
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:03,849
back that was a great spot to set

2888
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:06,610
seedlings and a baggie was on the back

2889
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:07,960
of the old Sony Trinitron 36 inch TV

2890
01:41:06,609 --> 01:41:10,029
where it got warm from playing video

2891
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,640
games all day that would be the perfect

2892
01:41:10,029 --> 01:41:14,380
temp for seedlings other than those

2893
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,180
subtle heat sources like the top of the

2894
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:17,590
fridge or the back of the TV I really

2895
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,659
don't recommend a heat map for

2896
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:21,310
germinating new seeds or for your clones

2897
01:41:19,659 --> 01:41:23,920
I've seen more clones and seeds

2898
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:25,780
destroyed roasted and barbecued than I

2899
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,520
have ever seen assisted by one of those

2900
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:29,500
heat mats but I'm gonna talk about that

2901
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,390
more later in the episode I think so

2902
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,069
let's skip that for now and try to stay

2903
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:34,930
focused alright so we've got our

2904
01:41:33,069 --> 01:41:37,059
seedlings they are folded up in a paper

2905
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:38,440
towel we're keeping them moist we don't

2906
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:40,239
want them soggy we don't want them

2907
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:42,639
dripping all the time we want to keep

2908
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:43,959
them moist and comfortable so you've got

2909
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,850
them folded in the paper towel and you

2910
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,890
were checking on them every few hours if

2911
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,300
you were able they're easy to check on

2912
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:50,890
just set your hand right on that paper

2913
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,570
towel don't crush the seeds just set

2914
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:54,220
your hand on there gently and if the

2915
01:41:52,569 --> 01:41:54,549
paper towel is kind of cold kind of

2916
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:56,739
chilly

2917
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:58,600
they're probably wet enough if you don't

2918
01:41:56,738 --> 01:42:00,159
feel like it's wet enough moisten it up

2919
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,660
a little bit get your water bottle and

2920
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:03,819
just pour the water on there gently and

2921
01:42:01,659 --> 01:42:05,500
then tip the Tiye that plate over toward

2922
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:07,090
the excess water runs off into the sink

2923
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:09,069
and then you've got a moistened up for

2924
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:12,550
the rest of the day they should only be

2925
01:42:09,069 --> 01:42:14,689
in this paper towel for 12 to 24 maybe

2926
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:16,969
36 or 48 hours before

2927
01:42:14,689 --> 01:42:19,009
you see them starting to pop open it

2928
01:42:16,969 --> 01:42:20,869
will pop open on one side and a little

2929
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:23,840
white tail will start coming out that is

2930
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:26,149
exactly what we are looking for that is

2931
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,800
the start of life that is a taproot that

2932
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:29,569
is the beginning of everything that

2933
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,579
little root is gonna dig down into the

2934
01:42:29,569 --> 01:42:33,109
pot once we pot it and it's gonna dig

2935
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,969
down and start finding nutrients and

2936
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:36,920
that's gonna be the legs that's gonna be

2937
01:42:34,969 --> 01:42:38,719
the foundation and then it's gonna start

2938
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:40,190
shooting that seedling straight upward

2939
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,390
toward the light and then it's gonna

2940
01:42:40,189 --> 01:42:42,859
shoot little leaves out of there and

2941
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,000
that little seedling will fall off and

2942
01:42:42,859 --> 01:42:46,039
then you've got a little plant so that

2943
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,630
is the start of everything happening

2944
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:48,948
right there and you get to see it

2945
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:50,449
because you've just got it right there

2946
01:42:48,948 --> 01:42:52,488
in that paper towel it's not buried

2947
01:42:50,448 --> 01:42:54,229
under anything so you can check on them

2948
01:42:52,488 --> 01:42:55,939
check on them about twelve hours if you

2949
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:58,369
don't see anything check on them in 24

2950
01:42:55,939 --> 01:43:00,198
hours if you don't see anything go 36

2951
01:42:58,369 --> 01:43:01,609
you're gonna get impatient after 24

2952
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:03,169
hours you'll be checking out on every 4

2953
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:05,479
to 6 hours don't worry just keep

2954
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,190
checking don't forget about them we only

2955
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:09,139
need maybe an eighth of an inch maybe a

2956
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:11,359
quarter of an inch of that tap root to

2957
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:13,670
pop out before our seedlings are ready

2958
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:16,339
to put into soil but we will get to that

2959
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:18,560
so I think I covered how to germinate

2960
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:20,569
seeds in a paper towel you fold it you

2961
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,670
wet it you drain it put the seeds in

2962
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:24,799
there fold it again and then you keep an

2963
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:28,399
eye on it and keep it moist keep it

2964
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,600
slightly warm but don't roast it if you

2965
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:31,579
think you might forget about your

2966
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,230
seedlings place the paper towel set up

2967
01:43:31,579 --> 01:43:35,988
and a baggie and that will keep them

2968
01:43:33,229 --> 01:43:38,089
moist until you open it once again don't

2969
01:43:35,988 --> 01:43:39,948
forget about them make sure you check on

2970
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:41,360
them then when you unfold that paper

2971
01:43:39,948 --> 01:43:43,429
towel and you've got a little tap root

2972
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,710
sticking out that's when it's time to

2973
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:47,119
get ready to put them into your potting

2974
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:49,520
mix but we're gonna talk about that a

2975
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:51,800
little bit later the only thing left to

2976
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,469
cover in this section is what if those

2977
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,270
seeds don't pop open after 48 hours the

2978
01:43:54,469 --> 01:43:58,100
only thing you can really do is wait a

2979
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:59,960
little bit longer maybe increase the

2980
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,489
heat if you didn't already set them on

2981
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,810
the fridge maybe set them up there on

2982
01:44:01,488 --> 01:44:03,529
top of the refrigerator where it's a

2983
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,360
little warmer

2984
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:07,159
maybe lessen the moisture maybe you've

2985
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:09,469
got them a little too wet maybe just

2986
01:44:07,159 --> 01:44:10,639
keep that paper towel just damp maybe

2987
01:44:09,469 --> 01:44:11,989
you've still got a little bit of a

2988
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:15,230
chance but if they haven't opened after

2989
01:44:11,988 --> 01:44:18,198
48 or 72 hours I would consider starting

2990
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:20,059
a fresh batch of seeds at that point now

2991
01:44:18,198 --> 01:44:22,069
if it is really cold in your environment

2992
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,989
it will take longer for your seeds to

2993
01:44:22,069 --> 01:44:25,698
germinate so expect that if you're

2994
01:44:23,988 --> 01:44:26,750
growing in the basement in Colorado

2995
01:44:25,698 --> 01:44:28,819
you've got them sitting right

2996
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:31,130
on a concrete floor that's gonna take

2997
01:44:28,819 --> 01:44:32,809
longer consider your environment like I

2998
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:35,779
said earlier the warmth will speed

2999
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:37,610
things up but that too can go wrong in

3000
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:40,550
excess so try to stay in the right area

3001
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:43,130
try to be about 70 to 85 degrees ish and

3002
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:45,350
you should be okay with rapid growth for

3003
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:48,170
your seeds now let's talk about our next

3004
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:50,210
method for sprouting our seeds our next

3005
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:52,069
method is using rapid rooters or route

3006
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:53,600
riots or whatever type of plugs are

3007
01:44:52,069 --> 01:44:57,170
available in your area

3008
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:59,630
although I am NOT including rock wool

3009
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:01,369
cubes in this section I don't like rock

3010
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:03,140
wool cubes for sprouting seeds they do

3011
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:05,090
not work well for sprouting seeds I

3012
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:07,789
would not recommend that if it's what

3013
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:09,860
you've got do it similarly to what I

3014
01:45:07,789 --> 01:45:12,529
recommend here with the rapid rooters

3015
01:45:09,859 --> 01:45:14,689
but before you use your rock wool cubes

3016
01:45:12,529 --> 01:45:16,789
make sure you clean them out and make

3017
01:45:14,689 --> 01:45:18,769
sure you soak them in a pH balanced

3018
01:45:16,789 --> 01:45:20,630
solution rinse them very well to get

3019
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:22,310
anything out of them then soak them

3020
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:24,440
either in clean water or a light

3021
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:27,289
nutrient solution that has been pH

3022
01:45:24,439 --> 01:45:29,599
around 6 you don't want to use rock wool

3023
01:45:27,289 --> 01:45:32,210
cubes without rinsing them and adjusting

3024
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:35,900
the pH so this is all about rapid

3025
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:38,149
rooters or riot plugs when we start with

3026
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:40,279
these plugs we need to soak them so I

3027
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:41,929
get a container based on the amount of

3028
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:43,819
plugs I'm going to use I'm generally

3029
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:45,710
using a five-gallon bucket I think

3030
01:45:43,819 --> 01:45:48,139
they're sold in a 50 pack so most of the

3031
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:50,630
time I just do all 50 and I either do 50

3032
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:52,730
clones or 50 ceilings I just use the

3033
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:54,890
whole package you soak as many as you

3034
01:45:52,729 --> 01:45:56,509
need what I do is I get a container it

3035
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:58,610
will fit enough water to soak as many

3036
01:45:56,510 --> 01:46:01,850
plugs as I'm going to use I adjust the

3037
01:45:58,609 --> 01:46:04,130
pH to somewhere between 6 and 6 3 I

3038
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:06,170
usually place the rapid Rooter plugs

3039
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:07,550
back into the rapid Rooter tray if

3040
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:08,600
you're not using the tray that's okay

3041
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:10,130
you don't need it but that's usually

3042
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,130
what I do I put it right in the tray

3043
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:16,460
then I take a seed and I insert the seed

3044
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:20,480
into the rapid Rooter plug that seed

3045
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:22,819
goes pointy end down if you look at your

3046
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:24,829
seeds it's got a round end and it's got

3047
01:46:22,819 --> 01:46:27,409
a pointy end it will be obvious when you

3048
01:46:24,829 --> 01:46:29,090
look at it the pointy end goes down this

3049
01:46:27,409 --> 01:46:31,939
is important because of the way that the

3050
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:34,430
seed grows pointy end down when you are

3051
01:46:31,939 --> 01:46:36,109
putting it into a rapid Rooter or any

3052
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:40,150
sort of a cube or if you are going

3053
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:42,908
directly into soil pointy end down all

3054
01:46:40,149 --> 01:46:44,920
so if you are going into a rapid Rooter

3055
01:46:42,908 --> 01:46:47,049
if you're going into a root riot cube if

3056
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:48,789
you're going into soil or if you're

3057
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:51,010
going against my advice and you're going

3058
01:46:48,789 --> 01:46:52,689
directly into rock wool it is always

3059
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:55,690
suggested that you plant your seeds

3060
01:46:52,689 --> 01:46:57,460
about one knuckle deep just go just the

3061
01:46:55,689 --> 01:46:59,649
tip of your finger just push it in until

3062
01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:01,359
you press that first knuckle right that

3063
01:46:59,649 --> 01:47:03,189
first bend in your finger that's far

3064
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,960
enough stop pushing that ceiling is deep

3065
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:06,908
enough into the soil it's deep enough

3066
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,380
into that cube it will live there it

3067
01:47:06,908 --> 01:47:10,179
doesn't need to be buried way down in

3068
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:12,760
there it stands a much better chance if

3069
01:47:10,179 --> 01:47:14,619
it's just about knuckle deep as all you

3070
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:16,179
need to go so after I've got all my

3071
01:47:14,619 --> 01:47:18,340
seedlings planted and I've got all my

3072
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:19,690
cubes labeled make sure you label each

3073
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:21,640
cube if you're planning different

3074
01:47:19,689 --> 01:47:23,678
strains make sure you've got a way to

3075
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,780
label each cube so you know what you've

3076
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:27,550
got also label if you're doing more than

3077
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:29,559
one paper-towel of seeds make sure you

3078
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:31,119
label that paper towel some way most of

3079
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:32,320
you're just doing one pack of seeds or

3080
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:34,988
one strain but if you're doing multiple

3081
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:37,059
please carefully label things so we've

3082
01:47:34,988 --> 01:47:38,769
got our seeds they are in our rapid

3083
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,719
Rooter cubes they're carefully labeled

3084
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:42,280
they are nice and moist they are about

3085
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,550
knuckle deep down into the end of the

3086
01:47:42,279 --> 01:47:47,170
cube now I place them under a very white

3087
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:49,510
light you don't need very powerful

3088
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:52,658
lighting for sprouting seeds a really

3089
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:54,579
weak LED or a t5 kind of high up is

3090
01:47:52,658 --> 01:47:57,099
plenty of lighting a compact fluorescent

3091
01:47:54,579 --> 01:47:59,590
is probably just enough light you don't

3092
01:47:57,100 --> 01:48:01,150
need to go extreme for a ceiling just

3093
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:02,770
enough to encourage it to grow once it

3094
01:48:01,149 --> 01:48:05,319
gets bigger we do need light but right

3095
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:07,030
now we don't need ridiculous lighting

3096
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:08,710
for a small seedling so place it under a

3097
01:48:07,029 --> 01:48:10,658
light that will give you a warmth and

3098
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:12,369
that will encourage it to grow now in

3099
01:48:10,658 --> 01:48:14,198
about two or three days maybe four or

3100
01:48:12,369 --> 01:48:16,149
five days at the latest you should see a

3101
01:48:14,198 --> 01:48:18,579
little sprout pop out of your cube and

3102
01:48:16,149 --> 01:48:20,559
you have now got a little seedling now

3103
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:22,719
that seedling can live in that little

3104
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,820
rapid Rooter for several days but it's

3105
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,859
going to need a forever home it's going

3106
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:29,889
to need to go into either some soil or a

3107
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:31,809
hydro set up fairly soon while it's in

3108
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:33,610
that rapid Rooter we need to keep it

3109
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:35,980
warm we need to keep it somewhere

3110
01:48:33,609 --> 01:48:38,529
between 70 and 85 degrees and we need to

3111
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:40,779
keep that root cube moist at all times

3112
01:48:38,529 --> 01:48:42,819
once it dries up that plant has no live

3113
01:48:40,779 --> 01:48:44,920
source and it will die so keep it moist

3114
01:48:42,819 --> 01:48:46,719
and keep it warm and keep it under a

3115
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:49,210
light and then we need to think about

3116
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:51,969
getting it into a good potting mix or

3117
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:53,300
into a hydro system very soon so that it

3118
01:48:51,969 --> 01:48:55,159
can thrive

3119
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:57,920
that is the basics of sprouting a seed

3120
01:48:55,159 --> 01:49:00,260
in a rapid Rooter or a root riot cube or

3121
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,539
against my advice if you choose to use a

3122
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:05,180
rock wool cube you would use a similar

3123
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:07,909
method basically soak it with a proper

3124
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:10,100
pH solution then press the ceiling in

3125
01:49:07,909 --> 01:49:12,229
pointy in down and only go about a

3126
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:15,140
knuckle deep set it under a light and

3127
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:17,449
leave it alone for two or three days you

3128
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:19,730
should see a little sprout pop up if you

3129
01:49:17,449 --> 01:49:21,470
don't see the sprout pop up look in the

3130
01:49:19,729 --> 01:49:24,109
little hole and see what you see

3131
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:26,210
sometimes the seedling simply gets

3132
01:49:24,109 --> 01:49:28,549
caught and it's bent over and it can't

3133
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:32,210
pop itself up out of the root cube that

3134
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:35,409
happens you can carefully get a pair of

3135
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:37,909
tweezers or a chopstick and very gently

3136
01:49:35,409 --> 01:49:39,739
encourage that plant to grow straight up

3137
01:49:37,909 --> 01:49:42,139
don't pull it out of the seed casing

3138
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:44,300
don't pull it out of the cube maybe

3139
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:46,430
spread the whole of the cube open just a

3140
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:48,260
little bit and encourage it to pop out

3141
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:48,650
of there just needs to bend up and come

3142
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:51,050
out

3143
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:53,629
you can probably guide it out if you're

3144
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:55,699
gentle if it's close to doing it on its

3145
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:57,289
own don't touch it just let it struggle

3146
01:49:55,699 --> 01:49:58,579
and it will come out if you feel like

3147
01:49:57,289 --> 01:50:01,069
it's been long enough and you're getting

3148
01:49:58,579 --> 01:50:03,590
impatient just give it a little tug it

3149
01:50:01,069 --> 01:50:05,359
may pop out for you keep in mind you're

3150
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:07,159
risking killing this ceiling if you get

3151
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:08,719
too rough you're going to destroy it if

3152
01:50:07,159 --> 01:50:11,359
you get too rough but you've got a good

3153
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:13,159
chance just use your thumbs and spread

3154
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,439
that Rapid Rooter open just a little

3155
01:50:13,159 --> 01:50:17,720
tiny bit and you may open it just enough

3156
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:19,189
for that seed to unbind itself and be

3157
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:20,900
able to pop straight up it may just be

3158
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:22,849
stuck it's trying to move up in the two

3159
01:50:20,899 --> 01:50:24,739
leaves on the top they just got stuck

3160
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:26,780
somewhere that happens quite a bit it'll

3161
01:50:24,739 --> 01:50:28,279
just have to break itself free so pay

3162
01:50:26,779 --> 01:50:30,769
attention to that if it doesn't pop up

3163
01:50:28,279 --> 01:50:32,179
in four or five days if the others have

3164
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:34,010
popped up and you've got one that didn't

3165
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:37,039
pop up look in there that could be the

3166
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:38,690
issue with that one seedling now let's

3167
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:40,519
kind of touch on another method that is

3168
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:42,710
very similar to the rapid rooters and

3169
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:45,170
the root riot cubes but it is also very

3170
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:47,539
different this next method you cannot

3171
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:49,760
put this into a hydro kit as simply as

3172
01:50:47,539 --> 01:50:51,680
you could a rapid Rooter or as simply as

3173
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:53,030
you could a seed from a paper towel I'm

3174
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,980
sure some people have done it I'm sure

3175
01:50:53,029 --> 01:50:57,079
some people do it but it's not as easy

3176
01:50:54,979 --> 01:50:59,869
it's much more challenging and it's not

3177
01:50:57,079 --> 01:51:02,750
as logical so let's talk about using

3178
01:50:59,869 --> 01:51:05,149
jiffy cubes jiffy cubes are great if

3179
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:07,069
you're going to go into soil but like I

3180
01:51:05,149 --> 01:51:08,629
said you can't really use them going

3181
01:51:07,069 --> 01:51:09,948
into a hydro system I'm sure there's

3182
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:12,409
somebody doing it gonna tell me I'm

3183
01:51:09,948 --> 01:51:14,960
wrong but it's not common so a jiffy

3184
01:51:12,408 --> 01:51:16,609
cube they're very similar to the rapid

3185
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,189
rooters but they start off really small

3186
01:51:16,609 --> 01:51:21,559
any moisten them and they expand to the

3187
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:23,448
proper size so you moisten them they

3188
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:26,179
puff up you squeeze the excess water out

3189
01:51:23,448 --> 01:51:28,669
of them then from there they work just

3190
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:30,980
like the rapid rooters or the root riot

3191
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:33,469
cubes you place your seeding and sealing

3192
01:51:30,979 --> 01:51:35,718
in their pointy end down you go about

3193
01:51:33,469 --> 01:51:39,230
knuckle deep and then you've got to keep

3194
01:51:35,719 --> 01:51:41,960
your jiffy cube moist just like you do

3195
01:51:39,229 --> 01:51:44,388
with your other cubes now if you're

3196
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:46,429
using rapid rooters or brute riots or

3197
01:51:44,389 --> 01:51:48,199
jiffy cubes or if you're going against

3198
01:51:46,429 --> 01:51:48,739
my advice still and using the rock wool

3199
01:51:48,198 --> 01:51:51,979
cubes

3200
01:51:48,738 --> 01:51:54,888
make sure not to get them too moist for

3201
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:57,559
too long if they are too moist it will

3202
01:51:54,889 --> 01:51:59,750
simply rot your ceilings they will turn

3203
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,429
green they will turn brown it will fall

3204
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,529
over and die or they will not even

3205
01:52:01,429 --> 01:52:05,658
germinate at all there's a big

3206
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:08,359
difference between being soaked and

3207
01:52:05,658 --> 01:52:10,309
being wet and being moist we want to

3208
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:12,469
soak them in the beginning put the seeds

3209
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:14,960
in there when they are soaked then just

3210
01:52:12,469 --> 01:52:17,239
keep it wet from there you can usually

3211
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,920
tell by looking at the rapid rooters how

3212
01:52:17,238 --> 01:52:20,868
dry or wet they are when they start

3213
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:22,368
getting that brown crusty color they're

3214
01:52:20,868 --> 01:52:23,779
too dry when they start getting that

3215
01:52:22,368 --> 01:52:25,460
Sheen to them they start showing a

3216
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:27,349
little silver a little light reflection

3217
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:29,389
that's just right when they're really

3218
01:52:27,349 --> 01:52:32,630
really black that's when they are soaked

3219
01:52:29,389 --> 01:52:35,630
so learn how to identify soaked and

3220
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:37,250
saturated and wet and moist and create a

3221
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:39,020
little scale for yourself I did the 1

3222
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:40,729
through 5 watering technique maybe we

3223
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:42,380
need a similar thing for the rapid

3224
01:52:40,729 --> 01:52:44,029
rooters I kind of just did that if

3225
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:46,219
they're totally soaked in black that's a

3226
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:48,259
5 if they're dry and crispy that's a 1

3227
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:49,730
we need to keep them about a 3 at all

3228
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:51,980
times ladies and gentlemen so there we

3229
01:52:49,729 --> 01:52:54,348
go 1 through 5 tech on rapid rooters

3230
01:52:51,979 --> 01:52:56,299
just like we did on watering normal

3231
01:52:54,349 --> 01:52:58,369
plants so now we know how to germinate

3232
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:00,739
seeds in paper towels we know how to

3233
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:02,658
germinate seeds in rapid rooters we kind

3234
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:05,238
of know how to do it in rock wool cubes

3235
01:53:02,658 --> 01:53:07,399
we know how to germinate seeds in jiffy

3236
01:53:05,238 --> 01:53:09,319
cubes it is just like doing it in the

3237
01:53:07,399 --> 01:53:11,420
rapid rooters you guys you moisten them

3238
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:13,670
they expand you squeeze the excess water

3239
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:16,489
out of there then you treat it just like

3240
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:18,399
a rapid Rooter from there our next

3241
01:53:16,488 --> 01:53:20,908
option is to plant our seedlings

3242
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:22,529
directly into soil that's the way

3243
01:53:20,908 --> 01:53:24,808
happens in nature why wouldn't we do

3244
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:26,309
that in our personal garden so let's

3245
01:53:24,809 --> 01:53:29,159
talk a little bit about planting our

3246
01:53:26,309 --> 01:53:31,708
seeds directly into soil or the medium

3247
01:53:29,158 --> 01:53:34,138
we are going to use if you plan to start

3248
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:37,109
your seedling in soil I highly recommend

3249
01:53:34,139 --> 01:53:39,599
you use a very small container I would

3250
01:53:37,109 --> 01:53:42,658
recommend a beer cup or something that

3251
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:45,689
size there's no reason to have a tiny

3252
01:53:42,658 --> 01:53:48,179
tiny plant in a large container of soil

3253
01:53:45,689 --> 01:53:50,969
so my first recommendation is a small

3254
01:53:48,179 --> 01:53:52,918
container with plenty of drainage my

3255
01:53:50,969 --> 01:53:55,979
second recommendation will be a good

3256
01:53:52,918 --> 01:53:58,229
soil for starter plants something with a

3257
01:53:55,979 --> 01:54:00,090
lot of aeration and something with not

3258
01:53:58,229 --> 01:54:02,369
too much nutrients added to it maybe

3259
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:04,619
something with some mykos or maybe some

3260
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:06,839
beneficial bacteria that's good but we

3261
01:54:04,618 --> 01:54:08,819
don't need a lot of boosts for our

3262
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:11,849
little babies so start with a small

3263
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:14,668
container of high quality starter soil

3264
01:54:11,849 --> 01:54:17,219
so I've got my container and I've got my

3265
01:54:14,668 --> 01:54:19,319
starter soil now i'm oice in that soil

3266
01:54:17,219 --> 01:54:22,559
before I put my seedlings into there

3267
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:24,268
just simply water that soil with a pH

3268
01:54:22,559 --> 01:54:27,449
adjusted solution you don't need

3269
01:54:24,269 --> 01:54:29,639
nutrients just water pH around 6-2 6-3

3270
01:54:27,448 --> 01:54:31,978
you should be just fine just water it on

3271
01:54:29,639 --> 01:54:33,989
in let it drain out once it's done

3272
01:54:31,979 --> 01:54:35,939
draining take your pointer finger and

3273
01:54:33,988 --> 01:54:37,768
just make a little tiny hole just

3274
01:54:35,939 --> 01:54:39,900
knuckle deep just like I keep saying in

3275
01:54:37,769 --> 01:54:41,880
the episode I may name the episode that

3276
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:42,268
just go about one knuckle deep into the

3277
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,340
soil

3278
01:54:42,269 --> 01:54:47,130
then take your sealing and just set it

3279
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:48,869
right inside that hole then gently press

3280
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:50,219
the dirt right over that sealing just

3281
01:54:48,868 --> 01:54:52,319
real gently you don't need to pack it

3282
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:55,498
down just cover up that ceiling and then

3283
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:58,799
just let it rest and then within 24 to

3284
01:54:55,498 --> 01:55:00,688
48 for 36 maybe 72 hours you should see

3285
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,918
a little baby plant just popping up

3286
01:55:00,689 --> 01:55:03,809
right out of there you'll just see two

3287
01:55:01,918 --> 01:55:06,269
little green leaves just popping right

3288
01:55:03,809 --> 01:55:08,010
up out of that top soil I like to keep

3289
01:55:06,269 --> 01:55:10,168
my little baby plants in the beer cups

3290
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:11,969
under a t5 light I try to keep the light

3291
01:55:10,168 --> 01:55:13,380
kind of far and when they're little and

3292
01:55:11,969 --> 01:55:15,300
then as they get bigger I move the light

3293
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:17,130
a little bit closer I try not to let

3294
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,689
those seedlings get too stretchy if they

3295
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:20,880
start getting a little leggy I move the

3296
01:55:18,689 --> 01:55:21,989
light closer I like to put a fan on them

3297
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,309
while they're a little that gives them a

3298
01:55:21,988 --> 01:55:25,498
little strength makes them a little more

3299
01:55:23,309 --> 01:55:28,229
robust so there are advantages and

3300
01:55:25,498 --> 01:55:30,418
disadvantages to starting them in the

3301
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:32,909
beer cup the advantage they're already

3302
01:55:30,418 --> 01:55:34,349
in their soil you don't have to up pot

3303
01:55:32,908 --> 01:55:35,269
them you don't have to transplant them

3304
01:55:34,349 --> 01:55:37,250
you don't have to do any

3305
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:39,500
damage to a little seedling the

3306
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:41,810
disadvantage is sometimes you just

3307
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:43,789
completely lose a seedling and a beer

3308
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,500
cup filled with soil sometimes they just

3309
01:55:43,789 --> 01:55:47,810
totally disappear sometimes they don't

3310
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:50,060
sprout at all and sometimes you totally

3311
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:52,490
drown them by trying to water so much

3312
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:55,460
soil so starting them in beer cups in

3313
01:55:52,489 --> 01:55:57,079
soil is a little trickier but it may be

3314
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:59,300
the only option for some people not

3315
01:55:57,079 --> 01:56:01,489
everybody is able to order rapid rooters

3316
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:04,070
or root riot cubes not everybody has

3317
01:56:01,489 --> 01:56:05,719
access to a rock wool cube and some

3318
01:56:04,069 --> 01:56:08,269
people may just want to try it because

3319
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:10,520
that's the way it happens in nature so

3320
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:12,860
that is a rundown of my basic methods of

3321
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:15,530
germinating seeds hopefully one of those

3322
01:56:12,859 --> 01:56:17,899
methods works for you honestly I use the

3323
01:56:15,529 --> 01:56:19,670
folded paper towel method the most in a

3324
01:56:17,899 --> 01:56:21,829
commercial environment I may use the

3325
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:23,989
rapid Rooter method next but I honestly

3326
01:56:21,829 --> 01:56:24,619
do not start seeds directly in soil

3327
01:56:23,989 --> 01:56:26,569
anymore

3328
01:56:24,619 --> 01:56:28,579
I found that I can start a lot more in

3329
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:30,469
much less space by using the rapid

3330
01:56:28,579 --> 01:56:32,390
rooters imagine the amount of space it

3331
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:35,869
takes to start 100 rapid rooters

3332
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:37,460
compared to 100 beer cups it's a large

3333
01:56:35,869 --> 01:56:39,529
difference in the amount of space that

3334
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:41,029
you need I honestly don't have any

3335
01:56:39,529 --> 01:56:42,739
experience with the jiffy cubes I've

3336
01:56:41,029 --> 01:56:44,960
never had to use those I've always had

3337
01:56:42,739 --> 01:56:46,340
access to the rapid rooters and honestly

3338
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,770
I've just been sticking with a paper

3339
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:51,560
towel method so that's what I'm doing

3340
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:53,720
the most I encourage you to use the

3341
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:56,300
method that works the best for you I

3342
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:57,560
encourage you also to try different

3343
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:59,600
methods if you think something works

3344
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:01,130
great why not try another method if

3345
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:03,740
you've got some seeds that you can spare

3346
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:06,319
why not try something you may find that

3347
01:57:03,739 --> 01:57:08,300
something works better for you all right

3348
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:10,250
so now we've got our seeds germinated

3349
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:12,140
we've either got some seeds folded into

3350
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:14,539
a paper towel or we've got a rapid

3351
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:16,250
Rooter or a root riot or a rock wall

3352
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:18,649
cube with roots hanging out of the

3353
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:21,470
bottom of the root cube our next step is

3354
01:57:18,649 --> 01:57:26,119
to pot our new seedling into a pot of

3355
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:28,730
soil or soilless mix in this episode I

3356
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:32,229
will cover how to pot the seeds

3357
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:35,389
germinated from a paper towel into soil

3358
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:37,669
but my next episode is going to be about

3359
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:40,640
cutting clones then shortly after that

3360
01:57:37,670 --> 01:57:42,829
we will have to pop the clones into soil

3361
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:45,800
which means I'm going to do a combo

3362
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:46,689
episode of planting our new seedlings in

3363
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:49,269
the rapid route

3364
01:57:46,689 --> 01:57:51,519
and planting clones in rapid rooters

3365
01:57:49,269 --> 01:57:53,650
into soil at the same time I'm just

3366
01:57:51,519 --> 01:57:56,050
gonna knock that out in one episode so

3367
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:58,179
that part will be coming soon but for

3368
01:57:56,050 --> 01:58:00,309
now let's talk about planting our

3369
01:57:58,179 --> 01:58:02,918
freshly germinated seedlings that are

3370
01:58:00,309 --> 01:58:04,719
just sitting in a wet paper towel I like

3371
01:58:02,918 --> 01:58:06,668
to catch these seeds when the new tap

3372
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,050
roots are very sure I don't like to get

3373
01:58:06,668 --> 01:58:10,269
it too long and too out of control

3374
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:12,458
because I feel like that gives me too

3375
01:58:10,269 --> 01:58:15,039
much opportunity to cause it too much

3376
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:16,929
stress so as soon as I see my seedlings

3377
01:58:15,038 --> 01:58:18,219
crack open a little bit and that little

3378
01:58:16,929 --> 01:58:20,469
tap root is sticking out just a little

3379
01:58:18,219 --> 01:58:23,859
tiny bit I'm comfortable putting them

3380
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:26,439
into their soil or soilless mix and I do

3381
01:58:23,859 --> 01:58:28,179
that with a very similar method as I did

3382
01:58:26,439 --> 01:58:31,059
earlier when we talked about planting

3383
01:58:28,179 --> 01:58:33,550
seeds into the beer cups I get a beer

3384
01:58:31,059 --> 01:58:36,309
cup or a very small pot with plenty of

3385
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:38,498
drainage I fill it with a quality soil

3386
01:58:36,309 --> 01:58:40,329
that is good for small plants something

3387
01:58:38,498 --> 01:58:42,908
with a lot of aeration and plenty of

3388
01:58:40,328 --> 01:58:46,808
drainage then I moisten that soil with

3389
01:58:42,908 --> 01:58:48,158
water pH around 6 to 6 3 then I do the

3390
01:58:46,809 --> 01:58:50,199
same thing as we've been doing the whole

3391
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:53,319
episode I make a little tiny hole about

3392
01:58:50,198 --> 01:58:56,828
knuckle deep in that soil then I simply

3393
01:58:53,319 --> 01:58:59,558
place the germinated seed in that little

3394
01:58:56,828 --> 01:59:01,179
hole I do my best to point it with that

3395
01:58:59,559 --> 01:59:04,208
little white root pointing straight down

3396
01:59:01,179 --> 01:59:06,069
if your tap root is nice and short don't

3397
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:08,139
worry about which direction your ceiling

3398
01:59:06,069 --> 01:59:10,268
is facing when you place it into soil it

3399
01:59:08,139 --> 01:59:12,400
should be just fine if it's really long

3400
01:59:10,269 --> 01:59:14,860
you may want to make sure you point that

3401
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:16,828
root down and the seed is going up so

3402
01:59:14,859 --> 01:59:19,118
gently place your seedling in the soil

3403
01:59:16,828 --> 01:59:20,859
brush dirt over the top of it you don't

3404
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:22,899
need to bury it or pack it down just

3405
01:59:20,859 --> 01:59:25,058
cover it and then the tap root will go

3406
01:59:22,899 --> 01:59:26,948
down it'll start to spread out and the

3407
01:59:25,059 --> 01:59:29,079
little tiny plant will grow up to the

3408
01:59:26,948 --> 01:59:31,029
top and it'll push the seedling with a

3409
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:32,679
little set of tiny tiny leaves right

3410
01:59:31,029 --> 01:59:35,438
through the topsoil and you'll have a

3411
01:59:32,679 --> 01:59:36,939
little starter baby plant the main thing

3412
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:39,668
to worry about when potting your new

3413
01:59:36,939 --> 01:59:41,650
seedlings is to not damage that little

3414
01:59:39,668 --> 01:59:42,099
white tap root sticking out of the

3415
01:59:41,649 --> 01:59:44,859
seedling

3416
01:59:42,099 --> 01:59:47,168
do your best not to disrupt stress or

3417
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:49,299
damage that little white tap root

3418
01:59:47,168 --> 01:59:51,609
they're very delicate so once I've got

3419
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:53,199
it potted I put it under a t5 light I

3420
01:59:51,609 --> 01:59:55,268
keep the light a little distance away so

3421
01:59:53,198 --> 01:59:56,828
that I don't shock the plant as the

3422
01:59:55,269 --> 01:59:58,630
plant gets bigger I bring the light a

3423
01:59:56,828 --> 02:00:00,229
little bit closer once I feel like the

3424
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:02,480
plant is kind of taken off I put

3425
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:04,789
fan on it and then once it gets its

3426
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:08,959
first set of serrated leaves I start

3427
02:00:04,789 --> 02:00:11,300
adding very light doses of nutrients so

3428
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,250
that is how I pop my ceiling

3429
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:15,650
it was germinated from a paper towel I

3430
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:18,470
basically fill a beer cup with good dirt

3431
02:00:15,649 --> 02:00:20,329
poke a hole in the bottom go knuckle

3432
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:22,039
deep in the soil on the top drop my

3433
02:00:20,329 --> 02:00:24,079
little germinated seedling in there and

3434
02:00:22,039 --> 02:00:26,359
cover it up and then put it under the

3435
02:00:24,079 --> 02:00:28,850
light and wait for it to pop up and then

3436
02:00:26,359 --> 02:00:31,009
it grows and grows until I see a set of

3437
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:33,260
leaves with serration and that is when I

3438
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:35,449
start feeding it a little bit of light

3439
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:38,150
nutrients now let's talk about a couple

3440
02:00:35,449 --> 02:00:41,569
of things that happen quite often when

3441
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:44,000
we are working with seeds sometimes the

3442
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:46,429
seed shell will get stuck to the seed

3443
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,159
and hinder the seeds growth and threaten

3444
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:51,140
that seeds life but it's not as scary as

3445
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:52,609
it looks when it happens you'll know

3446
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:55,039
what I'm talking about that seed hole

3447
02:00:52,609 --> 02:00:56,689
will just get stuck the the sealing will

3448
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:58,579
come up out of the dirt and you'll see

3449
02:00:56,689 --> 02:01:00,169
that seed the leaves are trying to open

3450
02:00:58,579 --> 02:01:01,488
up it's trying to live and it's just

3451
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:03,920
trying to open up but it can't because

3452
02:01:01,488 --> 02:01:06,500
that seed casing is just stuck to it it

3453
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:08,840
is really easy to solve I get a spray

3454
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,000
bottle with water and I moisten that

3455
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,770
ceiling really heavily just spray it

3456
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,510
with water just keep spraying it more

3457
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:16,940
moisture more moisture more moisture

3458
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:18,470
then see if you can just brush it off

3459
02:01:16,939 --> 02:01:21,349
with your finger it may just come right

3460
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:23,480
off if not spray more water if that

3461
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:25,820
still doesn't work get some tweezers and

3462
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:27,769
just do a gentle dissection if it is

3463
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:29,689
really moist you should be able to get

3464
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:32,180
that seed casing off it is supposed to

3465
02:01:29,689 --> 02:01:34,309
come off of there that plant opens up

3466
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:35,840
the way the plant opens itself up the

3467
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:37,460
way that that seed casing spreads in

3468
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:39,319
half it should pop right off of there

3469
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:41,659
just give it a little assistance a

3470
02:01:39,319 --> 02:01:43,130
little moisture little tweezers maybe a

3471
02:01:41,659 --> 02:01:44,809
pair of chopsticks depending on how

3472
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:46,789
skilled you are it shouldn't be too hard

3473
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:49,340
to do don't be afraid to get in there

3474
02:01:46,789 --> 02:01:51,529
and pull that casing off earlier I

3475
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:54,470
talked about not using heat mat I have

3476
02:01:51,529 --> 02:01:55,279
honestly seen people roast more seeds

3477
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:57,380
with heat mats

3478
02:01:55,279 --> 02:02:00,139
than I've ever seen success with the

3479
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:02,060
heat mat from a seedling the only time I

3480
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:04,400
have ever needed a heat mat was when I

3481
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:06,680
was growing in a warehouse in Colorado

3482
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:09,229
and it was really cold during the winter

3483
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:11,360
other times I don't use the heat mat for

3484
02:02:09,229 --> 02:02:13,979
cloning or for seedlings and I have

3485
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:16,109
great success if you were comfortable in

3486
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:18,299
the area your seedlings are probably

3487
02:02:16,109 --> 02:02:20,639
comfortable in that area also and I'm

3488
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:22,050
not talking about some Colorado mountain

3489
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,789
boy who's outside barefoot in the snow

3490
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:26,100
I'm talking about a normal person room

3491
02:02:23,789 --> 02:02:28,289
temperature is acceptable for your

3492
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,820
seedlings now I've got one more thing I

3493
02:02:28,289 --> 02:02:31,890
want to touch on before I start wrapping

3494
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:34,979
up the episode and the note I wrote is

3495
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:37,619
called pre-soak a lot of people like to

3496
02:02:34,979 --> 02:02:40,079
pre-soak their seeds before the official

3497
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:41,369
germination if you've got older seeds

3498
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:43,559
that have been sitting around for a

3499
02:02:41,369 --> 02:02:46,019
longer I meant may recommend you give

3500
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,720
them a pre-soak it's really easy you

3501
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:51,090
simply pre soak them in water before you

3502
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:53,850
germinate them I recommend 12 hours

3503
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:56,190
maybe 24 at the most never go more than

3504
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:58,860
24 hours on a soak because that will

3505
02:02:56,189 --> 02:03:01,379
drown your seeds my theory behind the

3506
02:02:58,859 --> 02:03:03,149
pre-soak is some seeds just have a hard

3507
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:05,369
outer coating and they don't want to

3508
02:03:03,149 --> 02:03:07,889
germinate very easily soaking them in

3509
02:03:05,369 --> 02:03:10,019
water for 24 hours will definitely

3510
02:03:07,890 --> 02:03:12,300
soften that outer coating and encourage

3511
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:13,770
easier germination so if you've got

3512
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:15,420
older seeds that you've been having a

3513
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:17,790
problem getting to germinate

3514
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:19,529
maybe soak them for 12 hours then give

3515
02:03:17,789 --> 02:03:21,840
them the paper towel method if that

3516
02:03:19,529 --> 02:03:23,639
doesn't work try soaking some for 24

3517
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,739
hours then giving them the paper towel

3518
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:27,810
method if that doesn't work then we're

3519
02:03:25,738 --> 02:03:29,609
going to need to try more scientific

3520
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:31,530
approaches there are chemicals we can

3521
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:34,170
add there are tricks we can do but that

3522
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:36,359
is much more advanced science than what

3523
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:37,890
we're prepared for today so if you've

3524
02:03:36,359 --> 02:03:39,509
got old seeds or if you feel like you've

3525
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:41,430
got really hard seeds with the really

3526
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:44,520
thick coating don't be afraid to give

3527
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:46,140
them a pre-soak 12 to 24 hours never go

3528
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,280
more than 24 hours I don't feel like

3529
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:49,020
that's a good idea

3530
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:51,000
all right you guys I feel like that is a

3531
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,370
good lesson on how to germinate your

3532
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,680
seeds I will not forget to teach you

3533
02:03:53,369 --> 02:03:57,449
guys how to pot those freshly sprouted

3534
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:59,909
seeds that you've got in your rapid

3535
02:03:57,449 --> 02:04:01,979
rooters or your rock wool cubes like I

3536
02:03:59,909 --> 02:04:03,689
told you not to do or in your jiffy pots

3537
02:04:01,979 --> 02:04:06,299
will talk about that in a future episode

3538
02:04:03,689 --> 02:04:08,129
that is written down that is on the

3539
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:10,199

gigantic dab of star dog ambrosia from

3597

apothecary farms I always love the

3598
02:06:16,908 --> 02:06:20,808
flavor of the star dog I love the effect

3599
02:06:19,038 --> 02:06:22,849
of the star dog and the folks at

3600

star dog ambrosia extracts alright you

3603
02:06:27,769 --> 02:06:30,530
guys this is going to be another grow

3604
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:32,689
lesson if you've been following along

3605
02:06:30,529 --> 02:06:34,819
I've been doing a long series of grow

3606
02:06:32,689 --> 02:06:36,649
lessons in this lesson we are going to

3607
02:06:34,819 --> 02:06:38,719
talk about cutting clones we're going to

3608
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:40,820
cut clones into rapid rooters we will

3609
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:41,179
cut clones for use and an easy cloning

3610
02:06:40,819 --> 02:06:42,979
machine

3611
02:06:41,179 --> 02:06:45,469
and we will also talk briefly about

3612
02:06:42,979 --> 02:06:47,539
cutting clones directly into cups of

3613
02:06:45,469 --> 02:06:49,579
soil I feel like I have a lot of

3614
02:06:47,539 --> 02:06:51,019
detailed information written down so

3615
02:06:49,579 --> 02:06:53,179
let's not waste a lot of time with the

3616
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:55,340
long intro let's get right into a grow

3617
02:06:53,179 --> 02:06:57,590
lesson let's talk about cutting clones I

3618
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:59,569
think a good spot to start talking about

3619
02:06:57,590 --> 02:07:01,789
cutting clones is beginning with healthy

3620
02:06:59,569 --> 02:07:04,519
mother plants you need a healthy donor

3621
02:07:01,789 --> 02:07:07,219
plant to have a healthy clone I suggest

3622
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:09,230
you listen to episode 315 and learn all

3623
02:07:07,219 --> 02:07:11,179
about healthy mother plants so if you've

3624
02:07:09,229 --> 02:07:12,408
listened to episode 315 or if you feel

3625
02:07:11,179 --> 02:07:15,140
like you are up to speed and you have

3626
02:07:12,408 --> 02:07:18,019
healthy veggie mother plants let's get

3627
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:20,060
into a lesson on cutting clones let's

3628
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:22,400
talk briefly about why we take clones

3629
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,960
why do I want to cut a clone from a

3630
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:26,689
healthy plant that is a really good

3631
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:29,329
question first off I suggest you cut a

3632
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:31,219
clone from every new plant you grow have

3633
02:07:29,329 --> 02:07:33,109
a clone if you've got the opportunity to

3634
02:07:31,219 --> 02:07:35,510
cut a clone and keep a clone in another

3635
02:07:33,109 --> 02:07:37,369
veg space I always recommend that you

3636
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:38,719
may get a pack of seeds you may grow

3637
02:07:37,369 --> 02:07:40,789
that pack of seeds and find it the most

3638
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:42,469
amazing plant in that pack of seeds and

3639
02:07:40,789 --> 02:07:44,929
if you did not take a clone guess what

3640
02:07:42,469 --> 02:07:47,300
it's gone you can't grow that again the

3641
02:07:44,929 --> 02:07:49,789
advantage to cutting clones is if you do

3642
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:51,800
find a keeper in a pack of seeds you can

3643
02:07:49,789 --> 02:07:53,510
grow that same keeper over and over

3644
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:55,460
again if you have taken a clone you have

3645
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:55,880
reliable tested genetics you know it's a

3646
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:57,560
female

3647
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:58,909
you know it's potent you know it tastes

3648
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:01,159
good and you know it grows the way you

3649
02:07:58,908 --> 02:08:03,469
want it to grow so that's the main point

3650
02:08:01,158 --> 02:08:05,988
of taking a clone from any type of plant

3651
02:08:03,469 --> 02:08:08,270
you are getting a reproduction of the

3652
02:08:05,988 --> 02:08:10,158
plant you are familiar with so we take a

3653
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:11,929
clone then you can either grow out that

3654
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:14,149
clone or you can create a mother plant

3655
02:08:11,929 --> 02:08:15,649
from that clone and take multiple clones

3656
02:08:14,149 --> 02:08:18,738
from that plant and fill your grow room

3657
02:08:15,649 --> 02:08:20,569
or rooms with that same cultivar over

3658
02:08:18,738 --> 02:08:24,049
and over again and have repeatable

3659
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:26,569
reliable results with that clone seeds

3660
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:28,640
do show variation we try to narrow down

3661
02:08:26,569 --> 02:08:30,889
the variation in seeds through breeding

3662
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:32,719
but that does take time if you're

3663
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:34,610
growing from clones you know you are

3664
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:36,649
going to have exact copies if you take a

3665
02:08:34,609 --> 02:08:38,000
hundred clones off of one plant and you

3666
02:08:36,649 --> 02:08:40,129
put those all in a grow room they are

3667
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,079
all going to act exactly the same you

3668
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:43,579
shouldn't see any variation in there so

3669
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:46,039
that is the point and the purpose and

3670
02:08:43,579 --> 02:08:48,050
the advantage of growing with clones and

3671
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:50,149
why we want to learn how to take clones

3672
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:51,590
now I know somebody out there listening

3673
02:08:50,149 --> 02:08:52,679
is going to bring up the subject of

3674
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:54,739
genetic drift

3675
02:08:52,679 --> 02:08:57,060
I suggest you take a listen to episode

3676
02:08:54,738 --> 02:08:58,829
343 of the girl from your heart podcast

3677
02:08:57,060 --> 02:09:02,190
and you will hear my full opinion of

3678
02:08:58,829 --> 02:09:04,170
genetic drift in this episode I'm going

3679
02:09:02,189 --> 02:09:06,869
to cover three common methods for

3680
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:09,060
cutting clones in all three of those

3681
02:09:06,869 --> 02:09:11,789
methods one of the most important things

3682
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:14,070
we can think about is cleanliness of the

3683
02:09:11,789 --> 02:09:16,079
plants and cleanliness of our tools and

3684
02:09:14,069 --> 02:09:18,448
cleanliness of our environment

3685
02:09:16,079 --> 02:09:19,948
cleanliness is very important when

3686
02:09:18,448 --> 02:09:22,408
cutting clones think of it this way

3687
02:09:19,948 --> 02:09:24,629
we're taking a plant we're taking

3688
02:09:22,408 --> 02:09:26,939
something sharp we are cutting that

3689
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:29,489
plant we are severing a limb from our

3690
02:09:26,939 --> 02:09:32,250
plant hopefully the tool used was clean

3691
02:09:29,488 --> 02:09:34,829
and sanitized hopefully that plant was

3692
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:36,750
pests and pathogens free hopefully you

3693
02:09:34,829 --> 02:09:38,698
were wearing gloves so we have just made

3694
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:40,529
a fresh cut in a plant we've got a plant

3695
02:09:38,698 --> 02:09:42,359
with a cut in it we've got a fresh cut

3696
02:09:40,529 --> 02:09:43,800
with an open wound at the bottom of it

3697
02:09:42,359 --> 02:09:45,658
we have a lot of opportunity for

3698
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,219
infection or pathogen to enter this

3699
02:09:45,658 --> 02:09:49,469
plant at this point keep your

3700
02:09:47,219 --> 02:09:52,289
environment clean now everywhere you set

3701
02:09:49,469 --> 02:09:54,239
that clone needs to be clean the product

3702
02:09:52,289 --> 02:09:56,340
you dip that clone into needs to be

3703
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:57,988
clean and contaminant free so when

3704
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:59,520
you're pouring out your dipping gel your

3705
02:09:57,988 --> 02:10:01,738
clone x gel or whatever you choose to

3706
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,360
use don't dip your clones directly into

3707
02:10:01,738 --> 02:10:05,428
the container pour out about a shot

3708
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:07,079
glass worth at a time and dip your fresh

3709
02:10:05,429 --> 02:10:09,029
cuts into there before you stick them

3710
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:11,039
that is my recommendation to keep some

3711
02:10:09,029 --> 02:10:12,840
sanitation going through the grow so

3712
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:14,698
every step of cloning we need to think

3713
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:16,619
about cleanliness cleanliness is very

3714
02:10:14,698 --> 02:10:18,719
important clean out your cloning trays

3715
02:10:16,619 --> 02:10:21,179
before you use them clean your cloner

3716
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:22,890
before you use it clean your clone plugs

3717
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:24,719
even if you just bought them rinse them

3718
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:28,909
off those neoprene collars give them a

3719
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,908
nice rinse if you're using permaculture

3720
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:41,309
and over again with no problems clean

3721
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:43,710
every part of the cloning process think

3722
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:47,100
about it this way we are basically

3723
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:49,380
performing major surgery on our cannabis

3724
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:51,600
plants would you want to be in that

3725
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:53,670
environment with your arm severed would

3726
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:55,739
you trust me in your clone room to say I

3727
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:57,480
got it bro and grab whatever scissors

3728
02:10:55,738 --> 02:11:00,178
you use to cut the clone I'm gonna cut

3729
02:10:57,479 --> 02:11:02,099
your arm with off with that okay then

3730
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:03,989
I'm gonna set your arm wherever you put

3731
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:05,130
the clones after you chop them you cut a

3732
02:11:03,988 --> 02:11:06,448
bunch of clones and then you set them

3733
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:06,679
down somewhere until you get a chance to

3734
02:11:06,448 --> 02:11:07,849
do

3735
02:11:06,679 --> 02:11:09,890
and stick them because they can't all go

3736
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:11,989
at once wherever you set those clones I

3737
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:13,250
want to set your severed arm how do you

3738
02:11:11,988 --> 02:11:15,769
feel about that are you okay with that

3739
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:17,390
is it that clean then I want to dip your

3740
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:18,679
severed arm into some clone gel we're

3741
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:20,270
not gonna clone your arm are gonna stop

3742
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:22,789
there but I want your mind to think

3743
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:24,260
about that level of cleanliness also are

3744
02:11:22,789 --> 02:11:26,149
you comfortable running around with that

3745
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:27,770
severed arm in that grow environment is

3746
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:30,259
it clean enough or you looking around

3747
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:32,480
going I'm gonna get some dirty [ __ ] in

3748
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:34,340
this stump think about that in your

3749
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:36,738
cloning environment clean it up it

3750
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:39,350
doesn't take that long get a broom get a

3751
02:11:36,738 --> 02:11:41,119
mop clean some [ __ ] up the process of

3752
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:43,370
cutting clones will give your plants a

3753
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:45,289
lot of opportunity to pick up problems

3754
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:47,539
this is where we see people pick up

3755
02:11:45,289 --> 02:11:50,719
problems that they later try to identify

3756
02:11:47,539 --> 02:11:51,979
as genetic drift so wear gloves clean

3757
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:55,369
your tools clean all of your equipment

3758
02:11:51,979 --> 02:11:57,169
use fresh neoprene if you're not using /

3759
02:11:55,369 --> 02:11:58,880
mcclellan collars you need to replace

3760
02:11:57,170 --> 02:12:00,920
them every time don't try to reuse those

3761
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:02,750
cheapos they have a lot of space in

3762
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:04,130
there where things can build up the

3763
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:05,569
perma clone collars are made out of a

3764
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:07,520
different product you can clean them

3765
02:12:05,569 --> 02:12:09,920
don't try to reuse the cheapos please

3766
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,840
you will get problems clean everything

3767
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:14,149
that is my point let's move forward from

3768
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:17,239
talking about cleanliness let's talk

3769
02:12:14,149 --> 02:12:19,789
about the actual procedure for cutting

3770
02:12:17,238 --> 02:12:21,738
clones the two methods I use most

3771
02:12:19,789 --> 02:12:23,840
commonly in a commercial grow

3772
02:12:21,738 --> 02:12:26,779
environment or in my own personal grows

3773
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,940
are cutting into rapid rooters or using

3774
02:12:26,779 --> 02:12:30,649
ez cloners or the botanic air turbo

3775
02:12:28,939 --> 02:12:33,229
cloner machines when I talk about the EZ

3776
02:12:30,649 --> 02:12:35,210
corner or the turbo corner I will

3777
02:12:33,229 --> 02:12:37,250
probably say ez cloner all the time I

3778
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:39,679
mean the same thing they're both very

3779
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:42,260
similar machines so let's talk about

3780
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:44,719
cutting clones first into rapid rooters

3781
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:46,369
this is a very common method it's very

3782
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:49,670
cost effective and it does not require

3783
02:12:46,369 --> 02:12:52,488
an expensive machine so let's get right

3784
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:55,640
into it cutting clones in rapid rooters

3785
02:12:52,488 --> 02:12:58,729
step 1 soak the rapid Rooter plugs in a

3786
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:01,159
week but pH balanced nutrient solution

3787
02:12:58,729 --> 02:13:03,829
if you're using bottled nutrients you

3788
02:13:01,158 --> 02:13:06,559
can use your veg nutrients at about a

3789
02:13:03,829 --> 02:13:08,750
quarter strength for your clones so fill

3790
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,730
up a gallon container of water pour in a

3791
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:14,060
quarter strength worth of nutrients and

3792
02:13:10,729 --> 02:13:16,009
then adjust the pH between 5/8 and 6.0

3793
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:17,570
no I usually get the tray with the whole

3794
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:19,429
setup that's got the little spots for

3795
02:13:17,569 --> 02:13:20,000
those plugs to go so I've got a little

3796
02:13:19,429 --> 02:13:21,289
spot

3797
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,300
them stood up if you don't want to buy

3798
02:13:21,289 --> 02:13:25,519
the whole tray you don't have to do that

3799
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:27,470
many clones but it's a lot easier I find

3800
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:30,140
filling the whole tray keeps the

3801
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:32,030
moisture level easier to control inside

3802
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:34,490
of the dome we'll talk about that in a

3803
02:13:32,029 --> 02:13:36,259
little bit so you soak your plugs then

3804
02:13:34,489 --> 02:13:38,539
you put all of those plugs in the tray I

3805
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:40,190
put all 50 of them in the tray then once

3806
02:13:38,539 --> 02:13:43,310
all 50 of them are in there now it is

3807
02:13:40,189 --> 02:13:45,199
time to go and cut our clones I like to

3808
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:47,539
cut clones from a few different parts of

3809
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:50,000
the plant when I'm topping my plants I

3810
02:13:47,539 --> 02:13:52,039
quite often make clones from that super

3811
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,470
healthy fat top of the plant those make

3812
02:13:52,039 --> 02:13:56,630
beautiful clones if I've already cut the

3813
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:58,640
top out I also make clones from when I

3814
02:13:56,630 --> 02:14:00,500
lollipop when you go clean off the

3815
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:02,960
bottoms of the plants I usually clean up

3816
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:04,760
the bottom 6 or 8 maybe 10 or 12 inches

3817
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:06,829
depending on the size of the plant those

3818
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:09,650
bottom branches those make beautiful

3819
02:14:06,829 --> 02:14:11,300
clones you can take your clone from any

3820
02:14:09,649 --> 02:14:12,949
part of the plant as long as it is

3821
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:14,690
healthy and as long as you are happy

3822
02:14:12,949 --> 02:14:16,519
with removing that section of the plant

3823
02:14:14,689 --> 02:14:18,529
right before I flip my plants into

3824
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:20,450
flower I do a major cleanup anyway so

3825
02:14:18,529 --> 02:14:22,069
that's a good opportunity for me to get

3826
02:14:20,449 --> 02:14:24,769
clones off the bottom parts of those

3827
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:26,569
plants so try to cut your clones from

3828
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:29,150
the healthiest part of the plant take

3829
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:31,309
about a 5 to 8 inch cut off of your

3830
02:14:29,149 --> 02:14:33,829
mother plant and when you cut it try to

3831
02:14:31,310 --> 02:14:35,600
cut at a 45 degree angle we're gonna

3832
02:14:33,829 --> 02:14:36,829
talk a little bit about that 45 degree

3833
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:40,220
angle here in just a couple of minutes

3834
02:14:36,829 --> 02:14:41,809
now always always clean your scissors

3835
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:44,240
you guys clean your scissors with

3836
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:46,460
rubbing alcohol and when you change

3837
02:14:44,239 --> 02:14:47,899
mother plants if you cut 20 clones off

3838
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:49,310
of this mother plant and then you decide

3839
02:14:47,899 --> 02:14:51,949
to cut clones off of another mother

3840
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:53,330
plant clean your scissors between plants

3841
02:14:51,949 --> 02:14:55,250
earlier we talked about this being just

3842
02:14:53,329 --> 02:14:56,840
like surgery you wouldn't use the same

3843
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:58,880
scissors on different patients you don't

3844
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:00,680
want to spread disease that's the exact

3845
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:04,010
same reason why we want to clean our

3846
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:06,140
scissors between mother plants now when

3847
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:07,730
I'm cutting clones I try to take a small

3848
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:09,740
cup with a little bit of water with

3849
02:15:07,729 --> 02:15:11,659
nutrient solution in it and I take as

3850
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:13,579
many cuttings as I need at one time and

3851
02:15:11,659 --> 02:15:15,170
fill that cup and then take that cup

3852
02:15:13,579 --> 02:15:17,059
back to my cloning station I don't go

3853
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:18,529
cut a clone then take that back to the

3854
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:19,100
station and then go cut another one and

3855
02:15:18,529 --> 02:15:20,989
then take it back

3856
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:22,910
I'll go get as many as I need if I need

3857
02:15:20,989 --> 02:15:25,010
50 I'll go find 50 good clones of one

3858
02:15:22,909 --> 02:15:26,750
strain then I head back to the clone

3859
02:15:25,010 --> 02:15:28,489
station I clean them up I dip them and I

3860
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:29,989
stick them then I can put the dome on

3861
02:15:28,489 --> 02:15:31,429
and then I can leave them alone for a

3862
02:15:29,989 --> 02:15:33,309
few days that I'll have to keep walking

3863
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:34,659
back and forth between each cut

3864
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:36,100
have to worry about the plants wilting

3865
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:37,599
because the dome isn't on I don't have

3866
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:39,789
to keep taking the dome off and on

3867
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:41,620
trying to rescue plants it's much more

3868
02:15:39,789 --> 02:15:43,210
efficient and gentler on the plants to

3869
02:15:41,619 --> 02:15:44,769
go take all of our cuts and then head

3870
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:47,500
back to the clone station and work on

3871
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:49,660
all of them at once so I've taken all of

3872
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:52,149
my cuttings and I'm back at the clone

3873
02:15:49,659 --> 02:15:53,670
station now I'm gonna take each cutting

3874
02:15:52,149 --> 02:15:56,199
it's about five to eight inches long

3875
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:59,350
depending on the genetics and the

3876
02:15:56,199 --> 02:16:01,000
stretchiness of that plant on a five to

3877
02:15:59,350 --> 02:16:02,980
eight inch cutting you may have one or

3878
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,380
two little side nodes sticking off of it

3879
02:16:02,979 --> 02:16:06,909
but at the top we've got that fresh new

3880
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:09,100
growth coming right out of the top and

3881
02:16:06,909 --> 02:16:10,449
then there are those two main leaves

3882
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:12,730
coming right out of the top of that

3883
02:16:10,449 --> 02:16:15,159
branch we basically want to remove

3884
02:16:12,729 --> 02:16:17,289
everything from our clone other than

3885
02:16:15,159 --> 02:16:18,670
those two top leaves and that new parts

3886
02:16:17,289 --> 02:16:21,159
sticking out of the top we don't need

3887
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:23,289
much more than that less is more when it

3888
02:16:21,159 --> 02:16:25,000
comes to taking clones in a rapid Rooter

3889
02:16:23,289 --> 02:16:26,680
we don't need a lot of material to get

3890
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,329
started once you get more experienced at

3891
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:30,280
it once you get better you may be able

3892
02:16:28,329 --> 02:16:32,799
to take larger clones but smaller clones

3893
02:16:30,279 --> 02:16:34,750
are easier in this type of setup so all

3894
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:36,489
we really need is those top two leaves

3895
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:37,899
and that new fresh part coming right out

3896
02:16:36,489 --> 02:16:39,909
of the top there's nothing really there

3897
02:16:37,899 --> 02:16:41,590
to sustain life in this clone so we

3898
02:16:39,909 --> 02:16:42,879
don't need to give it a lot of stuff to

3899
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:44,860
try to keep alive we don't need to

3900
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:46,569
burden this plant by having a whole

3901
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:48,880
bunch of extra leaves and extra little

3902
02:16:46,569 --> 02:16:50,229
side branches so just those top two plus

3903
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:51,069
the new stuff coming out is all we need

3904
02:16:50,229 --> 02:16:53,859
clean that all up

3905
02:16:51,069 --> 02:16:56,289
I generally cut those two top leaves I

3906
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:58,270
trim them quite a bit so think about it

3907
02:16:56,290 --> 02:17:00,610
this way the leaf is oval shape it

3908
02:16:58,270 --> 02:17:02,260
starts off real skinny it gets wider it

3909
02:17:00,610 --> 02:17:04,510
gets wider and then at some point it

3910
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:06,489
starts to taper back in right where it

3911
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:08,500
tapers in is where I cut that leaf tip

3912
02:17:06,489 --> 02:17:10,360
off so right at the widest part of that

3913
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:12,280
leaf I just cut it right off so now I've

3914
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:13,540
got a little stalk with these two leaves

3915
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:15,070
that have been trimmed up and then this

3916
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:16,960
was a little fresh part coming right out

3917
02:17:15,069 --> 02:17:19,090
of the top of it there's not a lot there

3918
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:21,399
but that is much easier for us to

3919
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:23,500
sustain than a big plant in a clone dome

3920
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:24,819
so now I've got this little stick with

3921
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:26,620
these trimmed up little leaves with this

3922
02:17:24,819 --> 02:17:28,449
fresh growth coming out of the top now

3923
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:30,310
at the very bottom of that when we cut

3924
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:31,630
it off we should have cut at a 45 degree

3925
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:33,579
angle if you didn't make a nice

3926
02:17:31,629 --> 02:17:35,348
45-degree angle when you originally cut

3927
02:17:33,579 --> 02:17:39,010
it go ahead and make the bottom of that

3928
02:17:35,349 --> 02:17:40,960
stem a nice 45 degree angle now the next

3929
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:43,210
thing I do is use a razor blade to

3930
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:45,009
gently scrape the edge of my clone

3931
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:46,379
anything that's going to be submerged

3932
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:49,139
into the rapid root

3933
02:17:46,379 --> 02:17:50,848
I gently very gently give it a scrape I

3934
02:17:49,138 --> 02:17:53,278
just want to take off that very top

3935
02:17:50,849 --> 02:17:55,139
layer just disrupting the very outside

3936
02:17:53,279 --> 02:17:56,639
layer of that clone so that it will kind

3937
02:17:55,138 --> 02:17:58,768
of break that skin and give it an

3938
02:17:56,638 --> 02:18:01,738
opportunity to root a little more so I

3939
02:17:58,769 --> 02:18:03,779
give it a very very light scraping all

3940
02:18:01,738 --> 02:18:05,968
the clone that is going to be dipped

3941
02:18:03,779 --> 02:18:08,399
into the rapid Rooter will get just a

3942
02:18:05,968 --> 02:18:09,928
very light scraping don't overdo it if

3943
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:11,368
you see the white part of the plant

3944
02:18:09,929 --> 02:18:13,349
you've gone too deep you just want to

3945
02:18:11,369 --> 02:18:15,689
kind of disrupt the outer layer of the

3946
02:18:13,349 --> 02:18:17,579
plant so I just take a razor blade

3947
02:18:15,689 --> 02:18:19,529
sometimes I even use my cloning scissors

3948
02:18:17,579 --> 02:18:21,148
and I just rough up that edge just a

3949
02:18:19,529 --> 02:18:22,859
little bit you'll see the outer layer is

3950
02:18:21,148 --> 02:18:24,510
a little bit of a different color than

3951
02:18:22,859 --> 02:18:26,609
the inside layer that's how you know

3952
02:18:24,510 --> 02:18:28,500
you're doing it properly again don't go

3953
02:18:26,609 --> 02:18:30,090
too far you can kill your clones by

3954
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:31,738
cutting too deep this way just give them

3955
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:33,568
a very little scrape if you want to skip

3956
02:18:31,738 --> 02:18:35,879
this step until you learn what you're

3957
02:18:33,568 --> 02:18:37,558
doing that is okay but this may speed

3958
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:39,688
you up just a little bit by breaking

3959
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:41,789
that outer layer of the fleshy plant

3960
02:18:39,689 --> 02:18:44,250
material so we've got a nice cleaned up

3961
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:45,840
plant we've cut a nice 45 degree angle

3962
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:47,398
we've kind of scraped it up a little bit

3963
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,380
to remove that outer skin to give it an

3964
02:18:47,398 --> 02:18:51,329
opportunity to root now we need to dip

3965
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:54,000
our fresh cutting into a rooting hormone

3966
02:18:51,329 --> 02:18:56,250
I've been doing my best to not recommend

3967
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,290
any specific brands or products but what

3968
02:18:56,250 --> 02:19:01,379
I have had the best experience with has

3969
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:02,939
been the purple clone X cloning gel that

3970
02:19:01,379 --> 02:19:04,858
works great for cutting clones into

3971
02:19:02,939 --> 02:19:07,318
rapid rooters it works great for cutting

3972
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:09,300
clones into rock wool cubes it works

3973
02:19:07,318 --> 02:19:11,398
perfectly for cutting clones into the ez

3974
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:13,349
clone machines and it also works well

3975
02:19:11,398 --> 02:19:15,118
for cutting clones directly into soil

3976
02:19:13,349 --> 02:19:17,579
I'll tell you right away that that

3977
02:19:15,119 --> 02:19:19,769
product is not organic and many people

3978
02:19:17,579 --> 02:19:21,359
will have opinions about that product I

3979
02:19:19,769 --> 02:19:23,040
am aware of what I'm using I've done the

3980
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:24,750
reading I've done the research and I

3981
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,309
know what is in there and I am okay with

3982
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:28,260
it you may want to do a little bit of

3983
02:19:26,308 --> 02:19:30,629
research when you were selecting your

3984
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:33,029
cloning hormones and since I'm on the

3985
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:35,579
subject always wear gloves when using

3986
02:19:33,029 --> 02:19:37,979
any type of cloning solution all right

3987
02:19:35,579 --> 02:19:39,898
so we've got our clone x gel or whatever

3988
02:19:37,978 --> 02:19:42,329
cloning solution you have chosen I

3989
02:19:39,898 --> 02:19:44,519
usually pour mine out of the container I

3990
02:19:42,329 --> 02:19:46,228
don't like to dip my clone directly into

3991
02:19:44,519 --> 02:19:47,939
that container if there is a problem

3992
02:19:46,228 --> 02:19:49,648
with my donor plant now I have just

3993
02:19:47,939 --> 02:19:51,449
dipped that dirty plant right into my

3994
02:19:49,648 --> 02:19:53,278
cloning solution and I plan on using

3995
02:19:51,449 --> 02:19:54,810
this cloning solution to make all of my

3996
02:19:53,279 --> 02:19:56,819
clones which means I'm going to set

3997
02:19:54,809 --> 02:19:59,398
myself up for failure from the very

3998
02:19:56,818 --> 02:19:59,909
beginning so pour your cloning solution

3999
02:19:59,398 --> 02:20:01,590
out of the

4000
02:19:59,909 --> 02:20:03,390
bottle into a smaller container I

4001
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:05,610
usually use a shot glass or something

4002
02:20:03,390 --> 02:20:07,229
similar whatever you choose to use don't

4003
02:20:05,610 --> 02:20:09,000
pour the leftovers back into the

4004
02:20:07,229 --> 02:20:11,369
container that defeats the whole purpose

4005
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,190
so pour out some cloning solution then

4006
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:16,530
simply dunk the fresh-cut end of your

4007
02:20:14,190 --> 02:20:17,790
new cutting into that cloning gel just

4008
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:21,120
stir it around so that he gathers a

4009
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:23,430
little bit then gently place that end

4010
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,500
right into that hole in the rapid Rooter

4011
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:27,090
don't press too hard if it bends or a

4012
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:28,590
kinks over you've broken it and you've

4013
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:30,149
killed that clone you've either got to

4014
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:32,310
cut that end off and start fresh or

4015
02:20:30,149 --> 02:20:34,949
start with the fresh cutting so gently

4016
02:20:32,310 --> 02:20:36,299
push that cutting into that plug but you

4017
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:37,860
don't want it to penetrate all the way

4018
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:39,329
through the bottom if it pokes out all

4019
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:40,680
the way through the bottom that end of

4020
02:20:39,329 --> 02:20:42,750
it is just gonna rot it's gonna turn

4021
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:44,370
black and die if you've buried your

4022
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:46,049
cutting too far under the Rooter it'll

4023
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:48,030
be okay just grab it and pull it right

4024
02:20:46,049 --> 02:20:49,829
on out just pull it real gently and back

4025
02:20:48,030 --> 02:20:51,870
it out just a little bit and it will be

4026
02:20:49,829 --> 02:20:53,700
fine so make sure you go deep enough

4027
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:55,530
into the root plug for the plant to grab

4028
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:57,210
and have some sort of life in there but

4029
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:59,400
don't go so far that it pokes all the

4030
02:20:57,209 --> 02:21:01,649
way through when we were planting seeds

4031
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:03,029
I taught you to only go knuckle deep you

4032
02:21:01,649 --> 02:21:04,709
may need to go a little deeper than that

4033
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:06,601
when you're sticking your cuttings into

4034
02:21:04,709 --> 02:21:08,819
the rapid rooters if you're using a

4035
02:21:06,601 --> 02:21:11,130
rapid Rooter or a root riot I recommend

4036
02:21:08,819 --> 02:21:13,260
you go about 3/4 of the way into the

4037
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:15,179
root plug so if they're an inch deep go

4038
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:17,550
three-quarters of an inch down into that

4039
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:18,930
plug and now you basically repeat that

4040
02:21:17,549 --> 02:21:22,049
process until you've got your desired

4041
02:21:18,930 --> 02:21:24,329
amount of clones cut dipped and stuck

4042
02:21:22,049 --> 02:21:26,489
into the cubes once I've got my tray

4043
02:21:24,329 --> 02:21:28,739
full I spray the inside of the dome I

4044
02:21:26,489 --> 02:21:30,930
close the vents of the dome I put that

4045
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:33,869
on the tray and then I set it underneath

4046
02:21:30,930 --> 02:21:36,420
a t5 light I like to put my t5 light

4047
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:39,030
about six to ten inches above my clone

4048
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:41,250
dome and I leave those lights on for 24

4049
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:43,290
hours a day you'll find it is much

4050
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:45,450
easier to control the environment around

4051
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:47,700
your clones if they don't have any

4052
02:21:45,450 --> 02:21:49,680
changes in light cycle every time the

4053
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:51,391
light goes on and the light goes off the

4054
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,040
temperature and the humidity will change

4055
02:21:51,390 --> 02:21:55,199
and you will change the environment in

4056
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:58,561
your clone dome your goal is to keep

4057
02:21:55,200 --> 02:22:00,120
your clones warm and moist and humid so

4058
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,649
by keeping the light on all of the time

4059
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:04,561
we're able to keep a consistent

4060
02:22:01,649 --> 02:22:06,719
environment inside of that dome so now

4061
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:08,279
we have got our fresh cuttings cleaned

4062
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:09,869
up we've got them dipped into cloning

4063
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:11,820
solution we've got them stuck into the

4064
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:13,380
rapid rooters we sprayed the inside of

4065
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:16,079
the dome we closed the vents on

4066
02:22:13,379 --> 02:22:17,728
dome we put the dome on the tray then we

4067
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:19,770
slid the whole clone set up underneath

4068
02:22:17,728 --> 02:22:22,409
the t5 light now here comes the hardest

4069
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:24,180
part the hard part is waiting you don't

4070
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:25,950
even need to check on your clones for

4071
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:28,110
three days if you've got the proper

4072
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:30,030
conditions as long as you see

4073
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:31,979
condensation on the inside of that dome

4074
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:34,890
over the next few days you don't need to

4075
02:22:31,978 --> 02:22:38,309
do anything to those clones around day

4076
02:22:34,889 --> 02:22:41,039
four or five those clones may need to be

4077
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:42,989
remoisten pop the dome off of the clones

4078
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:45,540
and take a look at the rapid rooters

4079
02:22:42,989 --> 02:22:47,579
don't be afraid to pick one up pull it

4080
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:49,050
right out of the tray and feel it is it

4081
02:22:47,579 --> 02:22:51,898
heavy is it moist

4082
02:22:49,049 --> 02:22:53,879
is it dry visually look at it it's

4083
02:22:51,898 --> 02:22:56,309
really easy to tell when rapid rooters

4084
02:22:53,879 --> 02:22:58,679
need moisture by looking at them when

4085
02:22:56,309 --> 02:23:00,930
they are soaked they are black they look

4086
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:02,760
completely black when they start drying

4087
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:04,829
up a little bit they get a little bit of

4088
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:07,800
a silvery gray when they are too dry

4089
02:23:04,829 --> 02:23:10,648
they become Brown try to keep them moist

4090
02:23:07,799 --> 02:23:12,478
but not soggy if you give it a little

4091
02:23:10,648 --> 02:23:14,099
gentle squeeze you don't want the water

4092
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:15,809
to run down your arms but you need a

4093
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:18,479
little moisture to stay on your fingers

4094
02:23:15,809 --> 02:23:20,250
we want them moist but not soggy we need

4095
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:22,709
that rapid Rooter to be able to hold

4096
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:24,540
enough water to sustain life but we also

4097
02:23:22,709 --> 02:23:26,579
don't want to have so much water in that

4098
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:29,340
rapid Rooter that there is no room for

4099
02:23:26,579 --> 02:23:31,439
oxygen so check your rapid Rooter for

4100
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:33,898
moisture if it is dry we need to

4101
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:36,389
remoisten it I recommend using a spray

4102
02:23:33,898 --> 02:23:38,549
bottle and spraying a very light

4103
02:23:36,389 --> 02:23:40,829
nutrient mix into the rapid rooters and

4104
02:23:38,549 --> 02:23:43,079
just spray it until they are soaked then

4105
02:23:40,829 --> 02:23:45,329
pour off the excess water if there's any

4106
02:23:43,079 --> 02:23:46,799
water left in that tray simply pour it

4107
02:23:45,329 --> 02:23:48,870
off we don't need water sitting in the

4108
02:23:46,799 --> 02:23:50,069
bottom of that tray when roots do start

4109
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:52,260
to develop if they're hanging in that

4110
02:23:50,069 --> 02:23:54,629
water they will just rot it will defeat

4111
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:56,219
the purpose so give the rapid rooters a

4112
02:23:54,629 --> 02:23:58,379
little bit of a spray get them nice and

4113
02:23:56,219 --> 02:24:00,209
moist once you've got all the plugs nice

4114
02:23:58,379 --> 02:24:02,609
and moist put the dome right back on the

4115
02:24:00,209 --> 02:24:05,609
tray and put it back under the light now

4116
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:08,220
on day 5 we're going to open the vents

4117
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:10,050
on the dome if you've got a dome with

4118
02:24:08,219 --> 02:24:11,849
the two small vents you can open them

4119
02:24:10,049 --> 02:24:13,739
all the way if you've got that dome with

4120
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:15,510
the giant vent in the middle I would say

4121
02:24:13,739 --> 02:24:17,430
maybe go a quarter maybe go half way

4122
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:19,079
don't go all the way right away that is

4123
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:21,659
too much airflow I feel like that hole

4124
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:23,489
is too big so on day five we open the

4125
02:24:21,659 --> 02:24:25,379
vents and start giving those clones a

4126
02:24:23,489 --> 02:24:27,239
little bit of airflow now we're going to

4127
02:24:25,379 --> 02:24:27,659
need to pay attention to the moisture

4128
02:24:27,239 --> 02:24:29,459
level

4129
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:31,440
a little more frequently because we are

4130
02:24:29,459 --> 02:24:33,149
allowing moisture out of that dome by

4131
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:35,159
opening those vents we are letting fresh

4132
02:24:33,149 --> 02:24:36,959
air in but we are also letting our

4133
02:24:35,159 --> 02:24:39,601
moisture out so start paying attention

4134
02:24:36,959 --> 02:24:41,549
to the clones more frequently now

4135
02:24:39,601 --> 02:24:43,800
beginning at day six we are going to

4136
02:24:41,549 --> 02:24:45,449
start hardening off the clones what that

4137
02:24:43,799 --> 02:24:47,520
means is we are simply going to start

4138
02:24:45,450 --> 02:24:49,950
removing that dome and introducing them

4139
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:51,329
to the environment slowly every day we

4140
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:53,311
don't want to just take off that dome

4141
02:24:51,329 --> 02:24:54,989
and expect the plants to live that's not

4142
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:57,060
gonna work we've got to introduce them

4143
02:24:54,989 --> 02:24:59,489
to the environment slowly right now

4144
02:24:57,060 --> 02:25:01,500
they're really relying on that dome to

4145
02:24:59,489 --> 02:25:03,299
keep the wind down and keep the humidity

4146
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:05,040
and moisture in that environment for

4147
02:25:03,299 --> 02:25:06,779
them we need to get them used to being

4148
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:09,061
in population with the rest of the big

4149
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:11,130
plants the way to do this is to take

4150
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:13,890
that dome off and slowly increase the

4151
02:25:11,129 --> 02:25:16,709
interval without the dome every day so

4152
02:25:13,890 --> 02:25:18,930
starting at day six we're going to take

4153
02:25:16,709 --> 02:25:21,089
the dome off for 15 minutes

4154
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:22,890
just take that dome off let the plants

4155
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:24,659
survive for 15 minutes check on them if

4156
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:26,789
you feel like they're too dry moisten

4157
02:25:24,659 --> 02:25:28,140
them up put the dome right back on let

4158
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:30,930
the plants hang out for the rest of the

4159
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:33,750
day the second day we're going to crack

4160
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:35,970
that dome for 15 minutes pop off the

4161
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:38,101
dome see how wet those rapid rooters are

4162
02:25:35,969 --> 02:25:39,899
if you feel like they're too dry moisten

4163
02:25:38,101 --> 02:25:41,760
them up let them sit for 15 minutes

4164
02:25:39,899 --> 02:25:43,109
check the moisture level again before

4165
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:45,300
you close them up if you feel like there

4166
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:47,190
are too dry moisten them up it's always

4167
02:25:45,299 --> 02:25:48,989
better to moisten them as you open them

4168
02:25:47,190 --> 02:25:50,970
so that you don't soak them and then put

4169
02:25:48,989 --> 02:25:53,250
the lid on I recommend you take the dome

4170
02:25:50,969 --> 02:25:55,109
off moisten them let them get their 15

4171
02:25:53,250 --> 02:25:57,149
minutes of hardening time then check

4172
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:58,590
those rapid rooters again if you feel

4173
02:25:57,149 --> 02:26:00,840
like they may need moisture go ahead and

4174
02:25:58,590 --> 02:26:02,610
add some then put that dome on there we

4175
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:05,040
are going to repeat this process again

4176
02:26:02,610 --> 02:26:07,920
on day three they get 15 minutes on day

4177
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:11,160
3 then on day 4 we are going to increase

4178
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:13,860
our interval to 20 minutes then on day 5

4179
02:26:11,159 --> 02:26:15,601
we are going to increase to 30 minutes

4180
02:26:13,860 --> 02:26:16,891
now you have to pay attention to the

4181
02:26:15,601 --> 02:26:18,329
clones as you're doing this if they

4182
02:26:16,890 --> 02:26:20,489
start looking weaker if they're getting

4183
02:26:18,329 --> 02:26:22,079
angry while the dome is off feel free to

4184
02:26:20,489 --> 02:26:24,000
put that dome back on there and rescue

4185
02:26:22,079 --> 02:26:25,319
your plants but the goal here is to

4186
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,659
harden these plants off so they can

4187
02:26:25,319 --> 02:26:28,379
learn to survive without that dome for

4188
02:26:27,659 --> 02:26:30,450
protection

4189
02:26:28,379 --> 02:26:32,219
so as these clones start getting

4190
02:26:30,450 --> 02:26:34,650
stronger we want to leave the dome off

4191
02:26:32,219 --> 02:26:36,539
longer and longer as time goes on we

4192
02:26:34,649 --> 02:26:37,659
should see little roots pop out of these

4193
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:39,490
clones around 7

4194
02:26:37,659 --> 02:26:41,260
ten days that is very strained opinion

4195
02:26:39,489 --> 02:26:44,560
but our goal is to have these little

4196
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:46,810
babies into soil around ten or 14 days

4197
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:48,549
into this process so we need to slowly

4198
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:50,199
start getting them used to the outside

4199
02:26:48,549 --> 02:26:53,379
environment by hardening them off so

4200
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:54,970
increase your open time every day but

4201
02:26:53,379 --> 02:26:57,250
also pay attention to the plants and

4202
02:26:54,969 --> 02:26:59,350
don't stress them so maybe on day six

4203
02:26:57,250 --> 02:27:01,601
you go thirty five minutes maybe on day

4204
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:02,800
seven you go 40 minutes maybe on day

4205
02:27:01,601 --> 02:27:04,569
eight you're going all the way up to

4206
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:06,549
forty five minutes maybe by day ten

4207
02:27:04,569 --> 02:27:08,860
you've got them open for a full hour our

4208
02:27:06,549 --> 02:27:10,719
goal here is that when we do transplant

4209
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:12,489
these into their 6-inch net pots or

4210
02:27:10,719 --> 02:27:14,409
their starter pots that they don't have

4211
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:16,360
to rely on that dome that they are okay

4212
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,799
being open all of the time because they

4213
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:20,260
will no longer have a dome for

4214
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:22,239
protection so slowly increase your open

4215
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:24,399
time if you can get your clone domes

4216
02:27:22,239 --> 02:27:26,379
open for two solid hours without seeing

4217
02:27:24,399 --> 02:27:29,109
any negative effects on your clones

4218
02:27:26,379 --> 02:27:31,899
they're certainly ready to go into their

4219
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:33,370
soil or Coco Pops now the most common

4220
02:27:31,899 --> 02:27:36,279
mistake I see when people are making

4221
02:27:33,370 --> 02:27:38,470
clones is they over moisten the clone

4222
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:40,540
plugs they soak them they try to drown

4223
02:27:38,469 --> 02:27:42,129
them pay close attention to the amount

4224
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:44,351
of moisture in your clone plugs you

4225
02:27:42,129 --> 02:27:46,479
don't want to drown them if you're new

4226
02:27:44,351 --> 02:27:48,460
it cutting clones I suggest you take way

4227
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:49,689
too many clones take way more than what

4228
02:27:48,459 --> 02:27:51,579
you're going to need because you're

4229
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:53,649
going to kill a bunch of them in the

4230
02:27:51,579 --> 02:27:55,899
learning process and that is acceptable

4231
02:27:53,649 --> 02:27:57,819
this is a learning process so now we

4232
02:27:55,899 --> 02:27:59,739
basically have to sustain these clones

4233
02:27:57,819 --> 02:28:02,590
in this dome until they are rooted

4234
02:27:59,739 --> 02:28:04,479
enough to put into our soil or soilless

4235
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:06,430
mix or go into our hydro setup whatever

4236
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:08,079
we choose to do with them and I told you

4237
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:10,329
that I'm going to talk about potting our

4238
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:12,370
seedlings and potting our clones in a

4239
02:28:10,329 --> 02:28:14,379
future episode so let's move on to

4240
02:28:12,370 --> 02:28:17,290
another cloning method let's talk about

4241
02:28:14,379 --> 02:28:18,879
cutting clones directly into soil if I

4242
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:21,400
were going to cut clones directly into

4243
02:28:18,879 --> 02:28:23,379
soil I would do it very similarly as the

4244
02:28:21,399 --> 02:28:25,479
method I use to cut clones into rock

4245
02:28:23,379 --> 02:28:27,670
wool cubes the main difference is that I

4246
02:28:25,479 --> 02:28:30,069
would use a beer cup filled with good

4247
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:31,569
soil I try not to recommend brands but

4248
02:28:30,069 --> 02:28:34,299
I'm going to say I would probably use

4249
02:28:31,569 --> 02:28:35,860
light Warriors soil for my babies I

4250
02:28:34,299 --> 02:28:37,750
would buy a bag of white warrior soil

4251
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:39,190
and I would buy some beer cups and I

4252
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:41,351
would poke a bunch of holes in the

4253
02:28:39,190 --> 02:28:43,540
bottom of the beer cups for drainage I

4254
02:28:41,351 --> 02:28:45,851
would pack up the beer cup with soil

4255
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:47,830
I would moisten the soil then I would

4256
02:28:45,851 --> 02:28:48,860
cut the clone exactly the same as I do

4257
02:28:47,829 --> 02:28:50,780
for the rapid route or

4258
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:52,819
I would dip it into the routing solution

4259
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:54,829
then I would make a hole in that soil

4260
02:28:52,819 --> 02:28:57,199
with my finger in this situation I would

4261
02:28:54,829 --> 02:28:59,870
go about two Knuckles deep then you

4262
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:02,210
place that dunked clone into that hole

4263
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:04,280
and gently back fill that hole just push

4264
02:29:02,209 --> 02:29:06,229
the soil right around the stem and now

4265
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:07,579
you want that plant to be supported and

4266
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,680
it looks like you've got a little baby

4267
02:29:07,579 --> 02:29:11,091
plant sticking out of a beer cup filled

4268
02:29:09,681 --> 02:29:14,210
with soil it looks like you're basically

4269
02:29:11,091 --> 02:29:16,880
done the next step is to take a clear

4270
02:29:14,209 --> 02:29:19,489
beer cup and place it upside down on top

4271
02:29:16,879 --> 02:29:21,500
of that beer cup to act as a dome then I

4272
02:29:19,489 --> 02:29:23,239
use a piece of tape generally a piece of

4273
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,011
duct tape and just wrap it right around

4274
02:29:23,239 --> 02:29:27,500
there to make sure that that lid stays

4275
02:29:25,011 --> 02:29:30,140
on there and you've created a one plant

4276
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:32,511
dome situation you've got a beer cup

4277
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:33,859
filled with soil its moistened you've

4278
02:29:32,511 --> 02:29:35,420
got a plant in there and you've put a

4279
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:37,370
dome right on top of it to keep that

4280
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:39,110
moisture in put that underneath the

4281
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:42,290
light and it will act just like the

4282
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:43,880
domed clone acts just like the rapid

4283
02:29:42,290 --> 02:29:45,801
Rooter we're gonna need to check on that

4284
02:29:43,879 --> 02:29:47,390
soil we need to keep it moist we don't

4285
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:49,310
want it soggy we don't want it soaked

4286
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:51,440
and we don't want it dry but we need it

4287
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:53,899
moist and warm so that our clone stays

4288
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:55,880
healthy and happy now the advantage here

4289
02:29:53,899 --> 02:29:57,829
is once that clone roots we don't have

4290
02:29:55,879 --> 02:30:00,560
any work to do it's already transplanted

4291
02:29:57,829 --> 02:30:02,450
into its first pot the disadvantage is

4292
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:04,761
that it takes as much space as a beer

4293
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:06,829
cup for each clone so you can't fit 50

4294
02:30:04,761 --> 02:30:09,290
clones in a small space like you could

4295
02:30:06,829 --> 02:30:10,579
in a rapid Rooter tray so the beer cups

4296
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:12,320
work if you're only trying to take a

4297
02:30:10,579 --> 02:30:13,819
couple clones and you don't want to go

4298
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:15,709
by rapid rooters and you don't want to

4299
02:30:13,819 --> 02:30:18,020
buy a dome setup you can fill up a

4300
02:30:15,709 --> 02:30:19,550
couple beer cups with dirt moisten up

4301
02:30:18,021 --> 02:30:20,061
the soil put a little hole not with your

4302
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:22,699
finger

4303
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:24,800
clip dip and stick a few clones and you

4304
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:27,440
can create clones just like you would in

4305
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:29,390
a dome setup make sure you harden off

4306
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:31,431
your cupped clones just like you do your

4307
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:34,250
domed clones and you should have healthy

4308
02:30:31,431 --> 02:30:35,630
happy little babies in beer cups all

4309
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:36,829
right you guys I've been talking for 25

4310
02:30:35,629 --> 02:30:38,449
minutes and my throat is starting to

4311
02:30:36,829 --> 02:30:40,399
make a funky noise I'm gonna press pause

4312
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:42,351
I'm gonna take a drink I'm gonna pull a

4313
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:44,511
couple of fat dabs and when I get back

4314
02:30:42,351 --> 02:30:46,610
we will continue a lesson on cloning and

4315
02:30:44,511 --> 02:30:48,950
we will talk about cutting clones in an

4316
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:51,409
easy cloner or a botanic hare turbo

4317
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:53,120
cloner machine take a couple of fat dabs

4318
02:30:51,409 --> 02:30:55,069
you guys I will be right back

4319
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:56,601
all right podcast rolled I am back and

4320
02:30:55,069 --> 02:30:58,761
it is time to talk about cutting clones

4321
02:30:56,601 --> 02:31:01,130
in a narrow cloner and that will include

4322
02:30:58,761 --> 02:31:01,521
an easy cloner or a botanic air turbo

4323
02:31:01,129 --> 02:31:03,470
clone

4324
02:31:01,521 --> 02:31:05,570
or whatever type of auto cloner you may

4325
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:07,850
have purchased or maybe even bill on

4326
02:31:05,569 --> 02:31:10,011
your own let's jump right into it my

4327
02:31:07,851 --> 02:31:12,620
first piece of advice is to replace all

4328
02:31:10,011 --> 02:31:15,530
of your clone callers each cycle and

4329
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:18,320
start with fresh clean neoprene clone

4330
02:31:15,530 --> 02:31:20,931
callers the only brand that I am aware

4331
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:23,300
of that I would approve of reusing are

4332
02:31:20,931 --> 02:31:25,131
the perma clone clone callers they are

4333
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:27,229
made from a different material that are

4334
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:28,729
much easier to sanitize and they are the

4335
02:31:27,229 --> 02:31:30,739
only brand that I would recommend

4336
02:31:28,729 --> 02:31:33,591
recycling that are the only brand I've

4337
02:31:30,739 --> 02:31:35,841
had any positive experience trying to

4338
02:31:33,591 --> 02:31:37,909
reuse if you're using the cheap neoprene

4339
02:31:35,841 --> 02:31:39,649
it's probably safest and most cost

4340
02:31:37,909 --> 02:31:41,960
effective to throw them away and buy

4341
02:31:39,649 --> 02:31:44,600
freshies every run it is most cost

4342
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:46,819
effective to buy the perma clone clone

4343
02:31:44,601 --> 02:31:49,641
callers and follow their instructions on

4344
02:31:46,819 --> 02:31:51,229
sanitizing them after each use and they

4345
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:53,600
do not pay me I've just had a lot of

4346
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:55,819
great experience with the product so

4347
02:31:53,601 --> 02:31:58,190
always start with fresh clean clone

4348
02:31:55,819 --> 02:32:00,440
callers the next step is to make sure

4349
02:31:58,190 --> 02:32:02,149
that the cloner is completely cleaned I

4350
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:03,681
like to fill the cloner up with hot

4351
02:32:02,149 --> 02:32:06,440
water and bleach and let it run for

4352
02:32:03,681 --> 02:32:08,271
about 24 hours then I dump it out hose

4353
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:09,771
it out real well fill it up with clean

4354
02:32:08,271 --> 02:32:11,211
water and let it run for just a little

4355
02:32:09,771 --> 02:32:13,159
while to make sure I rinse all that

4356
02:32:11,210 --> 02:32:15,409
bleach water out then I dump it out and

4357
02:32:13,159 --> 02:32:17,210
let it dry once it's fully dry I give it

4358
02:32:15,409 --> 02:32:19,159
a smell if I don't smell any bleach I'm

4359
02:32:17,210 --> 02:32:21,109
pretty sure that it's clean at this

4360
02:32:19,159 --> 02:32:23,329
point I fill it up with clean water

4361
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:24,771
I would suggest RO water if you've got

4362
02:32:23,329 --> 02:32:26,690
it but that is not an option for

4363
02:32:24,771 --> 02:32:28,940
everybody when I'm filling up the EZ

4364
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:31,069
cloners I generally fill them right

4365
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:32,961
below the halo the spray halo is where

4366
02:32:31,069 --> 02:32:34,789
you in where you screw the emitters that

4367
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:36,800
parts called the halo there's the pompe

4368
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:39,620
in the halo and then the emitters I fill

4369
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:41,029
it up right to the base of the halo once

4370
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:44,211
I've got the appropriate amount of water

4371
02:32:41,030 --> 02:32:46,341
in the cloner I apply clone x solution

4372
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:47,960
the purple stuff that comes in the tall

4373
02:32:46,341 --> 02:32:50,569
bottle not the thick stuff with the

4374
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:53,270
cloning solution not the clone gel it's

4375
02:32:50,569 --> 02:32:53,779
called clonic solution I apply that to

4376
02:32:53,271 --> 02:32:57,351
the cloner

4377
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:59,870
to get the EC between one point zero and

4378
02:32:57,351 --> 02:33:02,060
one point two I want my EC the

4379
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:06,200
electrical conductivity to be between

4380
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:09,229
one and one point two then I adjust the

4381
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:11,961
pH to five point seven to six point two

4382
02:33:09,229 --> 02:33:13,939
now the next step is to add clear res

4383
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:15,229
clear res is a product that will prevent

4384
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:17,021
algae from

4385
02:33:15,229 --> 02:33:20,000
building up inside of our cloner I

4386
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:23,421
recommend you put 30 milliliters of

4387
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,250
clear res for every 5 gallons of water

4388
02:33:23,421 --> 02:33:27,290
in your cloner so if you filled it up

4389
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:29,210
with a five-gallon bucket you need 30

4390
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:31,730
milliliters if you filled it up with 10

4391
02:33:29,210 --> 02:33:34,970
gallons you need 60 milliliters and so

4392
02:33:31,729 --> 02:33:36,680
forth date it get a little sticker and

4393
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:39,439
write the date on that sticker and put

4394
02:33:36,681 --> 02:33:42,351
that sticker on the cloner somewhere

4395
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:44,181
that sticker with the date is important

4396
02:33:42,351 --> 02:33:47,329
because you will need to add clear rez

4397
02:33:44,181 --> 02:33:48,950
again every 5 days that's why I put a

4398
02:33:47,329 --> 02:33:50,601
sticker on there that way if you're

4399
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:52,671
working in a facility with more than one

4400
02:33:50,601 --> 02:33:53,961
person you don't have people doubling up

4401
02:33:52,671 --> 02:33:55,700
and adding too much clear rez

4402
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:58,640
everybody's on the same page there's a

4403
02:33:55,700 --> 02:34:00,051
sticker it's as employee number 422

4404
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:01,970
clear rez on day 1

4405
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:03,560
now when day 5 comes around we know

4406
02:34:01,970 --> 02:34:06,020
somebody needs to change the clear rez

4407
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:08,181
you get 30 milliliters of clear rez per

4408
02:34:06,021 --> 02:34:10,671
five gallons and pour it right on into

4409
02:34:08,181 --> 02:34:14,870
the cloner get a sticker right employee

4410
02:34:10,671 --> 02:34:16,880
number 420 in here on this date and that

4411
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:19,370
way we know when to add more and we

4412
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:20,869
don't double up so write down how much

4413
02:34:19,370 --> 02:34:22,490
clear as you put in there and how often

4414
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:24,860
you do it so that you don't double up

4415
02:34:22,489 --> 02:34:28,341
and again I suggest you put 30

4416
02:34:24,860 --> 02:34:30,650
milliliters per every 5 gallons every 5

4417
02:34:28,341 --> 02:34:32,511
days so now we've added our clone X

4418
02:34:30,649 --> 02:34:35,390
solution we've got our EC somewhere

4419
02:34:32,511 --> 02:34:38,601
between 1 and 1.2 we've adjusted the pH

4420
02:34:35,390 --> 02:34:40,431
to somewhere between 5.7 and 6.2 we've

4421
02:34:38,601 --> 02:34:42,681
added the appropriate amount of clear

4422
02:34:40,431 --> 02:34:44,450
rez now let's put the lid on the cloner

4423
02:34:42,681 --> 02:34:46,101
let's turn on the pumps and make sure

4424
02:34:44,450 --> 02:34:47,690
all of the emitters are properly

4425
02:34:46,101 --> 02:34:49,761
functioning you're going to need to open

4426
02:34:47,690 --> 02:34:51,261
it up and peek in there and make sure

4427
02:34:49,761 --> 02:34:53,060
that all those sprayers are spraying

4428
02:34:51,261 --> 02:34:55,790
everywhere and that all the inside of

4429
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:57,591
that cloner is getting coverage pop out

4430
02:34:55,790 --> 02:34:59,120
a couple random neoprene and put your

4431
02:34:57,591 --> 02:35:00,649
finger in there and make sure that your

4432
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:02,211
finger is getting sprayed we want to

4433
02:35:00,649 --> 02:35:04,250
make sure that all of the sprayers are

4434
02:35:02,210 --> 02:35:06,470
covering all of the cloner spots inside

4435
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:07,790
of that cloner now once you're sure that

4436
02:35:06,470 --> 02:35:09,229
cloner is set up and functioning

4437
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:10,490
properly and that all of the emitters

4438
02:35:09,229 --> 02:35:13,341
are spraying and covering the entire

4439
02:35:10,489 --> 02:35:15,409
inside of that cloner it is time to take

4440
02:35:13,341 --> 02:35:17,479
our cuttings to fill the clone machine

4441
02:35:15,409 --> 02:35:20,091
we are going to take our cuttings in a

4442
02:35:17,479 --> 02:35:22,761
very similar method as we did in the

4443
02:35:20,091 --> 02:35:24,890
rapid Rooter technique we're going to

4444
02:35:22,761 --> 02:35:27,110
cut about a 5 to 8 inch cutting we're

4445
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:29,149
gonna clean it up we don't need to trim

4446
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:31,130
these leaves as extremely as we did

4447
02:35:29,149 --> 02:35:32,869
on the other setup but it is a good idea

4448
02:35:31,129 --> 02:35:35,449
to cut the tips off a little bit to

4449
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:38,510
encourage some growth so clean up your

4450
02:35:35,450 --> 02:35:41,480
cutting then cut it at a 45 degree angle

4451
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:44,450
stick it in the clone x gel I would go

4452
02:35:41,479 --> 02:35:46,789
about one inch into the clone x gel then

4453
02:35:44,450 --> 02:35:49,250
those neoprene discs open up like a

4454
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:51,680
pacman open it up to look like pac-man

4455
02:35:49,250 --> 02:35:53,899
and then close it around your clone and

4456
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,909
you want approximately one inch of

4457
02:35:53,899 --> 02:35:58,069
material sticking out of the bottom of

4458
02:35:55,909 --> 02:35:59,780
the clone then you take that neoprene

4459
02:35:58,069 --> 02:36:01,879
disc and stick it right back into the

4460
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:03,590
machine with that freshly cut part

4461
02:36:01,879 --> 02:36:05,779
sticking down into the water and the new

4462
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:07,760
plant sticking straight up now carefully

4463
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:09,530
repeat that process until you fill the

4464
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:12,079
cloner or you run out of healthy

4465
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:13,880
cuttings now I like to hang a t5 light

4466
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:16,700
above the clone machine and I generally

4467
02:36:13,879 --> 02:36:19,729
place it about eight to 12 inches above

4468
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:21,650
the canopy of the plants I also like to

4469
02:36:19,729 --> 02:36:22,430
leave the light on for 24 hours for

4470
02:36:21,649 --> 02:36:25,039
these clones

4471
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:26,930
some people may choose to go 18 on 6 off

4472
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:30,110
that is up to you I have had amazing

4473
02:36:26,930 --> 02:36:32,540
results running the lights on for 24

4474
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:34,819
hours and also leaving the pump inside

4475
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:36,710
of the cloner on for 24 hours a day you

4476
02:36:34,819 --> 02:36:39,170
can experiment with light cycles and

4477
02:36:36,709 --> 02:36:40,969
pump cycles as much as you'd like you

4478
02:36:39,170 --> 02:36:43,250
may find that 24 hours of light works

4479
02:36:40,969 --> 02:36:45,739
best for you you may find that some dark

4480
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:48,139
cycle works best for you if the water in

4481
02:36:45,739 --> 02:36:50,209
your cloner is getting too hot a good

4482
02:36:48,139 --> 02:36:52,670
way to cool that water down is by

4483
02:36:50,209 --> 02:36:54,859
letting the pump rest for a few seconds

4484
02:36:52,670 --> 02:36:57,680
every minute or a few minutes every hour

4485
02:36:54,860 --> 02:37:00,800
in one situation I would run the pump

4486
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:03,139
for 45 seconds on in 15 seconds off

4487
02:37:00,799 --> 02:37:05,359
every minute those timers are quite

4488
02:37:03,139 --> 02:37:07,609
expensive in another environment I was

4489
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:10,340
running the pump on for 45 minutes and

4490
02:37:07,610 --> 02:37:12,290
off for 15 minutes every hour and both

4491
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:15,079
of those methods worked well for me but

4492
02:37:12,290 --> 02:37:17,120
the 24 hour a day method worked just as

4493
02:37:15,079 --> 02:37:18,920
well now we've got our cloner filled up

4494
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:21,021
with fresh cuts it's gonna run overnight

4495
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:22,370
tomorrow we need to check on it

4496
02:37:21,021 --> 02:37:24,140
overnight

4497
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:25,880
that purple cloning solution which we

4498
02:37:24,139 --> 02:37:27,889
dunked in the cuttings in is going to be

4499
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:30,529
washed off of the plants and it's going

4500
02:37:27,889 --> 02:37:32,659
to end up in our reservoir in our water

4501
02:37:30,530 --> 02:37:35,239
in our cloner that's going to make the

4502
02:37:32,659 --> 02:37:37,250
pH go crazy so we need to check the pH

4503
02:37:35,239 --> 02:37:39,560
first thing in the morning and correct

4504
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:41,510
it don't be surprised if the pH has

4505
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:42,478
jumped dramatically it's because all of

4506
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:44,488
that purple stuff

4507
02:37:42,478 --> 02:37:47,099
dripped off of the plants and it is now

4508
02:37:44,488 --> 02:37:49,498
in your water so just simply adjust the

4509
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:52,890
pH up or down use a few drops of a

4510
02:37:49,498 --> 02:37:55,199
reliable pH up or down product don't use

4511
02:37:52,889 --> 02:37:57,118
some home remedy or some cheapo product

4512
02:37:55,199 --> 02:38:00,989
for your cloner in the cloner we need a

4513
02:37:57,119 --> 02:38:04,560
reliable pH up or pH down product also I

4514
02:38:00,988 --> 02:38:06,748
recommend a reliable pH pen don't buy a

4515
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:09,478
cheap pH pen you get what you pay for

4516
02:38:06,748 --> 02:38:11,908
when it comes to pH testing products

4517
02:38:09,478 --> 02:38:14,938
these cuttings are going to live in this

4518
02:38:11,908 --> 02:38:17,038
cloner for approximately 14 days we're

4519
02:38:14,939 --> 02:38:18,630
going to have to check on them every day

4520
02:38:17,039 --> 02:38:20,880
there are a few things we need to check

4521
02:38:18,629 --> 02:38:23,759
on the first thing we should check on is

4522
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:25,799
general plant health are they alive are

4523
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:28,380
they standing up are they getting yellow

4524
02:38:25,799 --> 02:38:30,509
and crinkly can you see any spider mites

4525
02:38:28,379 --> 02:38:32,488
can you see any spider mite damage can

4526
02:38:30,510 --> 02:38:34,800
you see any spider mite webbing do you

4527
02:38:32,488 --> 02:38:37,350
see any powdery mildew do the plants

4528
02:38:34,799 --> 02:38:40,019
show any sign of stress just give a nice

4529
02:38:37,350 --> 02:38:42,600
visual inspection of the plants every

4530
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:44,939
single day the next thing I suggest you

4531
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:47,908
check is the pump is the pump plugged in

4532
02:38:44,939 --> 02:38:50,158
is the pump working properly the pump is

4533
02:38:47,908 --> 02:38:52,828
basically the heart of that machine so

4534
02:38:50,158 --> 02:38:54,658
make sure it is working the next thing I

4535
02:38:52,828 --> 02:38:57,689
recommend you check is the water level

4536
02:38:54,658 --> 02:38:59,818
is the water level just below the halo

4537
02:38:57,689 --> 02:39:02,430
while you're in there why not check the

4538
02:38:59,818 --> 02:39:04,469
temperature why not check the pH and why

4539
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:07,170
not check the EC of the water in your

4540
02:39:04,469 --> 02:39:08,938
cloner you've got it open grab your pins

4541
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:11,039
grab your meters give it a little test

4542
02:39:08,939 --> 02:39:12,809
and write it down so once you've made

4543
02:39:11,039 --> 02:39:14,520
sure the pump is working you've checked

4544
02:39:12,809 --> 02:39:15,959
the water level you've checked the EC

4545
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:17,729
you check the pH and you've checked the

4546
02:39:15,959 --> 02:39:19,589
temperature I would put the lid back on

4547
02:39:17,728 --> 02:39:21,510
and then I would remove one of the

4548
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:23,340
callers and put my finger in there and

4549
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:25,318
make sure that the water is spraying

4550
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:27,180
everywhere look inside the hole while

4551
02:39:25,318 --> 02:39:28,648
that neoprene is gone and see if you can

4552
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:31,229
see that all the plants are getting

4553
02:39:28,648 --> 02:39:33,389
sprayed put that neoprene disc back and

4554
02:39:31,228 --> 02:39:35,340
if you're brave lift up the edge of the

4555
02:39:33,389 --> 02:39:37,828
cloner and look inside and make sure

4556
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:40,049
that sprayer is hitting everything try

4557
02:39:37,828 --> 02:39:42,299
to give a visual inspection to each

4558
02:39:40,049 --> 02:39:44,158
emitter inside of that machine if you're

4559
02:39:42,299 --> 02:39:46,349
using an EZ cloner you've probably got

4560
02:39:44,158 --> 02:39:47,699
the red emitters in there make sure none

4561
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:49,559
of those are clogged up if you're using

4562
02:39:47,699 --> 02:39:51,449
the botanic air turbo cloner I think

4563
02:39:49,559 --> 02:39:53,698
that comes with yellow emitters make

4564
02:39:51,449 --> 02:39:55,109
sure none of those are clogged up if you

4565
02:39:53,699 --> 02:39:56,069
do find that you've got a clogged

4566
02:39:55,109 --> 02:39:57,750
emitter you've got a

4567
02:39:56,069 --> 02:39:59,940
find something real tiny to poke down in

4568
02:39:57,750 --> 02:40:01,409
the hole and try to unclog it sometimes

4569
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:03,690
you have to take the emitter all the way

4570
02:40:01,409 --> 02:40:06,060
out of the halo to poke it and unclog it

4571
02:40:03,690 --> 02:40:08,610
be very careful those things get very

4572
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:10,949
brittle and they break very easily if

4573
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:12,780
you plan on unscrewing one I recommend

4574
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:14,490
you have a backup on hand because

4575
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:15,931
there's a good chance it's going to

4576
02:40:14,489 --> 02:40:17,129
break in fact while you're thinking

4577
02:40:15,931 --> 02:40:19,440
about it right now

4578
02:40:17,129 --> 02:40:21,300
just go to Amazon and order a bag of

4579
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:23,670
replacements because those emitters get

4580
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:25,170
broken all the time and it's going to be

4581
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:26,819
really frustrating when you're setting

4582
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:28,261
up your machine and you break two of

4583
02:40:26,819 --> 02:40:29,879
them and you can't run your cloner

4584
02:40:28,261 --> 02:40:32,280
because you've got two busted emitters

4585
02:40:29,879 --> 02:40:33,390
they're very cheap the frustrating part

4586
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:35,670
is you've got a way for them to get

4587
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:37,319
shipped to you so buy some now and then

4588
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:38,879
you've got them for when you do break

4589
02:40:37,319 --> 02:40:40,709
them because I promise you you're gonna

4590
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:42,779
break a lot of them so that's our

4591
02:40:40,709 --> 02:40:44,669
everyday inspection now remember we

4592
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:46,980
talked about the clear resin earlier

4593
02:40:44,670 --> 02:40:49,979
we've got what I like to call the fifth

4594
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:53,220
day check every five days we need to add

4595
02:40:49,979 --> 02:40:55,949
more clear res to our cloner we need to

4596
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:58,079
put thirty milliliters of clear res for

4597
02:40:55,950 --> 02:41:00,960
every five gallons of water in that

4598
02:40:58,079 --> 02:41:03,181
reservoir no earlier I suggested we

4599
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:05,760
check the EC and the pH of our res

4600
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:08,101
everyday but it is not required what is

4601
02:41:05,761 --> 02:41:11,130
required is that we check it every fifth

4602
02:41:08,101 --> 02:41:13,891
day at least make sure you check the pH

4603
02:41:11,129 --> 02:41:15,420
and the EC every five days don't let it

4604
02:41:13,890 --> 02:41:17,279
go longer than that without checking

4605
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:19,800
since you're in there adding clearer res

4606
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:22,320
anyway unplug the pump lift up the lid

4607
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:23,850
put your pH meter and your EC meter in

4608
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:25,800
there and just check it and see what it

4609
02:41:23,851 --> 02:41:27,931
says then add your clear res in there

4610
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:29,039
put the lid back on plug it in and it's

4611
02:41:27,931 --> 02:41:31,380
business as usual

4612
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:33,780
if the EC has gotten too low add a

4613
02:41:31,379 --> 02:41:35,640
little bit of the clonic solution if the

4614
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:38,370
pH is out of whack adjusted

4615
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:41,761
appropriately always adjust the pH after

4616
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:43,920
you add the clonic solution if you ever

4617
02:41:41,761 --> 02:41:46,319
find that the water level has gotten too

4618
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:48,960
low we need to add water and when we add

4619
02:41:46,319 --> 02:41:51,329
water we need to add of course clonic

4620
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:54,959
solution we need to adjust the EC

4621
02:41:51,329 --> 02:41:57,659
somewhere between 1.0 and 1.2 when we

4622
02:41:54,959 --> 02:41:59,640
add clonic solution if we add water and

4623
02:41:57,659 --> 02:42:02,399
clonic solution of course we need to

4624
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:06,750
adjust the pH again always keep the pH

4625
02:42:02,399 --> 02:42:09,060
between 5.8 and 6.0 now here's a random

4626
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:09,810
tip I keep calling the top of the cloner

4627
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:11,489
the layer

4628
02:42:09,810 --> 02:42:13,470
top I keep changing up the name for it

4629
02:42:11,489 --> 02:42:15,479
but the top of the cloner has your

4630
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:17,159
cuttings in it so when we're taking off

4631
02:42:15,479 --> 02:42:19,619
that top to work on the water

4632
02:42:17,159 --> 02:42:21,659
be very careful keep in mind that the

4633
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:23,341
bottoms of your clothes are sticking out

4634
02:42:21,659 --> 02:42:26,159
of the bottom of that cloner they are in

4635
02:42:23,341 --> 02:42:27,931
there exposed if you are going to slide

4636
02:42:26,159 --> 02:42:29,909
that cloner across the top of the clone

4637
02:42:27,931 --> 02:42:31,860
machine diagonally to make it rest

4638
02:42:29,909 --> 02:42:33,751
across the cloner don't let it fall

4639
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:35,909
toward the bottoms of those cuttings hit

4640
02:42:33,751 --> 02:42:38,341
the edge of the cloner and get broken it

4641
02:42:35,909 --> 02:42:40,530
may be safest to lift the top off and

4642
02:42:38,341 --> 02:42:42,329
just set it down on the table it's going

4643
02:42:40,530 --> 02:42:44,521
to drip water it's gonna drip stuff onto

4644
02:42:42,329 --> 02:42:46,229
the table or wherever you set it but you

4645
02:42:44,521 --> 02:42:47,820
won't crush the bottoms of the cuttings

4646
02:42:46,229 --> 02:42:49,680
because the cloner is tall enough to

4647
02:42:47,819 --> 02:42:51,931
protect them if you turn a diagonal

4648
02:42:49,681 --> 02:42:53,851
across the base of the clone machine

4649
02:42:51,931 --> 02:42:56,011
across the reservoir portion of the

4650
02:42:53,851 --> 02:42:57,751
cloner you do run the risk of tipping it

4651
02:42:56,011 --> 02:43:00,001
over I've seen it happen quite often you

4652
02:42:57,751 --> 02:43:01,171
get that angle going one guy moves the

4653
02:43:00,001 --> 02:43:03,091
other guy moves you push it one

4654
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:04,800
direction it'll fall off a corner and

4655
02:43:03,091 --> 02:43:06,961
you will break a lot of cuttings

4656
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:08,760
be careful keep in mind that those

4657
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:10,140
cuttings are exposed they're sticking

4658
02:43:08,761 --> 02:43:12,421
out of the bottom there when you're

4659
02:43:10,140 --> 02:43:15,239
doing work on the cloner itself don't

4660
02:43:12,421 --> 02:43:17,041
forget about the clones and also if you

4661
02:43:15,239 --> 02:43:18,659
lift it up like it's a hatchback if you

4662
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,369
just lift it up to look inside there

4663
02:43:18,659 --> 02:43:22,261
keep in mind you're probably pushing

4664
02:43:20,370 --> 02:43:24,181
some of those clones directly into the

4665
02:43:22,261 --> 02:43:25,950
light you've got that t5 light hanging

4666
02:43:24,181 --> 02:43:27,631
right above your cloner and as you lift

4667
02:43:25,950 --> 02:43:29,159
it those clones on the edge closest

4668
02:43:27,630 --> 02:43:30,359
towards you they're moving right up and

4669
02:43:29,159 --> 02:43:32,700
they're getting pushed into the light

4670
02:43:30,360 --> 02:43:34,681
above you so pay attention to the root

4671
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:36,181
base part of your cuttings and pay

4672
02:43:34,681 --> 02:43:37,620
attention to the parts sticking out of

4673
02:43:36,181 --> 02:43:39,659
the top of the cloner when you're

4674
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:42,150
working on the inside of your cone

4675
02:43:39,659 --> 02:43:43,681
machine now these cuttings which are

4676
02:43:42,149 --> 02:43:46,319
going to turn into clones will live

4677
02:43:43,681 --> 02:43:50,101
inside of our clone machine for about 14

4678
02:43:46,319 --> 02:43:52,079
days in about four to seven days you'll

4679
02:43:50,101 --> 02:43:54,060
see a little wart look and things pop up

4680
02:43:52,079 --> 02:43:56,011
on that stem that is inside the clone

4681
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:58,380
machine that is where the roots are

4682
02:43:56,011 --> 02:44:00,360
going to start popping out of by day ten

4683
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:00,689
you should have nice roots coming out of

4684
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:03,900
there

4685
02:44:00,690 --> 02:44:05,761
then by d14 you should have a start of a

4686
02:44:03,899 --> 02:44:07,229
little spaghetti factory just coming out

4687
02:44:05,761 --> 02:44:08,700
of the bottom of those plants it should

4688
02:44:07,229 --> 02:44:10,859
look like a little set of dreadlocks

4689
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:12,631
hanging off of each of those plants that

4690
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:15,211
is when it is time to take our new

4691
02:44:12,630 --> 02:44:17,850
clones and put them into their soil into

4692
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:19,439
their Coco or into their hydro setup so

4693
02:44:17,851 --> 02:44:21,211
that feels like a perfect spot to start

4694
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,189
wrapping up this lesson I've already

4695
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:24,898
promised that in a very soon to come

4696
02:44:23,189 --> 02:44:28,109
episode I would talk about putting our

4697
02:44:24,898 --> 02:44:30,238
seedlings and clones into cocoa or soil

4698
02:44:28,109 --> 02:44:32,430
so the only part left to talk about now

4699
02:44:30,238 --> 02:44:34,680
is cleaning our cloner once you are done

4700
02:44:32,430 --> 02:44:37,289
with the cloner we need to clean it I

4701
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:39,658
start by draining all of the water then

4702
02:44:37,289 --> 02:44:42,959
I fill it up again with fresh water I

4703
02:44:39,658 --> 02:44:45,118
also add 2 or 3 cups of bleach depending

4704
02:44:42,959 --> 02:44:47,819
on the size of the cloner then I plug it

4705
02:44:45,119 --> 02:44:50,789
in and I let it run overnight the next

4706
02:44:47,818 --> 02:44:53,728
day I drain all of that water if I'm not

4707
02:44:50,789 --> 02:44:55,709
using permaculture oh the callers away

4708
02:44:53,728 --> 02:44:57,629
and by freshies if I've got perma clones

4709
02:44:55,709 --> 02:45:01,170
I followed their instructions on how to

4710
02:44:57,629 --> 02:45:03,358
sanitize and reuse them then I take the

4711
02:45:01,170 --> 02:45:05,010
cloner outside and I spray it down

4712
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:07,498
really well with the hose to get rid of

4713
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:09,510
that bleach I take it apart completely I

4714
02:45:07,498 --> 02:45:11,998
take the pump apart and I clean the pump

4715
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:13,228
completely it is really easy to clean if

4716
02:45:11,998 --> 02:45:15,208
you take it apart get a little

4717
02:45:13,228 --> 02:45:17,238
toothbrush or a little brush and just

4718
02:45:15,209 --> 02:45:20,220
scrub it it does not take that long

4719
02:45:17,238 --> 02:45:21,779
clean it then I use a paper clip or

4720
02:45:20,219 --> 02:45:23,788
something similar to clean out all of

4721
02:45:21,779 --> 02:45:25,619
the emitters you guys like I said

4722
02:45:23,789 --> 02:45:26,909
earlier have extra emitters on hand

4723
02:45:25,619 --> 02:45:29,069
because when you start taking them out

4724
02:45:26,908 --> 02:45:31,078
they are going to break they get brittle

4725
02:45:29,068 --> 02:45:33,719
and they get especially more brittle

4726
02:45:31,078 --> 02:45:36,029
after you run bleach through the machine

4727
02:45:33,719 --> 02:45:38,429
so clean everything up then put it all

4728
02:45:36,029 --> 02:45:40,560
back together then it is ready for use

4729
02:45:38,430 --> 02:45:42,689
the next time you need clones in a

4730
02:45:40,559 --> 02:45:44,908
commercial environment are easy cloners

4731
02:45:42,689 --> 02:45:46,590
our turbo cloners never got a break by

4732
02:45:44,908 --> 02:45:48,208
the time the guys could empty him I had

4733
02:45:46,590 --> 02:45:49,498
two more guys carrying them outside they

4734
02:45:48,209 --> 02:45:50,279
were hosing them down by the time they

4735
02:45:49,498 --> 02:45:52,559
got brought in

4736
02:45:50,279 --> 02:45:54,479
I had cuttings cut and ready to go into

4737
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:57,028
those corners they never get a break in

4738
02:45:54,478 --> 02:45:58,769
a commercial environment all right you

4739
02:45:57,029 --> 02:46:00,748
guys that is my lesson on cutting clones

4740

4793
02:47:57,809 --> 02:48:01,288
cotton candy when I dab it it goes

4794
02:48:00,119 --> 02:48:03,119
straight to my head it makes my brain

4795
02:48:01,289 --> 02:48:05,100
goes super fast it makes my mouth go

4796
02:48:03,119 --> 02:48:07,379
super fast so I think this will be a

4797
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:09,720
great concentrate for smoking before a

4805
02:48:21,719 --> 02:48:25,828
Martin uuk thanks for supporting the

4806
02:48:23,789 --> 02:48:27,869
podcast I really do appreciate all of

4807
02:48:25,828 --> 02:48:29,398
the support ladies and gentlemen this is

4808
02:48:27,869 --> 02:48:31,409
going to be another grow lesson I have

4809
02:48:29,398 --> 02:48:33,389
been doing a long series of grow lessons

4810
02:48:31,408 --> 02:48:35,248
I hope you have been following along if

4811
02:48:33,389 --> 02:48:37,738
you are interested I recommend you go

4812
02:48:35,248 --> 02:48:39,779
back to episode 351 that's where I start

4813
02:48:37,738 --> 02:48:41,398
this long series of grow lessons start

4814
02:48:39,779 --> 02:48:41,998
there and get caught up if you feel like

4815
02:48:41,398 --> 02:48:44,189
you're up to speed

4816
02:48:41,998 --> 02:48:46,350
welcome to the grow lessons in the last

4817
02:48:44,189 --> 02:48:48,088
two episodes we talked about sprouting

4818
02:48:46,350 --> 02:48:49,189
seeds we also talked about cutting

4819
02:48:48,088 --> 02:48:50,869
clones

4820
02:48:49,189 --> 02:48:52,850
this episode we're going to talk about

4821
02:48:50,869 --> 02:48:56,300
putting those seeds and those clones

4822
02:48:52,850 --> 02:48:58,609
into containers of soil or soilless mix

4823
02:48:56,299 --> 02:49:00,498
so let's start with the seeds we talked

4824
02:48:58,609 --> 02:49:01,699
about germinating in paper towels I may

4825
02:49:00,498 --> 02:49:03,590
have covered this briefly in the

4826
02:49:01,699 --> 02:49:05,300
previous episode but we're going to talk

4827
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:06,920
about it a little bit of a recap right

4828
02:49:05,299 --> 02:49:09,590
here just to make sure everybody is up

4829
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:11,420
to speed so we started a few seeds will

4830
02:49:09,590 --> 02:49:13,520
be folded a paper towel we soaked it we

4831
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:14,799
put seeds on the paper towel we folded

4832
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:17,359
it again to secure the seeds inside

4833
02:49:14,799 --> 02:49:19,188
maybe we put that in a baggie maybe we

4834
02:49:17,359 --> 02:49:21,199
put that in a warm place the seeds it

4835
02:49:19,189 --> 02:49:23,148
now sprouted hopefully they've got

4836
02:49:21,199 --> 02:49:25,010
little tiny tails maybe a quarter of an

4837
02:49:23,148 --> 02:49:26,958
inch maybe a half inch hopefully you

4838
02:49:25,010 --> 02:49:29,600
didn't go any more than one inch long

4839
02:49:26,959 --> 02:49:32,239
here is how I recommend planting those

4840
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:33,920
seedlings I generally try to stay away

4841
02:49:32,238 --> 02:49:35,420
from recommending products every time I

4842
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:37,549
recommend a product I get emails from

4843
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:39,439
people saying I did something wrong but

4844
02:49:37,549 --> 02:49:42,228
I want to make this easy for everybody

4845
02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:44,600
so I recommend light warrior soil from

4846
02:49:42,228 --> 02:49:46,698
Fox farms for your new seedlings it is

4847
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:49,158
readily available it is affordable and

4848
02:49:46,699 --> 02:49:50,600
it works very well I'm sure other people

4849
02:49:49,158 --> 02:49:52,969
will have other ideas and other

4850
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:53,779
suggestions I am okay with that do what

4851
02:49:52,969 --> 02:49:56,118
you're comfortable with

4852
02:49:53,779 --> 02:49:58,279
I recommend this product because like I

4853
02:49:56,119 --> 02:49:59,869
said it's available it's affordable and

4854
02:49:58,279 --> 02:50:01,640
I know that it works I'm not gonna send

4855
02:49:59,869 --> 02:50:03,170
people on some crazy mission looking for

4856
02:50:01,639 --> 02:50:05,358
a product that's hard to find or

4857
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:07,189
overpriced so we've got our medium you

4858
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:08,720
can probably get away with one bag of

4859
02:50:07,189 --> 02:50:10,789
white warrior soil now we need

4860
02:50:08,719 --> 02:50:13,670
containers to put this soil in to put

4861
02:50:10,789 --> 02:50:16,010
our seedlings in I recommend small pots

4862
02:50:13,670 --> 02:50:18,318
for small plants there's no reason to

4863
02:50:16,010 --> 02:50:20,119
fill up a big three gallon pot and then

4864
02:50:18,318 --> 02:50:21,648
plant a little tiny seedling in there

4865
02:50:20,119 --> 02:50:24,050
and then you have to water that entire

4866
02:50:21,648 --> 02:50:26,478
space of soil you have to put water and

4867
02:50:24,049 --> 02:50:28,670
nutrients in all of that space just to

4868
02:50:26,478 --> 02:50:30,228
water that plant properly if you've got

4869
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:32,180
your seedling inside of a little tiny

4870
02:50:30,228 --> 02:50:33,738
cup you only have to water that much

4871
02:50:32,180 --> 02:50:35,029
space you don't have to waste water you

4872
02:50:33,738 --> 02:50:37,549
don't have to waste nutrients and you

4873
02:50:35,029 --> 02:50:39,979
don't have to waste space a lot of new

4874
02:50:37,549 --> 02:50:41,929
growers really like to drown seedlings

4875
02:50:39,978 --> 02:50:43,398
in larger pots if they put a sealing in

4876
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:45,229
a larger pot they've got to water all of

4877
02:50:43,398 --> 02:50:46,908
that soil so they go and they pour an

4878
02:50:45,228 --> 02:50:48,920
entire pitcher of water right on top of

4879
02:50:46,908 --> 02:50:50,840
that three gallon pot then that seedling

4880
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:52,219
gets washed away in all that water who

4881
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:53,719
knows where it goes sometimes when

4882
02:50:52,219 --> 02:50:55,578
people apply water they do it kind of

4883
02:50:53,719 --> 02:50:57,318
heavily the seed gets washed away it

4884
02:50:55,578 --> 02:50:59,299
gets lost in there they kill the seeds

4885
02:50:57,318 --> 02:51:00,828
they drown they fail with the seeds they

4886
02:50:59,299 --> 02:51:02,069
get discouraged so I highly recommend

4887
02:51:00,828 --> 02:51:04,590
starting with a

4888
02:51:02,069 --> 02:51:07,020
our pot maybe a 4-inch net pot maybe a

4889
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:08,819
6-inch net pot maybe a four inch square

4890
02:51:07,021 --> 02:51:10,561
pot maybe a six inch circular pot

4891
02:51:08,819 --> 02:51:13,050
something that size

4892
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:14,970
I honestly start my seedlings in a beer

4893
02:51:13,050 --> 02:51:16,829
cup I take a few beer cups I stack them

4894
02:51:14,970 --> 02:51:18,659
up on top of each other then I put a

4895
02:51:16,829 --> 02:51:21,000
drill through the bottom of them I can

4896
02:51:18,659 --> 02:51:22,739
go through about 8 cups at a time I poke

4897
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,360
one big hole through the bottom and I'll

4898
02:51:22,739 --> 02:51:26,310
do a few smaller holes on the side just

4899
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:28,290
to give some proper drainage and I feel

4900
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:30,239
like beer cups are the perfect size for

4901
02:51:28,290 --> 02:51:31,950
new baby seedlings the seedlings can

4902
02:51:30,239 --> 02:51:33,420
sprout in there they can get a good

4903
02:51:31,950 --> 02:51:35,130
start they can develop a good root

4904
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:36,569
system and by the time they get big

4905
02:51:35,129 --> 02:51:38,909
enough you can just up pop them into

4906
02:51:36,569 --> 02:51:41,011
there 3 or 5 gallon pot and it works

4907
02:51:38,909 --> 02:51:43,110
really well so let's talk about actually

4908
02:51:41,011 --> 02:51:44,521
putting these seedlings into I'm gonna

4909
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:46,560
go with the beer cup for this method

4910
02:51:44,521 --> 02:51:49,500
I've got my beer cup I've got my light

4911
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:51,511
warrior soil mix I'm gonna fill my beer

4912
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:53,399
cup most of the way up with soil I want

4913
02:51:51,511 --> 02:51:54,690
to pack it down fairly tight then I'm

4914
02:51:53,399 --> 02:51:56,279
gonna fill it up with soil and leave

4915
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:57,810
myself about a quarter of an inch so

4916
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:59,340
that when I water I've got plenty of

4917
02:51:57,810 --> 02:52:01,440
room for water and it doesn't just run

4918
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:03,360
off the top of the cup so I fill it up

4919
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:06,750
I've got about quarter inch of space

4920
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:08,880
left on the top then I water that soil

4921
02:52:06,750 --> 02:52:10,829
before I even put my clone or my

4922
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:12,449
seedling into it in this case we're

4923
02:52:10,829 --> 02:52:13,771
gonna put a sealing in there so I would

4924
02:52:12,450 --> 02:52:15,750
water it since I'm going with the

4925
02:52:13,771 --> 02:52:18,480
sealing I do not use any nutrients at

4926
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:20,399
this time I'll water it I'll let all

4927
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:22,529
that water soak through the bottom then

4928
02:52:20,399 --> 02:52:24,209
I take my pointer finger and I dig a

4929
02:52:22,530 --> 02:52:25,860
little hole just right to the first

4930
02:52:24,209 --> 02:52:27,689
knuckle on my finger then I put that

4931
02:52:25,860 --> 02:52:29,761
little freshly sprouted seedling right

4932
02:52:27,690 --> 02:52:31,890
inside that hole if the ceiling has

4933
02:52:29,761 --> 02:52:33,601
developed a long tail that taproot if

4934
02:52:31,890 --> 02:52:35,761
that tap root has gotten long you need

4935
02:52:33,601 --> 02:52:38,130
to make that be facing down and the seed

4936
02:52:35,761 --> 02:52:40,409
facing up you want the seed coming up in

4937
02:52:38,129 --> 02:52:43,050
the tap root going down so gently place

4938
02:52:40,409 --> 02:52:44,670
that seed facing down or the tap root

4939
02:52:43,050 --> 02:52:45,959
facing down the seed pointing up place

4940
02:52:44,670 --> 02:52:47,489
that right in the dirt dig the hole as

4941
02:52:45,959 --> 02:52:49,140
you need as deep as you need to dig it

4942
02:52:47,489 --> 02:52:50,459
if you've got a longer tap root just

4943
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:52,800
push your finger in there as long as you

4944
02:52:50,459 --> 02:52:54,449
need to go then gently set that tap root

4945
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:55,920
down in there and then you just want to

4946
02:52:54,450 --> 02:52:57,150
put the dirt right over a real gently

4947
02:52:55,920 --> 02:52:58,470
you don't need to pack it down

4948
02:52:57,149 --> 02:52:59,819
just make sure that it's covered up to

4949
02:52:58,470 --> 02:53:01,140
where the lights not getting to it and

4950
02:52:59,819 --> 02:53:02,789
it is packed in there tight enough when

4951
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:04,379
you water it the next time that water

4952
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:05,820
will probably pack it just tight enough

4953
02:53:04,379 --> 02:53:07,589
for you you don't need to press it down

4954
02:53:05,819 --> 02:53:09,720
too much at this point you don't want to

4955
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:11,550
risk crushing that seedling so if you've

4956
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:13,140
got a real short tail just go knuckle

4957
02:53:11,550 --> 02:53:14,520
deep drop that little sealing right in

4958
02:53:13,140 --> 02:53:14,879
there and bury it if you've got kind of

4959
02:53:14,521 --> 02:53:16,590
a law

4960
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:18,509
Tail you've got to dig a little deeper

4961
02:53:16,590 --> 02:53:20,340
of a whole set that tail down in there

4962
02:53:18,510 --> 02:53:22,770
and then just carefully bury that be

4963
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:25,380
really careful not to disturb that white

4964
02:53:22,770 --> 02:53:27,930
taproot that is really delicate and it's

4965
02:53:25,379 --> 02:53:29,759
important that it is not disrupted now

4966
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:32,069
your new seedlings are basically potted

4967
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:34,260
in their cups of dirt I would place them

4968
02:53:32,069 --> 02:53:36,420
under a t5 light with the t5 light about

4969
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:38,969
eight to twelve inches away I would try

4970
02:53:36,420 --> 02:53:40,350
to keep them around 75 to 85 degrees and

4971
02:53:38,969 --> 02:53:42,389
I would try to keep it quite humid

4972
02:53:40,350 --> 02:53:43,860
around these little tiny baby plants now

4973
02:53:42,389 --> 02:53:45,779
when it comes time to water these new

4974
02:53:43,860 --> 02:53:48,479
seedlings we have to be very careful for

4975
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:51,420
the first few days I recommend using a

4976
02:53:48,478 --> 02:53:53,398
sprayer to water new seedlings I got a

4977
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:55,469
tiny 1 gallon pump sprayer from the

4978
02:53:53,398 --> 02:53:57,329
local hardware store I mix it with my

4979
02:53:55,469 --> 02:53:59,340
whatever nutrient solution I'm gonna use

4980
02:53:57,329 --> 02:54:01,530
or just plain water that's been pH

4981
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:04,110
balanced correctly then I pump it real

4982
02:54:01,530 --> 02:54:05,850
hard and I just spray the topsoil with

4983
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:07,649
that water instead of pouring a heavy

4984
02:54:05,850 --> 02:54:09,960
dose of water in and risking drowning

4985
02:54:07,648 --> 02:54:11,699
those seeds or disrupting those seeds I

4986
02:54:09,959 --> 02:54:13,228
just spray it from the top I kind of

4987
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:15,420
spray it at a few angles that way get

4988
02:54:13,228 --> 02:54:17,129
all the soil saturated and it works just

4989
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:18,960
like the morning dew would so I feel

4990
02:54:17,129 --> 02:54:20,969
like spraying them is really gentle and

4991
02:54:18,959 --> 02:54:22,859
it works really well for new growers to

4992
02:54:20,969 --> 02:54:24,478
not drown these plants and not flood the

4993
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:26,819
soil when they're starting baby

4994
02:54:24,478 --> 02:54:29,099
seedlings now let's briefly talk about

4995
02:54:26,819 --> 02:54:31,139
when to start feeding our seedlings I

4996
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:33,930
like to start feeding when I see the

4997
02:54:31,139 --> 02:54:36,389
first set of truly developed leaves when

4998
02:54:33,930 --> 02:54:37,710
you see the first set of 5 or 7 or 9

4999
02:54:36,389 --> 02:54:39,449
depending on what variety you're growing

5000
02:54:37,709 --> 02:54:41,159
when you see the first set of full

5001
02:54:39,450 --> 02:54:43,560
leaves that's what I like to start

5002
02:54:41,159 --> 02:54:45,659
adding nutrients depending on your brand

5003
02:54:43,559 --> 02:54:47,579
and your product I usually recommend you

5004
02:54:45,659 --> 02:54:49,978
start with about 1/4 strength if the

5005
02:54:47,579 --> 02:54:51,420
bottle says to use 40 milliliters of a

5006
02:54:49,978 --> 02:54:52,949
certain product I would recommend you

5007
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:54,689
start with 10 milliliters of that

5008
02:54:52,950 --> 02:54:56,490
product and then as that plant gets

5009
02:54:54,689 --> 02:54:58,739
bigger and stronger and more developed

5010
02:54:56,489 --> 02:55:00,239
then you can increase your nutrient

5011
02:54:58,739 --> 02:55:02,010
feedings to those plants but while

5012
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:03,569
they're small let's feed them lightly so

5013
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:05,550
we don't roast them now let's talk

5014
02:55:03,569 --> 02:55:07,260
briefly about what to feed them these

5015
02:55:05,549 --> 02:55:09,449
plants need a little bit of nitrogen

5016
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:11,370
they need a very small amount of

5017
02:55:09,450 --> 02:55:13,260
phosphorous and a very small amount of

5018
02:55:11,370 --> 02:55:15,780
potassium oast of your basic grow

5019
02:55:13,260 --> 02:55:17,939
nutrients will be just fine for small

5020
02:55:15,780 --> 02:55:20,850
seedlings I would recommend adding a

5021
02:55:17,939 --> 02:55:23,370
root inoculant product something like

5022
02:55:20,850 --> 02:55:25,319
mammoth pea something like great white

5023
02:55:23,370 --> 02:55:27,570
something like recharge something like

5024
02:55:25,319 --> 02:55:28,380
plus life any of those products will

5025
02:55:27,569 --> 02:55:30,119
work for you

5026
02:55:28,380 --> 02:55:31,890
do a little bit of research find what's

5027
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:33,721
available in your area find what fits

5028
02:55:31,890 --> 02:55:36,210
your price range and get the product

5029
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:37,109
that will work best for you something is

5030
02:55:36,210 --> 02:55:39,029
better than nothing

5031
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:40,831
when it comes to root inoculants and

5032
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:42,721
microbes and beneficial fungus and

5033
02:55:40,831 --> 02:55:44,220
bacteria I highly recommend it for small

5034
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:47,369
plants and I highly recommend it

5035
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:48,569
throughout the entire growing process so

5036
02:55:47,370 --> 02:55:50,251
when your plants are little they're not

5037
02:55:48,569 --> 02:55:51,810
going to need a whole lot of nutrients

5038
02:55:50,251 --> 02:55:53,909
just a base nutrient and I highly

5039
02:55:51,810 --> 02:55:56,040
recommend some sort of root inoculant

5040
02:55:53,909 --> 02:55:57,960
they won't need cal-mag probably until

5041
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:59,670
we transplant them into the next pot if

5042
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:01,470
you want to add a full Vic or a humic

5043
02:55:59,671 --> 02:56:03,690
acid that's always good for the plants

5044
02:56:01,470 --> 02:56:05,640
at all stages but at this point I mainly

5045
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:07,771
like to focus on healthy plants with

5046
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:09,479
strong roots so I really focus on root

5047
02:56:07,771 --> 02:56:11,730
development at this stage of the game

5048
02:56:09,479 --> 02:56:14,011
I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus

5049
02:56:11,729 --> 02:56:15,569
and then I'll also add carbohydrates but

5050
02:56:14,011 --> 02:56:17,791
at this point like I said I am mainly

5051
02:56:15,569 --> 02:56:19,710
focusing on root development until I

5052
02:56:17,790 --> 02:56:21,540
transplant those plants into their next

5053
02:56:19,710 --> 02:56:23,069
pots so we talked a little bit about

5054
02:56:21,540 --> 02:56:26,040
what to feed these little babies let's

5055
02:56:23,069 --> 02:56:28,560
talk about pH for small seedlings I like

5056
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:30,930
to keep my pH around five point eight to

5057
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:33,300
six point two once they get a little bit

5058
02:56:30,931 --> 02:56:34,950
larger I will increase the pH slowly and

5059
02:56:33,300 --> 02:56:36,989
I'll move up towards six point three or

5060
02:56:34,950 --> 02:56:39,211
six point four but for these small

5061
02:56:36,989 --> 02:56:41,880
babies let's stay closer to five point

5062
02:56:39,210 --> 02:56:43,739
eight or six point two now really take

5063
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:45,689
your time increasing the amount of

5064
02:56:43,739 --> 02:56:47,581
nutrients you give these plants and also

5065
02:56:45,690 --> 02:56:49,890
take your time increasing the pH of

5066
02:56:47,581 --> 02:56:51,511
these plants they need to grow they need

5067
02:56:49,890 --> 02:56:53,431
to get a root system to be able to

5068
02:56:51,511 --> 02:56:55,739
process all of this stuff you're giving

5069
02:56:53,431 --> 02:56:57,601
them these little tiny plants don't want

5070
02:56:55,739 --> 02:56:59,909
a lot and you do run the risk of burning

5071
02:56:57,601 --> 02:57:02,730
them if you overfeed them so pay

5072
02:56:59,909 --> 02:57:05,011
attention and go slow now after several

5073
02:57:02,729 --> 02:57:06,449
days these seedlings will start taking

5074
02:57:05,011 --> 02:57:08,251
off they'll start getting full sized

5075
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:10,320
leaves and they will start catching up

5076
02:57:08,251 --> 02:57:13,110
to the same size as the clones we cut

5077
02:57:10,319 --> 02:57:15,931
once they reach that size I consider

5078
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:18,091
them to be small veg plants and I treat

5079
02:57:15,931 --> 02:57:19,980
them just like I do my small veg plants

5080
02:57:18,091 --> 02:57:22,501
and we will talk about caring for and

5081
02:57:19,979 --> 02:57:24,659
feeding small veg plants here in the

5082
02:57:22,501 --> 02:57:27,120
near future next let's talk about

5083
02:57:24,659 --> 02:57:28,979
planting our rapid rooters maybe we

5084
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:30,990
planted some seedlings in Rapid Reuters

5085
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:32,790
maybe we cut some clones and rapid

5086
02:57:30,989 --> 02:57:34,501
rooters and put them in a dome and now

5087
02:57:32,790 --> 02:57:37,319
they are sprouting roots and it is time

5088
02:57:34,501 --> 02:57:39,569
to plant them how do we know when it is

5089
02:57:37,319 --> 02:57:40,399
time to plant our rapid rooters ceilings

5090
02:57:39,569 --> 02:57:42,649
or a clone

5091
02:57:40,399 --> 02:57:44,449
I like to plant seedlings as soon as I

5092
02:57:42,649 --> 02:57:46,190
see that first tap root coming out of

5093
02:57:44,450 --> 02:57:48,230
the rapid Rooter I don't want to let

5094
02:57:46,190 --> 02:57:50,271
that tap root get too long too leggy and

5095
02:57:48,229 --> 02:57:52,850
too stretchy so I do my best to get

5096
02:57:50,271 --> 02:57:54,680
those into soil right away when I cut

5097
02:57:52,851 --> 02:57:56,930
clones and rapid rooters I like to make

5098
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:59,389
sure they are sufficiently rooted before

5099
02:57:56,930 --> 02:58:01,280
I try to put them into soil make sure

5100
02:57:59,389 --> 02:58:02,750
your clones are properly hardened off we

5101
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:05,360
talked about this in a previous episode

5102
02:58:02,750 --> 02:58:07,129
we have to expose our domed clones to

5103
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:09,409
fresh air for durations of time and

5104
02:58:07,129 --> 02:58:10,939
extend that duration over a period of

5105
02:58:09,409 --> 02:58:12,771
time to make sure the clones are ready

5106
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:14,690
to not be in a humidity controlled

5107
02:58:12,771 --> 02:58:17,300
environment we need to get them used to

5108
02:58:14,690 --> 02:58:18,829
being in our regular veg environment so

5109
02:58:17,299 --> 02:58:20,359
we've been hardening off our clones and

5110
02:58:18,829 --> 02:58:22,521
they show sufficient roots what do I

5111
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:25,521
mean by sufficient roots I want at least

5112
02:58:22,521 --> 02:58:27,320
five maybe ten or twelve white thick

5113
02:58:25,521 --> 02:58:28,970
roots popping out of that rapid Rooter I

5114
02:58:27,319 --> 02:58:30,529
want them to be just busting out of

5115
02:58:28,969 --> 02:58:31,969
there and kind of thick I want them to

5116
02:58:30,530 --> 02:58:33,620
look like they're just little worms

5117
02:58:31,969 --> 02:58:36,139
coming out looking for somewhere to go

5118
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:37,790
if you've got more than five maybe more

5119
02:58:36,139 --> 02:58:40,129
than 12 and they start building up in

5120
02:58:37,790 --> 02:58:41,900
there you were really doing well we want

5121
02:58:40,129 --> 02:58:44,270
to develop a nice root system before we

5122
02:58:41,899 --> 02:58:46,699
pot it but there is a fine line between

5123
02:58:44,271 --> 02:58:48,470
just enough and too much if you lift

5124
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:50,240
that little clone up out of that tray

5125
02:58:48,469 --> 02:58:52,250
and the roots have begun wrapping around

5126
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:54,560
the Rooter you've gone too far

5127
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:56,060
if those roots are hanging down inside

5128
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:58,159
the root or tray and hanging into the

5129
02:58:56,060 --> 02:58:59,899
water we have gone too far we want to

5130
02:58:58,159 --> 02:59:02,389
get those into our soilless mix as soon

5131
02:58:59,899 --> 02:59:04,129
as possible I want just a little bit of

5132
02:59:02,389 --> 02:59:05,930
dreadlocks just hanging out of there not

5133
02:59:04,129 --> 02:59:08,329
a lot just maybe a little tiny mop just

5134
02:59:05,930 --> 02:59:10,069
a little fuzzball maybe 10 or 20 of them

5135
02:59:08,329 --> 02:59:12,319
just hanging out that is prime time to

5136
02:59:10,069 --> 02:59:14,000
pot those and I want them about a half

5137
02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:16,459
inch to an inch and a half long is

5138
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:18,530
perfect now let's put these rapid

5139
02:59:16,459 --> 02:59:21,139
rooters into our beer cup full of light

5140
02:59:18,530 --> 02:59:22,610
warrior soil or whatever size pot and

5141
02:59:21,139 --> 02:59:24,260
whatever soil makes you choose to use

5142
02:59:22,610 --> 02:59:26,360
just make sure it's a quality soil mix

5143
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:27,829
with plenty of aeration and make sure

5144
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:29,989
whatever size or whatever container you

5145
02:59:27,829 --> 02:59:31,549
use has plenty of drainage we don't want

5146
02:59:29,989 --> 02:59:33,500
our plants to get muddy at the bottom

5147
02:59:31,549 --> 02:59:35,359
get stagnant water that will totally

5148
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:37,010
drown and destroy our roots will get

5149
02:59:35,360 --> 02:59:39,890
root rot it will be a mess it will be

5150
02:59:37,010 --> 02:59:42,200
disgusting so quality soil pots with

5151
02:59:39,889 --> 02:59:44,449
good drainage that is a requirement now

5152
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:46,340
just like we did the beer cups for our

5153
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:48,470
small seedlings let's fill them up with

5154
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:51,260
soil and leave ourselves about a quarter

5155
02:59:48,469 --> 02:59:52,789
of an inch of space for water now if I'm

5156
02:59:51,260 --> 02:59:53,210
putting the seedlings in the rapid

5157
02:59:52,790 --> 02:59:55,431
Rooter

5158
02:59:53,209 --> 02:59:57,590
into this soil I most likely will not

5159
02:59:55,431 --> 03:00:00,021
give them nutrients at this time when i

5160
02:59:57,591 --> 03:00:02,091
put the clones into the soil at this

5161
03:00:00,021 --> 03:00:04,851
time i do like to give them a small

5162
03:00:02,091 --> 03:00:07,159
nutrient feeding i use a light

5163
03:00:04,851 --> 03:00:08,989
vegetative mix about 1/4 strength of

5164
03:00:07,159 --> 03:00:10,819
whatever brand you're using use about

5165
03:00:08,989 --> 03:00:13,011
1/4 strength of whatever they recommend

5166
03:00:10,819 --> 03:00:15,079
i also like to use a microbe product

5167
03:00:13,011 --> 03:00:16,551
again something like mammoth pee

5168
03:00:15,079 --> 03:00:18,771
something like great white shark

5169
03:00:16,550 --> 03:00:21,170
something like recharge something like

5170
03:00:18,771 --> 03:00:22,909
plus life from veg bloom anything with

5171
03:00:21,170 --> 03:00:25,069
beneficial fungus and bacteria that will

5172
03:00:22,909 --> 03:00:27,229
encourage root growth will be great for

5173
03:00:25,069 --> 03:00:28,699
your small plants so we've got our white

5174
03:00:27,229 --> 03:00:31,520
base nutrients we've got our root

5175
03:00:28,700 --> 03:00:33,500
inoculant let's talk about pH I like to

5176
03:00:31,521 --> 03:00:37,280
keep the pH for these small clones

5177
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:39,140
somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2 so we've

5178
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:41,450
got our base nutrients we've got our

5179
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:43,909
root inoculant we've got our solution pH

5180
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:45,681
now I water that solution through my

5181
03:00:43,909 --> 03:00:47,329
cups of soil just pour it right on

5182
03:00:45,681 --> 03:00:49,640
through until it drains out a little bit

5183
03:00:47,329 --> 03:00:51,470
you want to fully saturate that new soil

5184
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:53,899
now once it's done dripping and that

5185
03:00:51,470 --> 03:00:55,850
soil is fully saturated I will take two

5186
03:00:53,899 --> 03:00:57,560
fingers and just gently make a little

5187
03:00:55,851 --> 03:01:00,261
hole right in the center of that soil

5188
03:00:57,560 --> 03:01:02,181
and I go just a little bit deeper than

5189
03:01:00,261 --> 03:01:04,310
the height of that rapid Rooter so if

5190
03:01:02,181 --> 03:01:06,530
the rapid Rooter is an inch tall I go

5191
03:01:04,310 --> 03:01:09,351
maybe an inch and 1/8 or maybe an inch

5192
03:01:06,530 --> 03:01:11,989
and a quarter deep then I get the rapid

5193
03:01:09,351 --> 03:01:14,030
Rooter out of the little tray and I said

5194
03:01:11,989 --> 03:01:17,360
it gently inside of that hole and I do

5195
03:01:14,030 --> 03:01:19,700
my best to not disrupt any of those

5196
03:01:17,360 --> 03:01:21,440
roots if it's a seedling you've probably

5197
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:23,420
only got one or two roots sticking out

5198
03:01:21,440 --> 03:01:26,360
of that rapid Rooter you need to be very

5199
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:28,640
careful gently set that in the soil set

5200
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:30,710
it right inside there then backfill that

5201
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:32,329
hole really carefully over that rapid

5202
03:01:30,709 --> 03:01:34,010
Rooter I like to go right over the top

5203
03:01:32,329 --> 03:01:35,659
of it so you can never tell the rapid

5204
03:01:34,011 --> 03:01:37,159
Rooter was there and just a little plant

5205
03:01:35,659 --> 03:01:39,289
is sticking up out of the soil

5206
03:01:37,159 --> 03:01:41,239
be really careful if you're working with

5207
03:01:39,290 --> 03:01:42,650
the sealing that one tap root is all

5208
03:01:41,239 --> 03:01:44,989
it's got to survive through at this

5209
03:01:42,649 --> 03:01:47,149
point if you're working with a clone we

5210
03:01:44,989 --> 03:01:49,039
still need to be very careful with these

5211
03:01:47,149 --> 03:01:50,270
roots by the way we're rubber gloves

5212
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:51,620
when you're doing all this I highly

5213
03:01:50,271 --> 03:01:52,909
recommend rubber gloves whenever you're

5214
03:01:51,620 --> 03:01:54,410
coming in contact when you're putting

5215
03:01:52,909 --> 03:01:55,761
your hands or your skin in contact with

5216
03:01:54,409 --> 03:01:58,130
the dirt with the roots with the plant

5217
03:01:55,761 --> 03:02:00,200
just try to wear rubber gloves if you

5218
03:01:58,130 --> 03:02:02,539
can or latex gloves try to glove up

5219
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:05,301
whenever possible I would still suggest

5220
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:06,710
watering that rapid Rooter sealing with

5221
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:08,719
the spray bottle just like I

5222
03:02:06,709 --> 03:02:10,369
recommended before until it gets nice

5223
03:02:08,719 --> 03:02:12,228
and large until you were confident that

5224
03:02:10,370 --> 03:02:13,910
you're not going to drown it just water

5225
03:02:12,228 --> 03:02:16,069
it with that spray bottle make sure you

5226
03:02:13,909 --> 03:02:18,170
fully saturate the soil but it's easier

5227
03:02:16,069 --> 03:02:20,090
to not go overboard when you're spraying

5228
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:22,069
with the spray bottle because you can

5229
03:02:20,090 --> 03:02:23,659
only spray so much at a time if you're a

5230
03:02:22,069 --> 03:02:25,250
new grower and you don't have a lot of

5231
03:02:23,659 --> 03:02:27,110
experience watering plants in your new

5232
03:02:25,250 --> 03:02:28,728
watering the clones don't be afraid to

5233
03:02:27,110 --> 03:02:30,710
water them with the spray bottle also

5234
03:02:28,728 --> 03:02:32,539
just get in there and saturate that soil

5235
03:02:30,709 --> 03:02:34,279
keep spraying until you feel like it's

5236
03:02:32,540 --> 03:02:36,410
saturated and then wait until it's

5237
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:37,729
fairly dry to water it again you'll know

5238
03:02:36,409 --> 03:02:39,440
when it feels real light when you pick

5239
03:02:37,728 --> 03:02:40,969
it up you'll say oh that needs water

5240
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:43,100
then just soak it until it's mostly

5241
03:02:40,969 --> 03:02:44,329
saturated again eventually you'll

5242
03:02:43,100 --> 03:02:46,159
realize that you're spending too much

5243
03:02:44,329 --> 03:02:47,959
time using that spray bottle to water

5244
03:02:46,159 --> 03:02:50,209
the clones and you'll start using a more

5245
03:02:47,959 --> 03:02:52,969
efficient method but it's a great way to

5246
03:02:50,209 --> 03:02:56,209
learn how to not over water so I

5247
03:02:52,969 --> 03:02:58,069
basically fill my cup with soil moist in

5248
03:02:56,209 --> 03:02:59,899
the soil I make a little hole with my

5249
03:02:58,069 --> 03:03:01,940
fingers and I set that rapid Rooter

5250
03:02:59,899 --> 03:03:03,889
right inside of that hole really gently

5251
03:03:01,940 --> 03:03:06,470
really careful not to damage any of

5252
03:03:03,889 --> 03:03:08,180
those new roots then I carefully bury

5253
03:03:06,469 --> 03:03:11,659
that wrap and Rooter with the moist soil

5254
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:13,430
then I put that cup underneath a t5

5255
03:03:11,659 --> 03:03:15,110
light again I like to keep that light 8

5256
03:03:13,430 --> 03:03:16,520
to 12 inches above it when they're brand

5257
03:03:15,110 --> 03:03:18,620
new like this I don't want to scorch and

5258
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:20,149
I don't want to burn them then I like to

5259
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:23,180
keep the temperature somewhere between

5260
03:03:20,149 --> 03:03:24,889
75 and 85 degrees and I try to keep the

5261
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:27,680
room fairly humid when I have new

5262
03:03:24,889 --> 03:03:29,359
seedlings or young plants in the room so

5263
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:32,000
that is really quickly how I put my

5264
03:03:29,360 --> 03:03:34,520
rapid Rooter seedlings and clones in two

5265
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:36,889
cups of soil let's talk next about

5266
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:39,860
putting our clones from an easy cloner

5267
03:03:36,889 --> 03:03:42,829
machine or a botanic air turbo cloner in

5268
03:03:39,860 --> 03:03:45,110
two cups of soil my method for potting

5269
03:03:42,829 --> 03:03:47,059
these clones into soil starts the same

5270
03:03:45,110 --> 03:03:49,430
as potting our seeds or potting our

5271
03:03:47,059 --> 03:03:51,500
rapid rooters I start by filling my cup

5272
03:03:49,430 --> 03:03:54,260
or my desired container with a light

5273
03:03:51,500 --> 03:03:56,719
warrior or my desired soilless mix about

5274
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:59,300
a quarter inch away from the top

5275
03:03:56,719 --> 03:04:01,579
I then saturate that soil the same as I

5276
03:03:59,299 --> 03:04:03,109
did with my other cloning method I use

5277
03:04:01,579 --> 03:04:05,389
about a quarter strength of my

5278
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:08,210
vegetative new and I like to use plenty

5279
03:04:05,389 --> 03:04:12,319
of microbes then I adjust the pH between

5280
03:04:08,209 --> 03:04:14,539
5.8 and 6.2 now when we cut these clones

5281
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:16,549
I said to leave about an inch underneath

5282
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:19,130
the neoprene collar into the water

5283
03:04:16,549 --> 03:04:19,939
getting hit by that sprayer that entire

5284
03:04:19,129 --> 03:04:21,439
inch

5285
03:04:19,940 --> 03:04:23,631
should have roots popping out of here we

5286
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:26,030
should have a nice little mop of roots

5287
03:04:23,630 --> 03:04:28,039
before we try to pop these so I've got

5288
03:04:26,030 --> 03:04:30,561
my cup of moistened soil I've got a well

5289
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:32,330
rooted clone now I usually grab the cup

5290
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:34,130
with my right hand I use the pointer

5291
03:04:32,329 --> 03:04:36,289
finger on my left hand and I just poke a

5292
03:04:34,130 --> 03:04:38,539
hole about an inch and a half deep right

5293
03:04:36,290 --> 03:04:40,011
into that soil now I may widen that hole

5294
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:42,530
up a little bit depending on the root

5295
03:04:40,011 --> 03:04:44,511
mass coming off of that clone if there

5296
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:47,000
are a lot of roots I need more room I

5297
03:04:44,511 --> 03:04:49,729
don't want to crowd or crush the roots

5298
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:51,800
into that soil I like to lower the clone

5299
03:04:49,729 --> 03:04:53,989
down into the soil and let those roots

5300
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:55,789
spread as far as they can get so if

5301
03:04:53,989 --> 03:04:57,649
you've got something hanging off try not

5302
03:04:55,790 --> 03:04:59,330
to squish them try not to coil them we

5303
03:04:57,649 --> 03:05:01,909
want to encourage those roots to spread

5304
03:04:59,329 --> 03:05:04,310
out as far as they can go if you've got

5305
03:05:01,909 --> 03:05:06,409
a lot of roots maybe make a small cone

5306
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:08,300
of soil in the bottom of the cup a

5307
03:05:06,409 --> 03:05:09,979
little triangle so that the roots can

5308
03:05:08,300 --> 03:05:12,020
hit that triangle and spread out around

5309
03:05:09,979 --> 03:05:13,880
that instead of getting into a ball we

5310
03:05:12,021 --> 03:05:15,409
want the roots spread out that is really

5311
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:17,090
important if we tangle them up if we

5312
03:05:15,409 --> 03:05:18,440
twist them they'll just suffocate

5313
03:05:17,091 --> 03:05:20,060
themselves and they will kill the plant

5314
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:21,440
and the clone will not survive at all

5315
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:23,899
now if your roots have gotten

5316
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:26,120
excessively long I recommend you trim

5317
03:05:23,899 --> 03:05:28,220
some off if there are more than six or

5318
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:29,870
seven inches long just go ahead and trim

5319
03:05:28,220 --> 03:05:31,640
the bottoms of those roots off your

5320
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:33,740
plants will thank you for it they won't

5321
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:35,091
have so much root mass twist it up in

5322
03:05:33,739 --> 03:05:36,829
the bottom of that cup trying to figure

5323
03:05:35,091 --> 03:05:39,710
out what to do you'll just have a nice

5324
03:05:36,829 --> 03:05:41,030
thick root mass started and it works a

5325
03:05:39,709 --> 03:05:42,590
little bit like topping your plants

5326
03:05:41,030 --> 03:05:44,841
you've just created more sections for

5327
03:05:42,591 --> 03:05:46,640
that root zone to branch out from so

5328
03:05:44,841 --> 03:05:48,351
your plants will appreciate it so you

5329
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:50,000
pop that clone up out of the EZ cloner

5330
03:05:48,351 --> 03:05:51,650
you've got the neoprene disc you take

5331
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:53,300
the neoprene disc off you put that back

5332
03:05:51,649 --> 03:05:54,739
in the hole so the water doesn't go

5333
03:05:53,300 --> 03:05:55,970
spraying anywhere you've probably got

5334
03:05:54,739 --> 03:05:58,280
the cloner turned on while you're

5335
03:05:55,970 --> 03:06:00,261
potting the clones then you take that

5336
03:05:58,280 --> 03:06:01,641
clone and you just set it right inside

5337
03:06:00,261 --> 03:06:03,560
that hole that you've created in the

5338
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:05,449
soil but as you lower it down into there

5339
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:06,890
try to spread the roots out if they're

5340
03:06:05,450 --> 03:06:08,120
just short and stubby they're gonna go

5341
03:06:06,890 --> 03:06:09,199
the direction they want to go if they're

5342
03:06:08,120 --> 03:06:11,391
getting long enough to where you can

5343
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:13,280
stretch them or move them and encourage

5344
03:06:11,390 --> 03:06:15,140
them which direction to go try to make

5345
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:17,391
them spread out like an umbrella we want

5346
03:06:15,140 --> 03:06:20,209
to get them nice and far if they're

5347
03:06:17,390 --> 03:06:22,489
really long you can put soil in the cup

5348
03:06:20,209 --> 03:06:24,800
lower some of the roots down into the

5349
03:06:22,489 --> 03:06:26,989
cup then sprinkle more soil on top of

5350
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:28,819
that then lower more roots down into the

5351
03:06:26,989 --> 03:06:31,521
cup and then sprinkle more soil on top

5352
03:06:28,819 --> 03:06:33,149
of that then no matter how much soil you

5353
03:06:31,521 --> 03:06:35,370
use no matter how long the roots are

5354
03:06:33,149 --> 03:06:37,469
we need to bury that clone deep enough

5355
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:39,210
into this cup to give it some support to

5356
03:06:37,469 --> 03:06:40,799
stand straight up we need to get the

5357
03:06:39,209 --> 03:06:42,810
soil tight enough around it and get it

5358
03:06:40,799 --> 03:06:44,670
deep enough in there to get the clone to

5359
03:06:42,810 --> 03:06:47,101
support itself and stand straight up but

5360
03:06:44,670 --> 03:06:49,469
at the same time we need to not bury it

5361
03:06:47,101 --> 03:06:52,079
so deep that we cause a root rot on that

5362
03:06:49,469 --> 03:06:54,539
short stem that is there so we put one

5363
03:06:52,079 --> 03:06:56,039
inch of it underneath the neoprene disc

5364
03:06:54,540 --> 03:06:58,140
getting sprayed by the water so we've

5365
03:06:56,040 --> 03:07:00,061
got roots about one inch then that

5366
03:06:58,139 --> 03:07:02,069
neoprene disc is about a quarter of an

5367
03:07:00,060 --> 03:07:04,079
inch deep so I would say probably plant

5368
03:07:02,069 --> 03:07:06,299
it somewhere between one and a quarter

5369
03:07:04,079 --> 03:07:06,870
and one and a half inches deep into your

5370
03:07:06,299 --> 03:07:08,489
medium

5371
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:10,351
now we've already moistened the soil so

5372
03:07:08,489 --> 03:07:12,601
the nutrients are in there the next

5373
03:07:10,351 --> 03:07:15,601
thing to do is to move our potted clones

5374
03:07:12,601 --> 03:07:17,700
underneath a t5 light again for freshly

5375
03:07:15,601 --> 03:07:20,550
potted plants I like to keep that t5

5376
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:22,680
about 8 to 12 inches away I will lower

5377
03:07:20,549 --> 03:07:24,179
that light as the plants get stronger I

5378
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:25,860
just don't want to move them right under

5379
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:27,450
there right away and scorch them and

5380
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:29,790
burn them and give them the opportunity

5381
03:07:27,450 --> 03:07:31,680
to stress out for these new baby clones

5382
03:07:29,790 --> 03:07:34,860
I like to keep the temperature between

5383
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:36,659
75 and 85 degrees and I do like high

5384
03:07:34,860 --> 03:07:38,340
humidity it depends on how much airflow

5385
03:07:36,659 --> 03:07:39,569
I've got in the room it depends on my

5386
03:07:38,340 --> 03:07:41,909
environment it depends on the situation

5387
03:07:39,569 --> 03:07:43,770
if I've got plenty of airflow if I can

5388
03:07:41,909 --> 03:07:45,329
have air exchange I will put higher

5389
03:07:43,771 --> 03:07:46,771
humidity in the room if I feel like

5390
03:07:45,329 --> 03:07:48,959
there's not a lot of airflow and it will

5391
03:07:46,771 --> 03:07:51,480
create problems I will reduce the

5392
03:07:48,959 --> 03:07:53,100
humidity accordingly I know I keep

5393
03:07:51,479 --> 03:07:54,180
stressing it but the most important

5394
03:07:53,101 --> 03:07:56,250
thing to think about when you are

5395
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:58,409
potting these clones from the easy

5396
03:07:56,250 --> 03:08:00,930
cloner from the turbo corner is to not

5397
03:07:58,409 --> 03:08:02,430
let those dangly roots wrap up on

5398
03:08:00,930 --> 03:08:03,960
themselves don't let them by and don't

5399
03:08:02,430 --> 03:08:06,271
let them smother themselves don't let

5400
03:08:03,959 --> 03:08:08,579
him suffocate themselves these cloning

5401
03:08:06,271 --> 03:08:10,050
machines can make roots explode you look

5402
03:08:08,579 --> 03:08:11,729
in there on day five and you won't have

5403
03:08:10,049 --> 03:08:13,409
any roots you look in there on day six

5404
03:08:11,729 --> 03:08:14,819
you'll be getting roots you'll go away

5405
03:08:13,409 --> 03:08:16,590
for the weekend you'll come back over

5406
03:08:14,819 --> 03:08:18,119
the weekend on Monday the roots are

5407
03:08:16,590 --> 03:08:19,889
hanging down into the water they go

5408
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:21,601
crazy very quickly

5409
03:08:19,889 --> 03:08:23,520
you will see what I'm talking about when

5410
03:08:21,601 --> 03:08:25,980
you get it dialed in don't take those

5411
03:08:23,521 --> 03:08:28,170
fat clones with big crazy roots and kill

5412
03:08:25,979 --> 03:08:30,420
them by suffocating them by coiling them

5413
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:32,729
up in your soil all right so at this

5414
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:35,399
point we've got a bunch of seedlings or

5415
03:08:32,729 --> 03:08:37,560
a bunch of clones in small pots or cups

5416
03:08:35,399 --> 03:08:39,029
we've got them underneath t5 lights or

5417
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:41,101
whatever light you've got available

5418
03:08:39,030 --> 03:08:44,101
maybe you've got an LED maybe you've got

5419
03:08:41,101 --> 03:08:45,890
a small HPS maybe a 250 or a 400 if

5420
03:08:44,101 --> 03:08:47,600
you're using something larger that works

5421
03:08:45,889 --> 03:08:49,430
just keep it further away just raise it

5422
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:51,309
up real high so he's got it under an

5423
03:08:49,430 --> 03:08:54,109
acceptable light we've got it in a

5424
03:08:51,309 --> 03:08:56,689
desirable climate which is around 75 to

5425
03:08:54,109 --> 03:08:58,158
85 degrees with the appropriate humidity

5426
03:08:56,689 --> 03:09:00,529
hopefully you've got somewhere between

5427
03:08:58,158 --> 03:09:01,488
50 and 75 percent humidity for your

5428
03:09:00,529 --> 03:09:04,158
small plants

5429
03:09:01,488 --> 03:09:07,158
I would suggest either 24 hours on or

5430
03:09:04,158 --> 03:09:09,500
possibly 20 on and 4 off or a lot of

5431
03:09:07,158 --> 03:09:12,889
people like to do 18 hours on and 6

5432
03:09:09,500 --> 03:09:15,170
hours off for our new small plants also

5433
03:09:12,889 --> 03:09:17,329
I would recommend a white fan on these

5434
03:09:15,170 --> 03:09:19,100
plants just a fan to keep the air moving

5435
03:09:17,329 --> 03:09:21,559
around them will prevent the plants from

5436
03:09:19,100 --> 03:09:23,930
getting leggy and stretchy and I think

5437
03:09:21,559 --> 03:09:26,119
it just makes tougher more robust plants

5438
03:09:23,930 --> 03:09:28,220
when you put a little breeze on them so

5439
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:30,859
at this point the clones are now in our

5440
03:09:28,219 --> 03:09:33,079
small veg phase in a very short time

5441
03:09:30,859 --> 03:09:35,510
those seedlings will catch up to what I

5442
03:09:33,079 --> 03:09:37,939
consider the small veggies which is when

5443
03:09:35,510 --> 03:09:39,620
they are about 6 inches tall and they've

5444
03:09:37,939 --> 03:09:41,779
got a couple of nice sets of leaves and

5445
03:09:39,620 --> 03:09:44,479
they can start taking small veg

5446
03:09:41,779 --> 03:09:47,779
nutrients I plan on doing a complete

5447
03:09:44,478 --> 03:09:50,000
episode on small veg here in the very

5448
03:09:47,779 --> 03:09:51,800
near future that episode will include

5449
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:53,629
recommended light cycles for your veg

5450
03:09:51,799 --> 03:09:55,639
plant that episode will include

5451
03:09:53,629 --> 03:09:57,948
recommended nutrient schedules for your

5452
03:09:55,639 --> 03:09:59,599
veg plants I'll also talk about optimal

5453
03:09:57,949 --> 03:10:01,520
environmental conditions for your small

5454
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:03,109
veg plants then we'll talk about

5455
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:04,939
transplanting our plants into their

5456
03:10:03,109 --> 03:10:07,488
finishing pots and we will consider that

5457
03:10:04,939 --> 03:10:10,609
large veg and then we will begin to talk

5458
03:10:07,488 --> 03:10:11,869
about our large veg phase ladies and

5459
03:10:10,609 --> 03:10:14,090

want to thank you again for listening to

5477
03:10:47,299 --> 03:10:50,809
the podcast I know this was sort of a

5478
03:10:49,250 --> 03:10:52,670
short episode but I feel like I did a

5479
03:10:50,809 --> 03:10:54,559
good lesson I taught you well how to

5480
03:10:52,670 --> 03:10:56,029
transplant your new babies I feel like

5481
03:10:54,559 --> 03:10:57,920
there was not a lot of fluff or a lot of

5482
03:10:56,029 --> 03:10:59,450
BS to filter through I feel like a lot

5483
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:01,431
of people can learn from this one

5484
03:10:59,450 --> 03:11:03,050
and that is the point so short and sweet

5485
03:11:01,431 --> 03:11:05,450
right to the point we served our purpose

5486
03:11:03,049 --> 03:11:07,250
I think Mike is on his way over so we

5487
03:11:05,450 --> 03:11:08,811
will record a long and rambly episode

5488
03:11:07,250 --> 03:11:10,729
that will make up for the short episode

5489
