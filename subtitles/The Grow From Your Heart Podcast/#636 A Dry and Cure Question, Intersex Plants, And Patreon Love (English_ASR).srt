75 of the time your rosin tastes like a

169
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,360
popsicle stick or burnt popcorn

170
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,279
and i cannot stand the [ __ ] flavor of

171
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
a popsicle stick on my tongue if you put

172
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,638
a tongue depressor on my tongue

173
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,038
popsicle stick on my tongue i can feel

174
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
it in my bones in my body right now this

175
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,519
weird

176
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,120
ah they call it the chills it's an

177
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,319
uncomfortable [ __ ] feeling

178
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,918
i got i don't know if you call it

179
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,519
chicken skins or goosebumps whatever the

180
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,599
[ __ ] you call it wherever you are

181
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,959
my skin's crawling doing weird [ __ ] i

182
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,439
don't like a tongue depressor i don't

183
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,000
like that

184
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
unfinished wood texture in my mouth it's

185
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,279
disgusting

186
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,038
a lot of times that's what rosin tastes

187
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,839
like to me burnt popcorn and the tongue

188
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,360
depressor

189
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,599
and it makes my tongue and my face make

190
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
this terrible shape i go oh

191
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
and you can tell by looking that it

192
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,000
looks like i just took a bite of poop

193
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
uh it's not pleasant anyway i did take a

194
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
dab of some rosin

195
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
the past couple of days that was made by

196
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
a friend that was uh a gift that we

197
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
can't talk too much about

198
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
how it landed here and who got it to me

199
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
however

200
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,199
they know who they are i talked about

201
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,879
another product in a previous episode my

202
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,800
friend wondered if this was him

203
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,800
this time bro i am talking about your

204
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
rosin the [ __ ] was good it was tasty

205
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
i got a nice buzz from it it was heavy

206
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,240
on the lungs and the flavor changed

207
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
so many times there were two jars one

208
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,079
honestly is not my favorite but it's

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,478
smokable the other one i went back for

210
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,359
more so i do approve i do enjoy the

211
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,279
rosin

212
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
uh you guys are getting better the rosin

213
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,719
makers are getting better at making

214
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
rosin is what i've noticed

215
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
you're learning the temperatures the

216
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
times the techniques it's all being

217
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,318
dialed in

218
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,919
and it's getting better that being said

219
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,759
i'm still a batter fan

220
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,918
there's nothing uh nothing better than

221
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
some good green dot batter they do not

222
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,038
pay me to say that actually

223
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
i just go buy all my products at the

224
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,318
dispensary just like you do green dot

225
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
doesn't email me message me we have no

226
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
relationship

227
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,199
good product all right uh the reason i'm

228
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,360
stoned is rambly is because

229
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
of the um i can't think of the name of

230
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
the strain that i smoked but it was some

231
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
rosin

232
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
and it was delicious it'll come to me i

233
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,279
think it was some i don't want to say

234
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,038
the wrong one

235
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,638
i know what it was my brain will not

236
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,159
allow me to say it by the end of this

237
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,120
episode maybe i'll remember or i'll

238
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
press pause

239
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720

242
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000

418
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,759

419
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
i'm grateful for each and every one of

420
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,439
you

421
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,000
but it is hard to give each and every

422
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,920
one of you

423
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
undivided attention so if you've sent me

424
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,879
an email if you've sent me a request

425
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,240

428
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
my long dreadlocks

429

432
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,199
ridiculous and unmanageable

433
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,439
i'm trying i'm doing my best you guys i

434
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
get so many messages patreon becomes a

435
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
priority of course because you do send

436
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,000
funding with that

437
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
i feel like if you send money i should

438
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,039
pay attention to you first you paid for

439
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
me to look at the messages

440
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,240
i do what i don't want is people to

441
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,078
think that they're giving me

442
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,879
uh financial support and i'm ignoring

443

453

distract me just to get me focused i'll

454
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
take a couple of dabs to get me in the

455
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,159

what happens

462

00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,439
this message goes

538
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,519
i do have a few ideas for episodes

539
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
i like that this one says i've got a two

540
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759
by four a two foot by four foot not a

541
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
two inch by four inch but a two foot by

542
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
four foot

543
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,799
dry and cured tent so they've taken a

544
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,919
grow tent and they've modified it and

545
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,159
set it up to be

546
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,240
their drying space they're drying their

547
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,439
chopped down flowers in this tint

548
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,879
it says i have now found that if you use

549
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
a 2x4 tint

550
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,278
with exhaust you can exhaust with a duct

551
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,879
fan into a four inch carbon filter for

552
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,639
like five to ten days

553
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,720
the plants are hanging down during this

554
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,120
period then you can take them off the

555
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,440
strings use plastic bins and leave them

556
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,440
in there just uh then take them off the

557
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
strings leave them just enough of a stem

558
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
to trim with then let them sit in the

559
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,320
same environment

560
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
with the plastic bins on the ground for

561
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,639
five to ten more days

562
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,720
then trim it and jar it burp we burp for

563
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
three weeks daily leaving in the tent

564
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
this method has worked well and is

565
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,000
simple and easy

566
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
uh that's a great idea that is a great

567
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
way to use a grotin

568
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,839
a lot of us are growing in the grow tent

569
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
and don't have a place to dry and cure

570
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,519
that tent that you grew in would be

571
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,959
perfect just modify it a little bit

572
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,159
don't turn on the light because we don't

573
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,239
need the light

574
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,679
just like our friend said use an exhaust

575
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,799
so that you're sucking out all that

576
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,319
stale air

577
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,480
use a carbon filter so you're not

578
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,480
spreading that intense aroma around

579
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,078
because once you harvest the smell is

580
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
[ __ ] intense once you start rustling

581
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,438
those trichomes around moving the plants

582
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,439
around it really gets stinky

583
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,880
so you got your grow tint you got your

584
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,160
carbon filter you got your blower in

585
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,439
there you're sucking out the stale air

586
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,199
you're bringing in fresh air

587
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
a little bit of air movement is good not

588
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
ridiculous air movement in there you

589
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,839
don't want it blowing on those plants

590
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,438
but yeah you've got the right idea

591
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,759
they're hanging upside down which is

592
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,679
ideal uh take them off the string use

593
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,359
clean plastic bins and leave just enough

594
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,160
of a stem to trim with that

595
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,279
sounds ideal to me basically similar to

596
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
what we would do in a commercial

597
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,200
environment i'll talk on that in a

598
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,038
second

599
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,200
let them sit in the same environment in

600
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,480
the plastic bins on the ground yes

601
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
something the only thing you're not

602
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
doing that i do in a commercial

603
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,439
environment

604
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
is i put a humidifier and a dehumidifier

605
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
in that room

606
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
i don't use a tent i have a room uh with

607
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
locks and cameras and [ __ ] but

608
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,080
i put those device i put a humidifier

609
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
and dehumidifier in the same room

610
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,359
and set them both at 50 percent and let

611
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
them [ __ ] fight

612
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,558
that way it is always 50 humidity in

613
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
that room

614
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,480
if you can control the uh temperature

615
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,840
that would be ideal as well i understand

616
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,200
this is in your home

617
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,000
uh but it sounds like you're doing the

618
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,919
right thing um leave them for

619
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so you've got them hanging for five to

620
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,360
ten days on the ground for five to ten

621
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,359
more days that's gonna be

622
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,879
14 20ish days that's right about the

623
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,519
right time period

624
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,400
then trim it and jar it then burp three

625
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,879
weeks daily

626
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,160
leaving in the tent um at this point you

627
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
could take them out of the tent if you

628
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
wanted to

629
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
put them on a shelf or whatever but if

630
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,918
you want to leave them in the tent

631
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,079
that's cool

632
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,000
uh this method has worked well and is

633
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,119
simple and easy yes that's a great idea

634
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
because

635
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,558
a lot of people don't have drank your

636
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,840
space they did not plan for that they

637
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,038
did not prep for that they don't know

638
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,519
where they're going to do it so that

639
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,359
tent

640
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,038
is a great space why not just utilize

641
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,038
that space you've already paid rent

642
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,558
already bought the gear it may slow you

643
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,160
down two weeks on your next crop

644
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,000
but if you're not looking for production

645
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,679
if you're just running this small crop

646
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,519
that is a beautiful idea since the

647
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,360
eleven thank you for the great idea

648
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,720
um if you got any more questions brother

649
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,399
i do look forward

650
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,000
to hearing from you guys use that space

651
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,519
you've got guys and gals

652
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,519
use the space you've got the only thing

653
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,079
i would do differently uh i would add

654
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,279
that humidifier and dehumidifier but uh

655
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,480
you might be in just the right area to

656
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,000
where you don't need to do that i've got

657
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,279
an area in my basement that is perfect

658
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,798
for drying and curing plants i don't

659
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,558
have to add or subtract anything the

660
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,798
plants just [ __ ] love it so

661
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,160
sometimes we get lucky alright i do have

662
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,759
another question this one

663
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,320
says if not bad genetics what causes

664
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,519
hermaphrodites or intersex traits that

665
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,839
is a very

666
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,839
very good question most of the time if

667
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,759
we see intersex traits in a plant we

668
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,359
immediately blame genetics it's either

669
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,359
genetics or grower right those are the

670
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,119
two things it could have been

671
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,439
but there's something we often overlook

672
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,038
and my buddy james bean calls it

673
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,558
the jurassic park effect and i

674
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,160
completely agree with that

675
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:53,440
um the bottom line is life finds

676
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,600
a way ah cannabis is an annual plant

677
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,558
that is designed to live for one season

678
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,439
it's supposed to veg flower produce

679
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,399
seeds

680
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,798
die the seeds grow next year annual plan

681
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,880
one season one year

682
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,000
we have developed plants that don't

683
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
produce pollen

684
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,599
and don't produce any seeds because they

685
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,639
are cincimillia plants we take them

686
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,519
we've taken the males out of the

687
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,919
equation

688
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,679
there's no seeds in the female plants

689
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
these plants know there's no seeds they

690
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
know they're not getting pollen a female

691
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,480
plant's whole

692
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,558
goal in life is to get pollinated that's

693
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,960
all she wants it's her sole purpose

694
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,759
is to get pollinated and make seeds so

695
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
that we can

696
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,359
can continue this uh generation or this

697
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,799
bran this uh seed line however whatever

698
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,519
label you want to put on it this brand

699
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,440
of seeds

700
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,558
can continue for generations and

701
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,798
generations

702
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,678
the male plant's whole idea is to drop

703
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,759
loads of pollen

704
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,360
on those female plants to continue his

705
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,000
bloodline that's why the male plant gets

706
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,240
taller

707
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,759
the pollen falls down the female plants

708
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,640
are lower they receive the pollen they

709
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,119
make seeds

710
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
the season ends they either get frozen

711
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,399
they fall to the ground and die the wind

712
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,839
drops them down the birds eat them [ __ ]

713
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,759
out the seeds somewhere else

714
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,359
seeds are scattered randomly chaotically

715
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,919
just like pollen

716
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,639
so that's not happening in our grow

717
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
rooms

718
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
it's just simply not happening we don't

719
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,038
have birds we don't have bees

720
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,119
uh we don't have a lot of things

721
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,640
happening in there these plants know the

722
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,399
female plants are like

723
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,120
[ __ ] horny i've been in this room for

724
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
this many weeks i've been in flour

725
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,000
around week three i really should have

726
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
got jizz done and got filled up with

727
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,679
seeds but that didn't happen

728
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,079
i'm like nine weeks into flour my

729
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,600
trichomes are ripe my leaves are weird

730
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,960
the season changed in here he's got it

731
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,959
nice and cold he changed the [ __ ]

732
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,759
light cycle i don't know what to do i'm

733
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,759
gonna die

734
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,839
and i didn't get pollinated so i'm not

735
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,240
gonna get to make babies

736
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,000
watch this and so that plant just goes

737
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
boink and it makes a [ __ ] seed

738
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
because

739
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,840
life finds a way just like jurassic park

740
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,600
bro they only had female plants but or

741
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,639
they only had female dinosaurs but

742
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,639
somehow one of them female dinosaurs

743
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
some immaculate conceptions some

744
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,120
some biblical [ __ ] happen and there are

745
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,240
more dinosaurs cannabis plants work just

746
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,639
like that they will

747
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,759
create their own seeds they will create

748
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,440
their own pollen

749
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,839
uh there are ways to make this happen

750
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,440
also um what causes herms

751
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,158
so stress will do it uh bad genetics

752
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
will do it

753
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
over feeding underfeeding terrible

754
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,559
environment will do it

755
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,840
but letting it go way too long will also

756
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,240
do it if you let if that plant should

757
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,759
have been

758
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,319
chopped down at week 8 and you let it go

759
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,359
to week 10 or 11 it will hermaphrodite

760
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,279
on you

761
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,599
a lot of things can contribute to

762
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,119
intersex traits and hermaphroditism

763
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,558
it should have been washed out in the

764
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,199
breeding it should have been selected

765
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,200
better

766
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,798
that should have been uh before we gave

767
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
you seeds or spread them out we should

768
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,918
have realized there's a trait in there

769
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,679
that needs to be bred out or

770
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,640
the seeds need to be tossed but

771
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,840
any plant has the opportunity to uh show

772
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,038
an intersex trait

773
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,839
it has got the will to survive life will

774
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,440
find a way

775
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,439
and shout out to my buddy james bean for

776
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
coining that jurassic park term

777
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
i don't know if he made that up but that

778
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,919
is who i heard it from life

779
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,558
will find a way just like jurassic park

780
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
so

781
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,879
um if not bad genetics what are some

782
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,559
causes of hermaphrodites the will to

783
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
survive bro is the main

784
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,720
cause for hermaphrodites it's not just

785
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
bad genetics sometimes grower error

786
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,558
you have to keep in mind that a lot of

787
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,440
the chem dog stuff a lot of the og stuff

788
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,599
is prone to being hermaphroditic to

789
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,600
showing intersex traits it's up to us to

790
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,038
not give it the opportunity we know that

791
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,599
certain things in the room will trigger

792
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,440
that

793
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,000
over feeding it under feeding it too

794
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,320
much cold drastic temperature swings

795
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,359
[ __ ] like that stress at all will cause

796
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,759
a chem 91

797
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,079
or a real old-school og kush plant to

798
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,158
just go herm on you over watering it

799
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,918
over watering an og kush plant can cause

800
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,278
it to turn into an intersex plant it

801
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,360
already was intersex

802
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,480
it'll cause it to show the intersex

803
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,000
trait so

804
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,000
a lot of things can trigger that you can

805
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
grow a plant several several times

806
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,519
and just one new thing can really piss

807
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,080
it off and make it display

808
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,960
that intersex trait for you all right

809
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,879
i've got one more

810
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,558
great message this is a good one it's

811
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,640
kind of a long message i'm going to cut

812
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,839
to the chase once i start reading it

813
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
i don't know if they want their name

814
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,918
said because i do

815
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,439
you'll understand why it says i hope you

816
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
uh this finds you well

817
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,200
i've had issues maintaining a constant

818
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
temperature and keeping humidity up in

819
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,240
my tents

820
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
i will set the stage for you to better

821
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,359
help you wrap your head around this

822
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,960
problem i like that approach

823
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,479
i will end with the steps i plan on

824
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
taking to look forward

825
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,079
uh look i will end with the steps i plan

826
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,000
on taking and

827
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,119
i look forward to hearing from your

828
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
expertise

829
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,599
so this is a great way to set up an

830
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,519
email it says i have two tents in a room

831
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,839
uh that is as sealed as can be while

832
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,558
maintaining an inconspicuous outside

833
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,798
view that's

834
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,558
[ __ ] understandable in my veg tin i

835
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,158
have two leds and then we talk a little

836
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,798
bit about the grow

837
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,880
then we come to the main problem of the

838
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,759
grow the room itself has

839
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,720
temperature fluctuations um we can't get

840
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,119
the room

841
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
much lower than 83 degrees i've taken

842
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,639
more of a macgyver approach for this

843
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
problem and i would like to avoid

844
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,480
bringing in ac units expensive

845
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
regulators and so on but

846
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,880
if that's what it has to be then so be

847
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,640
it it says so far my steps have been

848
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
placing buckets of water with an air

849
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,720
pump and stone in the tents

850
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
that's not going to make it cool you

851
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,798
need cool says i moved my flower tent to

852
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,759
the coldest part of the room away from

853
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,839
the basic

854
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,158
radiator to have to maintain minimum

855
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,599
heat which it obviously didn't work

856
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
then it says i'm a brand new grower and

857
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,639
i've listened to your collection of grow

858
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
tips four times

859
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,600
and i would like to have a nice setup

860
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,640
before i start my new seeds any

861
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,678
criticism

862
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,400
is appreciated and keep it up um

863
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,880
so i had a lot to say about this message

864
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
and then

865
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,200
i just cut right to the chase i was like

866
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
bro you can do all kinds of magic you

867
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
can hope and pray

868
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
you can move [ __ ] around the answer is

869
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,440
buy an air conditioner why are you

870
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,278
dodging an air conditioner

871
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
you can make this job as hard as you

872
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,038
want you can make this grow as

873
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
challenging as you want on yourself or

874
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:55,679
you already said it i could buy an air

875
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
conditioner you've already brought

876
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,400
buckets into the room and put bubblers

877
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,759
and [ __ ] in there

878
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
you're moving things around you're

879
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,240
trying to do macgyver tricks

880
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,759
why not go to the store and buy the air

881
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,599
conditioner and install the ac

882
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,000
so i said uh um buy the air conditioner

883
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,759
bro

884
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
and then he said an update i buckled and

885
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,319
got a regular ac

886
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,559
unit and i said uh sorry for the slow

887
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,879
reply but you have made the correct move

888
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,558
sometimes in a grow environment you have

889
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
just got to bite the bullet and get the

890
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,639
correct gear you can try

891
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,038
to macgyver stuff you can duct tape

892
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
stuff you can rig stuff up however you

893
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,200
want

894
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,519
but every bud you grow every half-assed

895
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,080
larvae fluffy nugget that you produce

896
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,599
is going to show that your grow room was

897
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,918
not what it could have been

898
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,639
you know your flaw you know your weakest

899
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
link

900
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,679
why are you gonna let that weak link

901
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,079
that [ __ ] in the armor

902
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,278
the [ __ ] the weak part be the weak

903
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,480
part you know it

904
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,839
that's fix that you did you did you

905
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
stepped up and i'm just saying anybody

906
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,278
out there who's thinking like this

907
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,558
ah it is springtime it's about to go

908
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,240
into summertime

909
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,000
it's not the time to be cheap now is the

910
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,440
time to get the dehumidifier you need

911
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,519
the air conditioner you need

912
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,960
get that room dialed in properly you're

913
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,679
growing medicine you're growing a

914
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,400
product

915
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,400
you want high quality when i worked at

916
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,919
guitar center i used this to explain

917
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,600
things to customers you could buy a

918
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
cheap-ass guitar if you want

919
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,879
but it's going to hurt the kids fingers

920
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,319
it's going to sound like [ __ ] it's never

921
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,520
going to be fun to play

922
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,000
you're never going to sound like

923
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,240
metallica on that shit-ass guitar

924
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
or you could step it up and not buy the

925
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,278
lowest level

926
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,798
you could buy a guitar center it goes

927
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,640
good better best you could buy

928
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,839
better you could buy the medium range

929
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
guitar where it doesn't kill your

930
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,439
fingers every time you play

931
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,959
and it's got potential to have good tone

932
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,480
it's not going to fall apart

933
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,079
it's not going to come out of tune every

934
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,319
time you hit the [ __ ] strings

935
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,398
get the better don't get the the shitty

936
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,480
one the good one get the better one so

937
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,319
that you actually enjoy growing

938
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,919
your your goal here is to produce a

939
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,158
product but also

940
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,600
growing can be very therapeutic for me

941
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,039
being in the grow room

942
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,519
i don't answer the phone if i'm in the

943
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:01,038
grow room and anybody calls

944
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,319
it maybe if the daughter calls because

945
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,798
my daughter might need something i'll

946
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,119
answer for

947
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,918
anybody else uh the girlfriend the

948
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,079
company

949
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,120
the banker the accountant i don't answer

950
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,038
for them that's

951
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,639
i'm in the garden dude that is my zen

952
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,119
space that is my moment

953
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,440
that is my area you can't [ __ ] with me

954
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,038
and if i just cheap-assed it and used a

955
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,640
shitty half-assed piece of gear in there

956
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,319
i wouldn't have any pride in it

957
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,320
and it wouldn't feel zen when i was in

958
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,278
there so put a lot of pride into it and

959
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,879
also understand that

960
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,038
this is a budget issue for a lot of

961
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,799
people but don't cheap out

962
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,158
you're buying other things i bet you

963
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,639
like maybe just don't buy

964
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,000
that playstation game or that xbox game

965
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
did i [ __ ] say that that's like me

966
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,839
saying don't buy that one pair of

967
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
sneakers

968
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,240
so that you can buy that air conditioner

969
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,359
but you know what i'm buying the

970
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,798
sneakers now

971
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,639
because i bought all the air

972
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,000
conditioners already and they're running

973
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,240
and the rooms are working

974
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,720
so i know things are where they need to

975
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
be and in turn the business is working

976
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,759
so since i put the money in

977
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,519
there's money coming out i can buy the

978
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,359
sneakers now you got to put the money in

979
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,440
to get the product out you want my point

980
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,479
is if you're going to do this [ __ ]

981
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,080
have pride in it have 100 pride

982
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,278
if you go in there and you just half-ass

983
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,839
it and the product comes out and you're

984
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,759
half-assed

985
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,359
when you smoke it it'll be a half-assed

986
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,919
product you'll have half-assed pride in

987
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,839
it

988
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,360
anything that you grow and you smoke and

989
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,959
you consume that you put pride into

990
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,319
you're gonna feel a better buzz more

991
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
pride when you consume it

992
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,839
so put pride in there we've talked about

993
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,000
