thanks for all the great birthday love

128
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,270
and support also last week I put out an

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,730
episode which featured a very highly

130
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,339
medicated white Mike and we let Mike

131
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,189
ramble for a good 40 minutes and I got a

132
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:50,529
lot of response to that episode so on

133
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:53,800
Mike's behalf big thank you

134
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:56,079
we both love and appreciate the comments

135
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,300
and the support and the response and the

136
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,069
reaction I can't speak for Mike when I

137
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,560
say that that means a lot to me that's

138
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,480
really energizing and really refueling

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,459
and it's motivating it keeps us going

140
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,569
I'm pretty sure Mike would agree with

141
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,549
that but I don't want to put words in

142
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:11,439
his mouth but I can say that Mike says

143
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,509
thank you because that stuff does mean a

144
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,279
lot to us so thank you for all of the

145
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,370

health in check you're on the right path

166
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,230
I'm gonna brag I haven't had soda and

167
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,139
I've had very minimal sugar and caffeine

168
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,080
for almost two and a half weeks now and

169
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,669
I feel [Â __Â ] amazing you guys if

170
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,589
you're one of those caffeine people I

171
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,420
was a caffeine people and I would

172
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:11,829
overload myself on caffeine and the only

173
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,110
thing that I thought would give me some

174
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,550
more energy was more caffeine and now

175
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,920
that I'm not consuming caffeine I've

176
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,270
never had more [Â __Â ] energy so if

177
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,009
you're fighting that caffeine battle

178
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,539
you're never gonna win you may have to

179
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,370
clean your [Â __Â ] up and stop doing that

180
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,740
I'm not gonna brag about my dietary

181
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,689
accomplishments but I felt proud wanted

182
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,490
to share mainly big shout-out to Mike

183
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,160

184
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,590

185
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,180

186
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,769

198
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,129
made good friends with an LED company

199
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,860
and they have decided to offer me some

200
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,110
lights to run in a grow environment so I

201
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,879
have recently hung up some cannon LEDs

202
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,259
from our friends at black sail Market

203
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,240

LED companies out there and you were

210
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,860
standing out so that takes effort I'm

211
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,959
going to run these LEDs and I will give

212

213

I made friends with the guy over there

214
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,600
and it is important to me that I give my

215
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:34,659
friend honest feedback even if these

216

217
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,530

218
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,389
I'm not gonna butter anything up I'm

219
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,159

220
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,410
tell you that the moment I plug them in

221
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,300
I said holy [Â __Â ] those are bright and

222
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,530
then I invited Dumbledore Matt over and

223
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,240
I go pro look at these [Â __Â ] lights

224
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,888
and I plugged him in and he just put his

225
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,930
hands over his eyes and he's like [Â __Â ]

226
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,370
dude like he was blinded for a couple of

227
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,840
minutes and it was able isn't trying to

228
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,538
kill anybody they're just so bright that

229
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,549
it's overwhelming even for a grower who

230
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:03,819
has been in a grow room all the time

231

[Â __Â ] mood alright we're going to read

260
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,669
a couple of emails that some folks have

261
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,610
sent us I really enjoy producing what I

262
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:00,199
call listened or generated content that

263
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,639
way I know that I'm answering at least

264
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,560
one person's question out there at least

265
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,269
one person needs some help and I figure

266
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,189
if one person has this question and they

267
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,230
had the motivation to just write a

268
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,700
simple email to me and ask me I figure

269
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,320
if one person sent me the question

270
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,420
there's got to be at least 10 people out

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
there asking maybe 20 who knows maybe a

272
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,199
hundred people out there with the same

273
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,120
exact question as this one person who

274
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,730
ever sending whatever email so I love

275
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,289
creating listener generated content I

276
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,330
know I'm helping that's my point here

277
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,949
I'm [Â __Â ] ramble you guys I kind of

278

279
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,550

281
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:36,409

282
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,269

283
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,549
first email on today's episode goes a

284
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:42,289
little bit like this it says Rasta Jeff

285
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,419
I was hoping I would get a chance to

286
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,730
catch you out at the DGC bus and do some

287
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,679
dabs you and Scotty real are the only

288
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,509
people that I follow closely and I

289
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,149
didn't get to smoke with I met Scotty

290
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:56,419
too though and he gave me and my fiance

291
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,340
a DGC t-shirt which was really cool so

292
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,889
this is my friend giant Mike he was at

293
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,070
the Indo Expo and he was hoping that I

294
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,750
would be able to go out and smoke at the

295
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,510
DGC bus because my friends if the dude

296
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,340
grows crew that is the dude from the

297

298
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,450
can't leave out guru and there are so

299
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,920
many folks in the DGC now that I can't

300
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,020
even start listing people but we got to

301
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,699
mention junior token and maestro and I'm

302
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,960
sure I'm gonna miss somebody I apologize

303
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,030

304
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,639
don't worry I told you I took dabs but

305
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,559
the DGC crew the dude grows gang they

306
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,710
got a smoke bus which was equipped with

307
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,929
rigs and seats and air conditioning and

308
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,509
they were outside dabbing out while I

309
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:37,009
was inside busting my ass at the I read

310
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,639
genetics booth I'm just kidding it's not

311
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,230
busting my ass

312
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,689
I work up a sweat and I talk up a storm

313
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,850
but it is nothing but fun for me the

314
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,530
entire time at that Expo but my friend

315
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,750
is saying that he was wishing he could

316
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,589
catch me at the bus I never made it to

317
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,860
the bus

318
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,019
I used the gender-specific vape lounge

319
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,730
which was a few feet from my booth but

320
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,220
other than that I did not get to do much

321
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,590
medicating and I really did not venture

322
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,360
out from my booth during the event much

323
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,160
at all I think I used the restroom and

324
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,810
that gender-specific Bay plunge which

325
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,000
may have been the same little room right

326
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,859
there which was ironic so I did not make

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,019
it out to the bus is my point the

328
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,269
message goes on to say we were surprised

329
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,179
how cool everyone was and how they

330
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,159
welcomed us with open arms yes that

331
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,299
event was a kind of like a family

332
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,189
gathering I've been going to those

333
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,379

350
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:51,169
people and our friends that come to see

351
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,850
us especially our friends that come to

352
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,139
see us from far away our friends that

353
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,120
have been supporting us for a long time

354
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,830
we've got to show you love the message

355
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,560
goes on to say I watch the embracing

356
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,590
organics show regularly and if you guys

357
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,879
aren't aware I am on another podcast at

358
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,280
least every other week and it's called

359
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,990
embracing organics it's on YouTube I try

360
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,000
to be there every week but I stay busy

361
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,250
so I've been doing every other week just

362
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,740
to keep myself fresh on there embracing

363
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,710
organics is a youtube show it is live on

364
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,750
YouTube every Thursday I'm in Mountain

365
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,629
the mountain time zone so for myself it

366
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,090
is 7 p.m. we started about 7:10 where as

367
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,340
we're all stoners it's about 7:10 7:15

368
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,910
when we get going live we go for about 2

369
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,009
hours

370
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:32,719
the show stays up on YouTube so if you

371
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,669
don't catch it live you can watch all

372
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,769
the embracing organics episodes but I'm

373
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,659
on that show quite regularly I try to

374
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,338
contribute my breeding and cultivation

375
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,049
knowledge to that show it's a great show

376
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,339
I've built a lot of great friends and a

377
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,379
lot of great relationships from that

378
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,960
show but it says I watch the embracing

379
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:50,179
organic show regularly and I sat down

380
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,470
and did dabs with Keith Keith that's the

381
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,809
second time you got a shout out on the

382
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,310
show bro and smoked with stabby and the

383
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,619
rest of the panel big shot it's my buddy

384
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,899
stabby McNab wood we shot the [Â __Â ] with

385
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,909
Tennessee many times and was even gonna

386
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:04,039
meet up later in the week to hang out

387
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:06,350
- nah see but you got caught up with the

388
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,929
funk at the Expo yeah some people do get

389
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,790
that Expo look flu that cup cough sort

390
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,709
of stuff that does happen I think that

391
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,719
same look flu tried to kill Scottie real

392
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,090
it took down a couple of people I think

393
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,620
I have become immune to the work flu I

394
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,420
don't get the cup cough I don't get sick

395
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,830
from those events anymore I seem to do

396
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,479
all right I used to come back [Â __Â ]

397
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,220
wreck from those things now I just

398
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,350
notice that I come back with no voice

399
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,800
because I smoke way too much I take too

400
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,659
many dads and I talk too damn much is my

401
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,009

403

00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,629
people that's part of our to what we

448
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,649
want to do it's part of the job it's

449
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:02,750
part of the goal it's part of the

450
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,189
mission is to go meet our friends like I

451
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,990
said without you guys we're just a bunch

452
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,400
of weirdos we're a family we're trying

453
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,379
to make a family that's what we do there

454
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,149
it goes on to say so it was a really

455
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,230
cool experience for us and it couldn't

456
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,459
have been what we couldn't have been

457
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,509
more impressed with the Colorado

458
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,040
cannabis community you

459
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:18,720
by a thousand miles to attend these

460
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,569
events and check out the local scene and

461
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,460
you never know what to expect that is

462
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,040
very true you spend a ton of money you

463
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,660
get a flight you get a hotel you get an

464
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,159
uber to the hotel then you got to make

465
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,839
it to the event and then when you get

466
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,279
there you don't know if the people are

467
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,810
going to be friendly if they're gonna be

468
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,699
total dicks if they act like rock stars

469
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,459
you don't know if the event is going to

470
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,450
be a flop it's a really big gamble when

471
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,639
you don't know what you're getting into

472
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,890
luckily the Indo Expo is done very well

473
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,019

474

00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,620
never have felt more welcomed not just

485
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,779
by the people at the expo but by

486
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,480
everyone we encountered in the cannabis

487
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,819
community in Colorado that's beautiful

488
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,950
to hear I'm glad my crew my state my

489
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,730
people did a good job and made you feel

490
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,860
welcome

491
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,659
I'm glad the embracing organics crew was

492
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,430
kind to you I wish I could have taken a

493
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,360
DAB with you in the dab bus but that's

494
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,609
just how it goes

495
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,649
ahh next time next time I'll make

496
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,149
somebody else work the booth while I go

497
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,470
take some dabs but everybody wants to

498
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,909
find me at the booth so it's kind of I

499
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,460
feel like I should be there I'm sure you

500
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:37,589
understand this message does continue it

501
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,840
says it was my fiance's first time and

502
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,300

503
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,490
boss is going to let me off so we can go

504
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:47,039

thank you for the continued

536
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:54,009
correspondence I think this is the

537
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,170
second or third message I've read from

538
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:57,730
you on the show big thanks for all of

539
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,230
the support you guys I got a press pause

540
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,120
and take a drink my voice is doing that

541
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,319
thing so I'll be right back after I get

542
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,509
some hydration going on

543
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,250
take a DAB while I'm gone I'll rat out

544
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:08,289
rat I'll rat I'm back guess what I hit

545
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,640
some of that orange skittles live batter

546
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:15,879
from apothecary farms the THC is 66.7%

547
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,590
THC total cannabinoids is seventy seven

548
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,419
point two percent I'm cracking it open

549
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:22,709
to give you guys an accurate smell

550
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:25,360
description as soon as I open it it's

551
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,160
funky oranges I can't describe it better

552
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,349
than funky oranges it's orange

553
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,400
but there's something nasty to it that I

554
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,678
really enjoy

555
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,440
orange skittles you guys skittles with a

556
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,720
Z so they don't get in any trouble live

557
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,700
better from apothecary farms I'm diggin

558
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,980
it the first thing I noticed is it made

559
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,169
my eyes nice and heavy I got those heavy

560
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,179
eyeballs now so big shout-out to our

561
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,669
friends at apothecary farms forget me

562
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,169
nicely stoned here on a podcast art I've

563
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,419
got one more email that I'm gonna read

564
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,720
this one comes from our friend who calls

565
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,690
themselves David W from STL but upshots

566
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,730
my friends in the STL the message goes a

567
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,230
lot just alike at this it says you'll

568
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,630
Rasta Jeff thank you for all of the

569
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,919
knowledge you drop on us every week you

570
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,320
were doing great things for the

571
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,150
community and the movement thank you bro

572
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,950
that means a lot to me I appreciate the

573
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,630
words of encouragement I'm out here

574
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,880
trying to do what I can man just doing

575
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,919
my part so thank you for the motivation

576
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,350
and for acknowledging my work I do

577
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,809
appreciate it it goes on to say here is

578
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:25,359
my question to suppose it feminized

579
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:27,759
seeds I got from the dude I know ended

580
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,308
up being Otto flowers they are in my

581
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,779
garden along with a few other photo

582
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:33,940
period rags

583
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,668
since the autos have started flowering

584
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,700
what effect would it have on them if I

585
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:42,009
were to switch to a 1212 light cycle for

586
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,090
the photo period regulars to start

587
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,309
flowering

588
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:48,609
thanks again from your friend David Debu

589
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,960
from the STL he says you can use my name

590
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,699
thank you that makes things so much

591
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,559
easier when you give me permission to

592
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,230
use your name alright let's talk about

593
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,460
this our new friend David was growing

594
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,500
some seeds which he thought were

595
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,870
feminized they are probably feminized

596
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,400
but it turns out that they are OTO

597
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,750
flowers and I'm assuming you think

598
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,090
they're OTO flowers because they have

599
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,509
probably Auto flowered while you've got

600
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,829
them under a veg light situation that

601
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,410
may have been caused because they were

602
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,389
root bound but it is probably accurate

603
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,790
that they are OTO flowers now the main

604
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,410
question is he has got some other plants

605
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,599
in there that he wants to put into the

606
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,759
flower cycle but they are photo period

607
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,879
regular seeds so they are going to

608
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:31,150
require a 1212 light cycle the auto

609
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,060
flowering plants will do best under a 16

610
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,220
8 or 18 6 light cycle I'm not an auto

611
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,769
flower guy I don't breed or grow OTO

612
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,500
flowers so that time period may be off

613
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:44,379
but they do better with a longer photo

614
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,740
period of daylight hours because they're

615
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,110
bred to flower without a reduced light

616
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,539
period now what is going to happen if we

617
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:54,579
reduce the lights to twelve twelve to

618
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,829
trigger our photo period seeds into

619
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:59,740
flower the main thing you will notice is

620
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:01,659
that those OTO flowers may slow down in

621
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,870
growth a little bit because they are not

622
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,400
getting as much light energy as they

623
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:08,829
would prefer they've been used to

624
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
getting 18 or 16 hours worth of light

625
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:11,619
all day every day

626
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,779
and now you've cut that down they're

627
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:15,250
gonna go hey I thought we were gonna get

628
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,720
more light than that bro so they're

629
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,299
gonna act like they're not going to grow

630
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,220
as rapidly and as vigorously they may

631
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:23,859
take a little bit longer to finish also

632
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,329
they may take a little bit shorter to

633
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,219
finish I'm not sure how they're going to

634
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:29,139
respond to this but you won't get as

635
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,200
much growth as you would have because

636
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,690
the white the Sun is the most effective

637
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,250
most desired nutrient for a plant it is

638
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,809
the most important building block for

639
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,460
big buds but we have to do the

640
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,589
compromise we have to reduce the light

641
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,299
cycle enough to encourage the plants to

642
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:45,129
flower so they think that the season is

643
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,440
ending but we also have to give them

644
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,360
enough light to create big fat buds so

645
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,039
you can easily switch your lights to

646
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,899
twelve twelve those Auto flowers will

647
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,149
continue to flower you're just not going

648
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,830
to see the productivity that you would

649
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,070
hope to see from those

650
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,819
plants so my overall advice is to don't

651
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,589
be scared

652
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,928
put those plants on 1212 get those

653
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,939
photoperiod plants go in and then just

654
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,288
move forward and get those autos out of

655
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,610
there that's an experience that's

656
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:11,288
something that happened they're not

657
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:13,089
going to be the most amazing plants but

658
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,129
you will get something out of them just

659
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:17,230
let them finish you may want to reduce

660
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,090
the feed they may not eat as much

661
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,250
nutrients because they're not getting as

662
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,139
much light they can't metabolize and

663
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,028
photosynthesize as much so they're not

664
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,429
going to be as active they may not even

665
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:29,528
drink as much for a little while so pay

666
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,778
attention to the plants how they respond

667
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,769
and how they react I think everything

668
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:34,450
will be okay

669
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,190
you're just not going to get as much

670
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,080
productivity pay attention to the

671
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,460
feeding pay attention to the frequency

672
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,798
and the strength of your feeding

673
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,659
solution and I think you will be just

674
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,869
