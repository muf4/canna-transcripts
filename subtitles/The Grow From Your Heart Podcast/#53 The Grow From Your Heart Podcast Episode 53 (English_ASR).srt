you guys for coming these guys showed up

165
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,560
early dude three paw heads showed up to

166
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,800
my house early I was impressed yeah it

167
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,399
worked out really well yeah pulled up at

168
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,280
the same time 5 seconds after ni nice

169
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,839
punctual Stoners so um this will be a

170
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,879
perfect question since you guys are from

171
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,560
the organic side of the growing uh I've

172
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,319
been talking about grow Kashi I actually

173
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,959
gave some grok Kashi away in a Prize

174
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,400
Package recently and one of my listeners

175
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,638
a lot of the listeners have been asking

176
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,478
how to use the grok Kashi um I read the

177
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,918
instructions and it says to fill up your

178
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:44,560
Reservoir with however many gallons of

179
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,198
water and then you add a third of a cup

180
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
of kosi and then you mix in I don't

181
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,639
remember the specific amount of molasses

182
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,638
but you mix in a specific amount of

183
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,639
molasses per gallon and then you let it

184
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,800
sit for 24 to 48 hours and then that I

185
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,918
use that excuse my cough guys we took

186
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,400
some gnarly dabs uh after after that's

187
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,159
mixed I use that and just water into the

188
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,279
top of my plants and I noticed that they

189
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,439
love it U do you guys have other ways

190
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,279
that you prefer or recommend do you guys

191
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,680
want to take that there's a ton of other

192
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,959
ways you can put it in your soil he guys

193
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,720
this is Allan on the mic just so that

194
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,318
you know who you're listening to you can

195
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,800
put it in your te's um top dress you

196
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,720
know you can get your mycelium going on

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,280
the top layer with that sometimes you

198
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,639
want to you know put a mulch down you

199
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,478
don't want to get too dry so you got to

200
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,319
watch out with that but definitely have

201
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,959
seen results layering it in your pock

202
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,439
as you you transplant okay so some dirt

203
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,359
then some Kashi then some dirt then

204
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,360
somei you know whatever you're doing

205
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,439
whatever you're uh your organic heart

206
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,038
desires and since you're in there

207
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,680
throwing some worm castings right worm

208
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,318
castings everywhere every time

209
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
everywhere I've seen you know I've seen

210
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,560
a difference in my plants I've only been

211
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,199
using them for a week and my plants uh

212
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
they're more vigorous they're wanting to

213
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,160
more they're wanting more water more

214
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,478
often because they're growing so much

215
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,919
more it's because they're learning how

216
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,719
to eat by

217
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,038
themselves they're starting to cycle

218
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,479
nutrients uh basically what you're doing

219
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,598
is when you're growing synthetically

220
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:07,240
you're just bypassing this entire

221
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,159
organic life yeah I mean you you're just

222
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,439
cutting everything out so we're just

223
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,800
shooting it up feeding it ex taking a

224
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,279
shortcut through the rizosphere okay

225
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,240
exactly that's you know that's actually

226
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,198
why uh hydrog Growers have to supplement

227
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,000
with so much CO2 there's no CO2 produced

228
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,319
in the decomposition of theposition of

229
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,439
the natural soil I don't have the number

230
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
in front of me but I've been doing some

231
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,079
research lately but uh yeah there's

232
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
actually a significant amount of CO2 put

233
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,878
off running like a no till system larger

234
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,439
containers lot importantance

235
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,160
decomposition you know you can't uh we

236
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,319
we're taught science but it's not

237
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,759
science it's all nature it's been done

238
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,639
for thousands of years you know Koreans

239
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,840
and and that goes back to the tribes

240
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,199
yeah Bashi has been around forever it's

241
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,119
nothing new you know it's not what's the

242
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,960
difference between Bashi and gashi I'm

243
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,759
good on that joint here I'll take a hit

244
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,878
because you look to me like I'm a puss I

245
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,560
just don't need the cotton mouth on the

246
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,319
show here so it's it's kind of like a

247
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,280
it's like a b you know like the Band-Aid

248
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,520
brand the grok kashi's kind of taken

249
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,799
over the industry like that so grok

250
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,198
Kashi is

251
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,439
Bashi uh they are the same thing it's

252
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:19,038
just gashi makes their own mix of buk

253
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,519
Kashi and Bashi is nothing but a uhand

254
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,158
yeah basically it's a brand or it can be

255
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,918
any medium you can use sticks or stems

256
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,800
or oand just any sort of carbon based uh

257
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,359
material then you're going to inoculate

258
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,560
it with typically yeast photosynthetic

259
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,000
bacteria and a lactic acid bacteria so

260
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,598
that's an EM1 if you if you're familiar

261
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,759
follow our feeds and stuff important

262
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,839
probiotic Farmers Alliance if I'm not

263
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:46,879
mistaken uh gashi actually adds in

264
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,800
glacial Rock Dust for trace minerals so

265
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,919
that's kind of what makes up their mix

266
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,439
uh okay Rocky Mount worm company will

267
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,240
actually start carrying their own bhashi

268
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,959
here you can add a lot to your bhashi

269
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,680
and ours will actually be inoculated

270
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,039
with humic acids some local iOS so some

271
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,159
Yeah so basically you get a little piece

272
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,719
of our Gardens in yours it'll be pretty

273
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,600
neat little bit spread around yeah we

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,480
want to try to keep it local you know

275
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,278
Rocky Mountain Natural Farm is trying to

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
keep everything in Colorado you know

277
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,439
bring back to the community it's really

278
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,278
cool yeah cuz it's important especially

279
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
in the Cannabis Community to you know

280
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,679
give back to others and you see it a lot

281
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,120
in other states that have been doing it

282
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,799
a little longer you know their Community

283
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,799
is a little bit more uh integrated you

284
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,599
know up in NorCal a lot of people that's

285
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,919
how farming

286
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
exactly it's a specialized product but

287
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,799
it's definitely it's an artisan product

288
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,839
you know um it goes with anything with

289
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,919
wine cheese meats you know it's just you

290
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,320
should have instruments yeah you know

291
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,159
computers cars you should want the best

292
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,040
and you know with Organic uh practices

293
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,319
that's what you get an actual medicine

294
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,240
that's uh pure you know you're not

295
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
smoking anything that shouldn't be in

296
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,879
your body and that map and dap yeah you

297
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,879
know just gave me the yeah get away from

298
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,720
the map and D that makes me want to get

299
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,360
back to the how to use the groc Kashi

300
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,800
though I don't I don't want to leave

301
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,079
them without some sort of I was

302
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,639
definitely going to come back around I

303
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:14,159
definitely try to do that yeah so

304
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,799
basically for me personally if you just

305
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,799
want me to tell you how I use G let's

306
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,679
hear it cuz you're great at this field

307
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,679
well thank you um so basically when I do

308
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,000
my initial transplant out of a red Solo

309
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,838
cup uh I'll the soil mixed traditionally

310
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,039
cuz I make my own soils we'll have gashi

311
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,079
in it already

312
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,039
or my own form of fukashi or gashi so

313
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,919
we'll it'll have it in the soil mix but

314
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,838
I always top dress every time I

315
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,278
transplant always top dress and usually

316
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,160
it's with a cover crop a a little bit of

317
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,000
grashy little bit of worm castings and

318
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,519
then I'll just water it in with a

319
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
product we carry that's called CA crop I

320
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,278
heard a lot about that it's it's amazing

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,600
it's basically uh it's kind of like

322
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,039
fermented seawat if I had to yeah is

323
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,159
that your uh your fish uh no it's not a

324
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,838
fish tion I would say I use this in

325
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,240
place traditionally if you're familiar

326
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,200
with full power okay I I kind of use it

327
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,120
in the place of that it's got a lot of

328
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,040
fulvic acids a lot of trace minerals a

329
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,639
lot of things that you're not going to

330
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,278
get you know from your basic what you

331
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,560
see a lot of coastal Growers we we don't

332
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,879
we don't have a a micronutrient bottle

333
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,638
to use so we use C crop but yeah so I

334
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,000
usually water in with the c crop right

335
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,399
after that and then we'll roll into

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,759
uh basically after that it'll be every

337
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
two weeks

338
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,799
I'll go through and do a gashi dreg

339
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
which is basically what you're referring

340
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,958
to okay uh I do mine a little bit

341
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,360
differently so what I like to do is use

342
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:47,559
a grinded herb traditionally like

343
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,240
a dragonfly Earth medicine um so I use a

344
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:54,199
take basically if I'm doing a 10 gallon

345
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,519
thing of tea or groc Kashi Dr so I'll

346
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,320
take uh my dragonfly Earth medicine I'll

347
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,399
mix it in there depending on you know

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,120
flour veg radiant green or flat flour

349
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,879
dump that in there if you don't have

350
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
those you can use alal for kelp okay uh

351
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,799
you know so I dump that in there usually

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,320
at whatever recommended rate you're

353
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:15,519
going to run a tea with then I add in a

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,839
four a cup of you know Bashi per gallon

355
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,278
uh four a cup of worm castings per

356
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,079
gallon and then one teaspoon

357
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:27,000
of depending on what stage I'll either

358
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:30,000
use molasses or yucka just some sort of

359
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,600
carbohydrate Source yeah and then I seal

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,958
it up and then forget about it uh they

361
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,959
say like 12 to 24 hours but in my

362
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,198
personal experience nothing's wrong with

363
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,879
taking to 14 days wow ferment you're

364
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,359
fermenting so yeah as long as you want

365
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,078
it to go a little longer rule a thumb if

366
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,919
it smells bad it is bad um okay and

367
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:52,000
you're if you're familiar

368
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,919
with probiotics Kimi things like that so

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,519
you'll you'll start to learn what good

370
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,399
ferments are what bad ferments are so

371
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,440
put that almost Sweet Bitter and not

372
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,198
funky exactly exactly kindar yeah once

373
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,560
the uh once the fish smell overpowers

374
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,240
then it's Funk right and you're gone

375
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,239
exact okay exactly makes sense when you

376
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,799
can tolerate it and then as far as do

377
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,198
you want to seal it up also you said

378
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,240
yeah what I usually do is uh everybody's

379
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,240
probably got a bunch of panda film Ling

380
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,120
around somewhere so what I usually do is

381
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,600
cut a big square or have a big Square

382
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,480
Panda film that was left over from like

383
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,879
a floor door or something I made and I

384
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,240
just lay it over the container and wrap

385
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,639
it in string and tie it tight there you

386
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,959
go uh that's it I mean it's oranic is

387
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,919
not fancy yeah you know this is this is

388
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,359
all in my you know basement at the home

389
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,000
it doesn't this would have happened by

390
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,519
Nature running down a hill into a big

391
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,879
shitty puddle exactly yeah it's not

392
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,480
fancy yeah so and the idea is that we're

393
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,559
going to try to balance out uh aerobic

394
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,360
and Anor robic bacteria uh in nature

395
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,919
both exist like you for the exact reason

396
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,759
you were saying things fall on the

397
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,719
ground they Decay uh you have puddles of

398
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,680
stagnant water animals dying hot spots

399
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,440
in the ground

400
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,958
so by introducing these things on a

401
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
regular basis I I've you know I feel

402
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,198
that that's where we're kind of getting

403
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
a biological

404
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,039
Edge I see a difference in my plants and

405
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
I know it's only been a couple of weeks

406
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,319
but just feeding them they're more

407
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,039
vigorous they are ready to grow it's

408
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,680
basically yeah the so you've got your

409
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,799
your protozoa cycle nutrients your

410
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,278
fungal hyha the bacteria content there's

411
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,240
nematodes in there so you're just

412
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,439
getting this tur I mean it's funny

413
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
because you know you go to the hydro

414
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
store and you see that they sell neemat

415
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,278
and you see that they sell great white

416
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,198
and you see that they sell OG T and they

417
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,000
sell all of these things and it's like

418
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,000
if you take some time to go to Rocky

419
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,360
Mount worm company's website you can

420
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,120
actually look it up and you'll see that

421
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,959
all of these things are already in your

422
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,639
worm castings and you can make your own

423
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,958
uh you take five small scoops of worm

424
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,799
castings and a 5 gallon bucket of water

425
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,958
of good clean water reverse osmosis

426
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,559
clean decoronated water and bubble that

427
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,239
[ __ ] for like 12 hours and you've just

428
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,399
made great white you've made all of

429
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,720
those products on the Shelf exactly will

430
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,759
say that if you're new to making teas or

431
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,759
even if you're familiar with making teas

432
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,159
with uh worm castings a lot of people

433
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,480
you we use like Alaskan humus from

434
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,360
General Organics different things like

435
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,759
that traditionally they're using one cup

436
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,199
per gallon please don't waste your like

437
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,600
you're just going to be wasting money

438
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,000
and you're going to be creating a mess

439
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
are very powerful worm a fourth of cup

440
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,320
per gallon all you're going to need with

441
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,120
Jay's nice I'm going to write that down

442
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,440
cuz I don't I think I used more to tell

443
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,078
you the truth I have it written down in

444
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,759
the honestly that's one I I would even

445
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,758
go one cup per five gallon bucket okay

446
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,879
yeah just to keep it real simple nice

447
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,519
but yeah that's you're going to get

448
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,000
every and you got to leave some room for

449
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,159
foam you guys leave room for foamz

450
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,318
that's just going to foam up and if you

451
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,639
if you do have a problem with the foam

452
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,838
you can always add in some sort of like

453
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,480
uh fat lipid so you could use like a

454
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,800
fish Hydra slle take it out neem oil

455
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,720
Kaja oil coconut oil if I put neem oil

456
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:58,318
in there how much would I use uh

457
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,120
honestly to take away foam you would

458
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,599
just kind of like drip it off your

459
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,839
finger out of the bottle and it'll just

460
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,440
kind of go away yeah I would recommend

461
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,639
more or less just throw in a plants love

462
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,120
coconuts I mean seriously coconut water

463
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
coconut powder if you can get it if you

464
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
eat them and you you know buy them at

465
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,000
the supermarket go ahead and grab an

466
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,799
extra one and throw it in every so often

467
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,799
but yeah I would throw a te like if your

468
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,278
stuff's foaming up too bad throw a

469
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,078
little bit of coconut oil in there your

470
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,240
plants will like it foam will go away

471
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,879
keep your floor nice and clean if not

472
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
buy a drip tray twice the size of your

473
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,639
Brewer

474
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,639
or Brew it in like a rubber M container

475
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,480
Organics can get hands on and a little

476
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,120
messy but fun part I used to when I

477
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
started uh I've been through every

478
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,720
nutrient line I miss back in the day

479
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
mixing 42 bottles of advanced nutrients

480
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
like it used to be fun I felt like the

481
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,639
mad scientist looking for the perfect

482
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,800
mix and now I can do it with my Organics

483
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,519
with the help of you guys that's how I

484
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,439
first started growing was with bottles

485
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,198
and you know my first grow I I'll admit

486
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,600
it I mess those plants up I feel so bad

487
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,439
and I wish I had went with Organics but

488
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,759
I was nervous but now after actually you

489
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,120
know practicing it and going Hands-On

490
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,759
and just kind of diving in and after

491
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,438
reading a lot of the books you know they

492
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,959
help but you get to the end of them and

493
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,480
it's like this is just life and just

494
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,519
what you know has been happening and

495
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,519
it's what you've learned in in science

496
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,480
class it's nothing new it's just you

497
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,279
know going a little farther Beyond and

498
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,318
that's where like the Korean farming

499
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,038
comes into and you know that that's a

500
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,599
little bit more Hands-On but once you

501
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,798
you know start somewhere small with worm

502
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,678
cast things you know that's a big step

503
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,400
in your gardening practice if you're

504
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,600
trying to get hardcore into it you want

505
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,200
to be completely self-sufficient and we

506
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,918
can help you do that I mean I'm serious

507
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
we can help you to where you you'll

508
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,160
never have to go to the hydroid store

509
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,919
you'll never have to come to J you'll

510
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,679
never have to rely on anybody to grow

511
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,400
your own plants but in order to do that

512
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
you're going to have to start somewhere

513
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,120
right and that's somewhere that's the

514
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
hard part is worm castings you know once

515
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,399
I've jumped in exactly and once you

516
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
start with that base and then you'll

517
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,919
start to understand you know okay this

518
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,038
is why I'm mixing it in with the soil

519
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,600
this is what they're doing uh a lot of

520
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,000
stuff starts to make sense so you're

521
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,599
going to see the root growth on your

522
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,319
plants after you transplant how

523
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,158
beautiful everything looks root bags for

524
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,119
this run and they're coming out of the

525
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,520
bottoms vigorously and usually those

526
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,839
roots that fall out of the holes like

527
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,119
that they die off but they're still

528
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,678
reaching they're crawling around the

529
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,759
room on the floor like I could find

530
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
somewhere I'm sure like they're stoked

531
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,440
about life in there yeah little Shah

532
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,400
haras that's it yeah yep I got huge

533
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,240
Roots now awesome a bad thing and

534
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,440
they're white they're super duper white

535
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,679
glad to hear that yeah nice and fuzzy

536
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,640
just a little Cy and a two applications

537
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,360
of worm castings is really all it is and

538
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,480
don't be afraid to use the worm castings

539
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,439
in the soil mixes and you know when

540
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,279
you're transplant 10% is what I

541
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,360
typically go with for my personal I

542
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,759
don't know what how long how long does

543
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,519
it take for those worm castings to

544
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:56,679
become VI bioavailable to my plants uh I

545
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,918
would say theoretically

546
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,679
instantaneously yeah so you're not

547
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,520
there's no NPK or so there is a t there

548
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,000
is BAS an mpk value but that's not why

549
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,200
you're using

550
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,159
themc so when you're adding them the

551
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,720
reason that you're going to get uh I'm

552
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,720
not going to say instant results but

553
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,759
results so quick is because when you

554
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,319
introduce those you're not like it's not

555
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,200
like a fertilizer that you're waiting to

556
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,678
be absorbed by the RO exactly it's life

557
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,640
you just dropped a spaceship in that

558
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,080
soil there little worms in these worm

559
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,880
castings you guys there are little tiny

560
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,720
baby worms in the package you may get

561
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
some worms in your casting that tell

562
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,400
tell you that that that tells me that

563
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,038
that [ __ ] is alive if that worm was

564
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,759
alive in there it got shipped they were

565
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,558
packaged in Colorado Springs as far as I

566
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:40,038
know I bought it in Pueblo at hyro um I

567
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,399
had it in my in my car for a day before

568
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,960
I even was able to bring it in the house

569
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,360
cuz you can't haul in all the grow [ __ ]

570
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,759
during the day you know you got to kind

571
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,079
of I will say though uh when purchasing

572
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,599
worm castings the first thing you want

573
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,798
to do is seal them you want to put them

574
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:55,639
in a sealed container cuz they will dry

575
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,720
out and that's one of the wor you'll

576
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,240
waste a lot of money doing that cuz once

577
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,919
dry out then they're no better than

578
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,558
anything office store sh they're just

579
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,440
that packaged stuff at the store it's

580
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,319
all dusty and can see no one's bought it

581
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,840
and now someone came in I like playing

582
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,839
it you smell it I said that on the last

583
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,519
episode I said they smell so good eat

584
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,918
them and I don't think I would but uh it

585
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,119
I said it smells delicious and I said

586
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,720
that people were going to make think I'm

587
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,399
weird because I said it smells good but

588
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,038
I love that that's part of why I grow

589
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,240
dirt still is cuz I love the smell of

590
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,200
good dirt I'm just a they smell great he

591
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,679
at I'm from the east coast and when I

592
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,279
came to Colorado it like hurt my soul to

593
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,400
not see dirt you know just the it's just

594
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,879
yeah East Coast we have lomy soils yeah

595
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,720
okay I was going to say there's a lot of

596
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,320
dirt here bro we got Mountain coal nice

597
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,319
Coastal lomy soil um a lot of

598
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,359
decomposition trees all that water

599
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:55,038
and a lot of deciduous forests that uh

600

die off and dust yeah P clayo dust clay

601
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry I don't get out of I haven't

when you could get up without making

635
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:08,679
sound effects every time I walk up the

00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,240
just come out if it doesn't after a

646
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,879
minute I'll put you back on you can uh

647
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,200
if since you're going to be recycling

648
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,520
soil in Organics and you're going to

649
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,960
want to stay sustainable you can um put

650
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,359
it in your soil bins when you're

651
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,720
recycling your soil to help break down

652
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,319
uh organic matter in there such as

653
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,319
leaves and stocks hold dead Roots y root

654
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:48,839
balls everything put it in there put a

655
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,079
top layer mix it in while you're

656
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,879
covering it and you know the mul is my

657
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,678
next step uh the mulch to contri mixing

658
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,760
bukachi into your soil traditionally

659
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,278
it's a 2% by volume okay so two gallons

660
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,158
for 200 gallons okay yeah that goes a

661
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:06,839
long way so you yeah I mean you're going

662
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,679
to have to build like uh a trough or

663
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,158
something or buy a res or something to

664
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,679
mix up your soil in you need something a

665
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,919
tarp on the ground works but it's low

666
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,278
down and it's hard to work Kitty pools

667
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
are KY pools are awesome there you go

668
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,919
it's a good idea and then buckets and

669
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,480
then store it buckets rubber made

670
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,880
containers work really well big ass

671
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,480
trash can 27 G when you guys see that

672
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,919
white stuff growing on your soil don't

673
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,079
freak out that's good that's what you're

674
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,400
aiming for I've seen people open it up

675
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,199
and see that white growth and throw

676
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,360
their [ __ ] away don't do that so mix

677
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,400
your soil grab some gashi you know mix

678
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,959
that so if you're going to remend your

679
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
soil make your groc kashian put your

680
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,000
amendments in there like you were saying

681
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,120
mix it up in a you know Kitty Pooler on

682
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,759
a tarp put them up in a rubber made

683
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,038
container biodiverse and then what I

684
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,798
would recommend doing is swinging by uh

685
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:54,640
JS and picking up either cocoons or if

686
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,839
you really want to like it's it's a lot

687
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,080
of fun but live worms and uh throw them

688
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,079
in there okay and just let them go to

689
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:05,079
town because either they're gonna die or

690
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,759
they're going to survive uh they self-

691
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,278
poop populate so they'll either get in

692
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,640
there they'll do well if your soil is

693
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,640
optimal and is running how it should

694
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,080
your worms will uh reproduce and you

695
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,320
will have you know an active soil food

696
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,439
web and they do help but uh I know

697
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,798
Sean's had experience with them kind of

698
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,960
over fting the plant with breaking down

699
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,879
yeah they find hot spots so if you mix

700
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,278
your so let's say that you mix your soil

701
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,840
and you're like dang I don't know if I

702
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,480
did that good enough didn't stir that

703
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,639
one spot right there throw some worms in

704
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,839
there and they tend to like they find

705
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,120
hot spots and they'll work their way

706
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,558
through it and they tend to break it up

707
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,479
but yeah actually I was running uh I

708
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,639
went into one of my rooms and saw some

709
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,960
test plants with a little bit of

710
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,159
nitrogen toxicity you know so the tips

711
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
of the leaves were kind of pointing at

712
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,000
the ground and they were a little dark

713
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,480
green I was like this is weird I don't

714
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,880
feed them anything how is this happening

715
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,880
what did I do um so is actually alfalfa

716
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,720
hay that I mulch or that I used to mulch

717
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,919
with um but the worms went crazy in it

718
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,798
started just eating the [ __ ] out of it

719
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:11,880
and I guess they cycled it and it burnt

720
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,480
my plant or it didn't burn my plant but

721
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,080
it it was taking up a lot of it yeah I

722
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,679
mean it was it was pretty amazing so it

723
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,240
really kind of so you can kind of overdo

724
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
it with Organics as well yeah I mean you

725
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,759
don't yeah you really want to be less is

726
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,959
more with Organics you got to know what

727
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,798
breaks down in what fashion and how long

728
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,360
it takes to break down and you know

729
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,558
knowing your plant don't don't run one

730
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,240
plant one cycle in Organics and give up

731
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,038
because you you want to dial that in and

732
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,038
it's it might take one or two runs but

733
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,599
that's the beginning you know you got

734
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,359
yeah you got to start somewhere and then

735
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,199
whatever your best friend told you to

736
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,278
mix your soil at do it at half that rate

737
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,440
because it's way easier to fix the

738
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,159
deficiency than is to flush out some

739
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,440
sort of something that you put in there

740
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,278
way too high Bro Science does not work

741
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,399
all the time so do you carry any sort of

742
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,880
dehydrated coconut water yes uh well I

743
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,239
don't want to say yes so we've been

744
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,440
working really hard um we're kind of

745
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,960
revamping inventory we're carrying uh

746
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,640
soon we'll be uh cover crops will be

747
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,558
available all amendments will be

748
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,360
available inoculant herbal inoculant

749
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,158
yeah we'll have herbal inoculant so not

750
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,278
just we'll be able to offer things like

751
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,200
alala meal crusta meal oyster shell

752
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,359
powder kelp meal it's all food grade

753
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,159
it's all organic but we'll also be

754
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,759
carrying uh aloe vera powder freeze Red

755
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,440
Coconut powder this is all organic

756
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,519
processed uh you know it's of the

757
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,120
highest quality we'll also be starting

758
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,960
to carry uh I don't I don't know if we

759
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,959
can grinded herbs can we start saying

760
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,600
that can we say that we're going to

761
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,558
start powderized herbs Rocky Mountain

762
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,000
worm company in the next few months is

763
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:49,119
definitely going to be um changing a

764
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,798
face uh nothing is set in stone yet so I

765
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,319
won't say anything definite but uh the

766
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,599
community is definitely going to have a

767
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,599
lot more things available to them for

768
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,240
their organic needs so uh just keep an

769
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,199
eye out follow our Instagram rock some

770
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,359
sort of like a feed chart or something

771
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
to go with all the goodies you're

772
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,000
offering is that available yet not yet

773
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,840
uh so basically we're trying to work out

774
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,278
inventory first before we tell you uh

775
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,480
okay what to use and not have it for you

776
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,960
to use that's a good idea so yeah we're

777
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,599
really working on inventory right now

778
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,519
we're we've worked it out a couple of

779
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,480
times a couple of the products that we

780
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,599
were had on our Ro we calling it The

781
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,880
Rocky Mount natural farming schedule a

782
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,240
couple of things we had on there

783
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,760
initially are a little harder to source

784
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,919
and I don't think that we'll be able to

785
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,919
keep the regiment up if people actually

786
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,080
pick it on so we're trying to make sure

787
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,679
that if that occasion does happen like I

788
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:43,879
was saying I mean I guess we can say he

789
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,880
already bought the damn grinder so we're

790
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,240
going to start powderize our own herbs

791
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,278
even if we don't start selling them

792
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,440
we'll start be doing we're going to

793
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:53,398
start doing experiments of powderize our

794
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,320
own Yaro and alala and stuff but we will

795
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,959
have uh I would say April is going to be

796
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,200
is the big kickoff

797
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,000
we'll be at the Cannabis Cup in some

798
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,640

801
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,038
trust me I'll I'll have some type of hat

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,440
on if I don't have my beo hat on and

803
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:17,240

804
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,440
yeah they'll be getting a booth so uh

we'll get you a Bashi bucket we'll start

1020
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,240
you that's what I mean I get an anerobic

1021
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,079
compost so we can start recycling all of

1022
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:43,118
your kitchen scrap uh and then as far as

1023
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,760
your plant waste navigate The Maze

1024
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,920
different materials like that we can

1025
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,520
also show you how to recycle those

1026
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,318
basically what you're going to want what

1027
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,159
I would recommend doing would be so you

1028
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:57,279
want to start a compost bin uh take a

1029

leftover pot from last season start out

1030
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,920
with a nice soil base okay just dump it

1031
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,000
in there and then just feel free to

1032
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,720
start adding stuff you know throw stuff

1033
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,358
in there I keep a bucket in my like a

1034
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,078
five gallon bucket in my back door and

1035
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:13,000
then I'll just throw things into it and

1036
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,920
then every couple of days I'll walk that

1037
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,599
out to the actual compost pile in my

1038
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,519

they'll pay you to come and get the hell

1077
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,519
out of their yard right come clean how I

1078
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,599
got all of my Alfalfa hey it was the guy

1079
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,759
had to scrape his horse pins you know I

1080
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,800
know if you're familiar with horses but

1081
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,200
they scraped the pins and I went and

1082
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,119
collected that so I got a lot of the

1083
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,598
Alfalfa that I ran in my last grow nice

1084
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,559
so it got repurposed it didn't get

1085
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,760
thrown in a landfill and it got to grow

1086
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,559
some it was wasted yeah last grow I was

1087
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,880
I was really like motivated to make all

1088
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:20,920
of my own nutrients um really motivated

1089
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,200
so I learned how to kind of source it

1090
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,920
from everywhere so does that mean that

1091
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,519
you you've kind of murdered yourself

1092
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,159
trying to be so motivated did you slow

1093
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,480
yourself down that means that basic I

1094
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,519
all I had to pay for last girl was power

1095
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,679
I didn't have any other money you know

1096
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:37,599
so it was it was you know Organics keeps

1097
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,919
your pocket yeah the past you know I'm

1098
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,599
not going to lie the past like half a

1099
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,599
year has been a little rough and I

1100
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,240
didn't have all the money to really do

1101
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,119
what we wanted to so it was let's buy

1102
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,279
fruits let's take the cores and the

1103
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,039
skins and the pits and let's fermented

1104
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,079
plant make a plant juice out of it and

1105
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,800
it's oh I can grow micro greens and peas

1106
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,400
and sprouts and I can eat them in my

1107
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,480
sandwiches but I can also ferment them

1108
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,639
use them as a tea additive or a foiler

1109
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,760
spray the same thing with my eggs like

1110
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,039
I'm buying eggs from the store I'm Gonna

1111
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,560
Save My eggshells because I can use that

1112
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,719
with apple cider vinegar which I'm

1113
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,239
already buying because I my health you

1114
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:16,118
know I drink it for health reasons wash

1115
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,639
my Dr with it yeah so you just mix that

1116
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,039
so you brown eggshell crush them up

1117
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,838
brown some eggshells mix it with apple

1118
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,719

1119
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:28,239
you can make everything in your grow

1120
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,559
with nothing I've done it it's easy just

1121
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,759
got to learn where it comes from what it

1122
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,400
is learn where nature would have

1123
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,400
provided it Go by the Oriental F if

1124
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,440
you're hungry and you need so if you and

1125
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,280
your plants are hungry in the same uh at

1126
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,599
the same time what I recommend doing is

1127
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,480
cruising on down to your local Asian

1128
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,039
market and grabbing you some black fish

1129
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,159
the darker the better I I don't know the

1130
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,719
exact reason um but I would just go with

1131
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,879
it uh so yeah you going and get you

1132
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,838
that's what Dr CH said I mean you gota

1133
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,559
you just got to go with he's the kind of

1134
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:57,599
the founder natural farming okay but uh

1135
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,279
yeah so you can take some so yeah

1136
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,200
literally go and buy you some fish clean

1137
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,319
it eat what you want whatever's left

1138
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,039
over blend it you know typically with

1139
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,719
like a brown sugar blend it all up

1140
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:16,639
together that's important and then seal

1141
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:18,679
it and 30 days strain it add uh IMO

1142
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,440
which or you could which is indigenous

1143
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,399
microorganisms or EM1 or lactic acid

1144
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,119
bacteria any of those will really work

1145
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,440
in that situation and that's the one

1146
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,680
thing about organic gardening and sourc

1147
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,200
ing things locally uh it's going to help

1148
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,519
your plant fight off a lot of different

1149
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,960
diseases pests that are found in your

1150
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:39,239
region especially if you're growing

1151
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,119
outside uh use a lot of different imos

1152
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:45,078
um it's it's just indigenous

1153
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,318
microorganisms yeah we will be having a

1154
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,960
maybe we'll get into that a little B

1155
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,679
more in another episode we will be

1156
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,318
having a class uh or I don't want to say

1157
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,639

yeah I've actually talked to Jesse about

1178
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,879
the potential of us teaming up and maybe

doing some classes together uh he's get

1180

hands on with everybody Jeff is so good

1181
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,719
at just articulating what needs to be

1182
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,720
done to like basic just I mean really

1183
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,838
anybody he can tell anybody how to grow

1184
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,399
I was hoping he was going to be here

1185
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,719
tonight yeah but I know they're doing

1186
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,680
some like really cool classes I think

1187
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,959
they did like cloning last time and some

1188
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,960
really like awesome introduction classes

1189
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,559
so I'm hoping we can kind of team up and

1190
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,358
maybe you know do some more advanced

1191
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,480
classes for the start off easy and then

1192
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:05,559
go into the heavy stuff and then people

1193
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,440
can leave if they get lost exactly or if

1194

toore kind of try to keep things uh

1208
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,440
simple so everybody can kind of grasp it

1209
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,800
and then you know from there you can

1210
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,200
delve into it a little bit more because

1211
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,680
um a lot of Growers you know when they

1212
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,799
use bottle nutrients they they go to the

1213
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,598
hydro store and they ask you know what

1214
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,240

like you know you got to do some

1217
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,000
research to to be a grower and and your

1255
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,920
Organics like without a couple of

1256
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,280
conversations between Spence and Shawn

1257
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,880
I'd still be using the

1258
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,359
bottles it's it's not worth it and

1259
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,559
Nester yeah shout out SP I don't know if

1261
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,599
Nester up in Denver he's one a few cups

1262
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,838
uh I forget the shop he used to grow for

1263
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,519
but that dude gave a talk one night

1264
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:38,078
about soil Recycling and reconditioning

1265
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,358
things there's there's a lot my brain so

1266
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
hopefully you know we can definitely get

1267
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,598
on here again and have some more uh

1268
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,118
conversations and get into things a

1269
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,200
little bit more in dep this is my just

1270
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,318
this is my one argument with Organics

1271
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:51,879
right all right with your plants if if

1272
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:53,960
okay when you go to put serious when you

1273
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,680
go to put it in your plant I want you to

1274
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,358
freaking drink it before you put it in

1275
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,879
your plant and if you don't feel

1276
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,279
comfortable doing that then don't use it

1277
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,920
on your plant I will eat anything in my

1278
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,640
garden right now just thr that out there

1279
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,358
even the Worm poop even I'll eat

1280
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,480
perfectly fine you will not have to pay

1281
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:14,920
me to ingest something in the garden

1282
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,280
that we have um everything is how it

1283
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,119
should be you as a patient you medicate

1284
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,680
in many different ways and one of those

1285
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,318
ways is ingesting raw cannabis as a

1286
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,960
plant you know uh juicing the leaves the

1287
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,000
nugs there's a lot of um beneficials for

1288
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,159
that with pain

1289
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,519
fibromyalgia um you know just uh with

1290
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,799
antibiotics in in the Cannabis so

1291
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,440
releasing a lot of more of those

1292
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,240
cannaboids that aren't available what

1293
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,280
you can you know smoke or ingest through

1294
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,799
Edibles and some people can't take

1295
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,040
Edibles or ingest and that's not what

1296
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,680
they're looking for so you know having a

1297
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:51,880
plant that you can actually um chew you

1298
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,159
know it's it's what should be like with

1299
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,200
any vegetable or flour you should be

1300
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,679
able to eat it you know medicine I

1301
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,399
believe it it should be food grade

1302
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,799
that's kind of how I look at it if it's

1303
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,519
going to if you're going to be treating

1304
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,079
it as medicine then it should be food

1305
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,960
grade recreational purposes you know it

1306
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:09,400
is what it is but if you're going to be

1307
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,720
uh for example a medical dispensary I'm

1308
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,200
calling you out quit using the [ __ ] if

1309
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:14,879
you want to know how to grow proper

1310
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,759
cannabis for your dispensaries get out

1311
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,240
of sick people don't need Phat I mean

1312
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,920
they really don't and there's there's

1313
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,439
even other companies other Eagle 20 oh I

1314
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,880
had a conversation about that earlier

1315
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,200
take that off your shelf people people

1316
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,079
take everything off your

1317
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:33,239
I wouldn't say that just people need to

1318
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,760
educate themselves uh don't go jump into

1319
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,439
Organics don't go and read every organic

1320
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,400
book and buy everything in there because

1321
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,119
that's just as bad I mean there's

1322
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,960
reasons that you mean I would almost say

1323
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,358
you synthetics instead of bone meal or

1324
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,079
blood meal because those care those are

1325
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,799
more harmful than they are good same

1326
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,680
thing with glacial Rock Dust uh sof Rock

1327
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,318
phosphates different things like that

1328
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,960
asites they carry heavy metals and used

1329
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,880
in large quantities like a lot of these

1330
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,679
super soils call for you're putting more

1331
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,960
the same if not more heavy metals into

1332
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,960
your plant you using chelated nutrients

1333
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,159
exactly so you really want to educate

1334
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,119
yourself and that's key I I really want

1335
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,358
to emphasize that if it's for medical

1336
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,318
purposes and you won't ingest the it

1337
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,960
yourself if it's not food grade it's not

1338
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:22,719
medical grade exactly so I can eat worm

1339
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,280
castings you can all day long I wouldn't

1340
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,639
recommend it but the the the basis is is

1341
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,160
you're not going to get sick it's not

1342
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,558
going to hurt you up a little bit you

1343
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,519
know I'm just that's kind of where I'm

1344
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,480
coming from is that you know if if it

1345
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,280
says keep Out Of Reach of children and

1346
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,079
it has a warning label of like what to

1347
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,880
do when you get it in your eyes that's

1348
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:42,519
that's not cool I mean if it's like if I

1349
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,440
can't touch it if it can't touch my skin

1350
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:45,759
why can't it touch my plant right

1351
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,079
exactly and that's really where I'm

1352
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,960
coming from I I feel like people are

1353
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,160
just not aware like I said just educate

1354
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,039
yourselves and not every organic option

1355
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,960
is the best or you know

1356
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,079
and bone meal uh that's slaughterhouse

1357
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,199
product that's cow

1358
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,680
leftover yeah especially depending on

1359
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,118
where you Source it from a feather meal

1360
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,719
the that's just as that's even worse

1361
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:11,760
feather meal McDonald's chicken farm

1362
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,000
cover crops you know barley and stuff

1363
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,559
like that like that you're going to use

1364
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,318
as a mulch you know watch out where you

1365
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,240
get that from you don't want any dyes or

1366
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:22,199
any pesticides used with that like 99%

1367
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,358
of corn is all GMO so for your seed

1368
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,159
sprouted

1369

teas that was a weird noise W okay

1370

that's what happens when touches there

1371
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,920
that was pretty

1372
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,598
neat that's what happens when the en

1373
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,440
cord touches the microphone or the

1374

1416
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,200
the best books I've ever read it teaches

1417
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,200
you what you can and can't use for sure

1418
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,239
it was detrimental in yeah creating who

1419
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,719
I am today for the

1420
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,679
of that it taught me what things were

1421
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:33,798
where they were from it really opened my

1422
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,879
eyes to how you can create your own

1423
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,318
nutrients and that you should just take

1424
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,079
everything the first time I mixed up my

1425
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:40,880
own tea That's the book I grabbed for

1426
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,440
instructions that was my first jump into

1427
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,400
Organics and that goes right back though

1428
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,798
to you know if you depending on how you

1429
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,000
personally want to garden and what level

1430
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,838
of Organics you want to be on you know

1431
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,280
that's where you want to take things

1432
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:54,558
with the grain of salt so you might not

1433
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,798
want to use all of the phosphate

1434
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,200
products or you might not want to use

1435
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:59,639
all of the animal based product more

1436
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,439
it's definitely a good uh kind of a good

1437
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,598
guideline there you got and that's the

1438
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,798
thing with growing cannabis you're doing

1439
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,798
it your way it's like music uh John

1440
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:09,400
bonam might have played it and you could

1441
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:11,358
play it and give it your own flavor you

1442
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,240
know put put open high hat somewhere and

1443
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,239
do your thing with it because your

1444
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:17,199
plants are in a different room you can

1445
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,000
we can mix up the same exact NES and

1446
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,480
feed all all of our plants that and some

1447
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,880
of our plants are going to be pissed off

1448
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,559
completely different it's all got it's

1449
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,880
like having girlfriends man one of them

1450
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,480
is not going to like the same as the

1451
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,440
other one let's not even getting into

1452
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:36,280
that you're probably smart I try

1453
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,200
sometimes you know yeah so I'd say that

1454
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,119
uh we you know the t is a good place to

1455
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,798
start okay and then you while you're

1456
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,519
reading through that or before you read

1457
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:47,798
through that I would recommend everybody

1458
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,318

1459
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:52,798

1460
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:54,838
read some sort of hor hante or Ed Rose

1461
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,838

Oaker Dam cor guide It's marijuana

1465
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,480

1466
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,559
that don't cut Corners in your room

1467
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,240
sometimes you might have to in the

1468
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,720
beginning but as you go something to do

1469
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:16,199
is definitely upgrade your room dial it

1470
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:18,279
in have an environment uh with the

1471
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,838
Organics the one thing that you're

1472
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,240
you're trying to do is mimic nature to

1473
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:27,920
to your fullest and um when growing in a

1474
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:30,639
pot and using uh a chelated nutrient in

1475
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,760
a bottle you there's nothing living

1476
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,598
going on there there's no nature so by

1477
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,920
bringing that you know those microbes

1478
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:40,920
into your pot you're doing so much to

1479
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,798
your plant you know it's it's actually

1480
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,039
you know going back to what it should

1481
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:45,880
and it might take it a little bit some

1482
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,639
strains you know might freak out

1483
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,358
depending on where you get it from but

1484
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,400
if you're going to do Organics and you

1485
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,880
know you like to uh start from seed

1486
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,519
definitely start from seed um start from

1487
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,599
seed yeah get some good quality genetics

1488
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,318
don't skimp on that um cuts are good but

1489
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,880
uh definitely a good way to grow is

1490
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,358
start some seeds you know jump in and

1491
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,680
even if it's bag seed you know it's yeah

1492
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:09,960
I don't I don't oppose growing a bag

1493
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,039
seed no it's not bad dog was a bag seed

1494
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,240
yeah uh you know if you got a bag seed

1495
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:17,079
and it turns out to be you know a reg

1496
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,479
seed um you know pollen happens and you

1497
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,318
know it might be beneficial for you to

1498
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,639
let it happen the first time who knows

1499
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,358
but that's a whole another subject as

1500
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:24,960
well as long as they're not all female

1501
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,279
all right more books more books more you

1502
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,880
back on track yeah after you I'd read T

1503
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,920
um would be one of the first ones

1504
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,400
marijuana horiculture Ed Rosenthal some

1505
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,400
sort of basic book uh his books are

1506
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,440
amazing just because they touch on so

1507
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,200
many different bases it's a great

1508
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,920
Gateway and when you read books like

1509
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,318
that if you're not familiar with like

1510
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Academia and like going to school and

1511
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:48,960
things like that it really helps

1512
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,838
recharge you and teaches you how to

1513
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,639
research and teach how to learn um and

1514
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:56,480
that's where I really recommend reading

1515
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:58,598
books and that's where the Rev uh like

1516
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,880
like I think pinpoints his book is

1517
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:03,039
getting handson to people that aren't

1518
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,920
necessarily like Sean said uh you know

1519
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,400
book smart or can sit in a classroom and

1520
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,838
learn something the Rev will tell a joke

1521
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,559
in the middle of a parag yeah he'll

1522
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,400
he'll go totally off you off so if if

1523
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,040
you you know if you think like oh man I

1524
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,599
hate reading or if you're not like that

1525
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:17,159
type of just try it and I promise and

1526
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,599
it's different when you when you want to

1527
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:22,039
learn something but yeah so I would go

1528
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,960
with those books those are great bases

1529
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:25,719
uh and then you when you want to start

1530
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,119
getting a little bit more advanced

1531
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:30,919
obviously most people are familiar have

1532
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:33,119
heard of teaming with microbes yeah so

1533
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:37,358
that one's it's a little complex that

1534
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:39,519
one I read over and over and over again

1535
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,639
it's it's kind of it's a quick reference

1536
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,440
book when you so you'll use the revs

1537
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,960
book a lot you'll see when you as a

1538
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,200
beginner and you're mixing soils and

1539
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,240
you're making te's you're going to have

1540
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,239
that it's going to you're going to end

1541
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:50,199
up buying six copies of it because

1542
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:51,558
you're going to have it next to your

1543
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:53,639
Brewer and you're going to leave it on

1544
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,880
the you know if you don't know how to do

1545
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:57,920
something he he starts you off and he

1546
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,599
let you know that you might mess up but

1547
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,599
you know like you said smell your teas

1548
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,480
they smell but the teaming with microbes

1549
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,440
book will eventually become like that

1550
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,920
for you once you kind of you know once

1551
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,880
you get to the next level you're going

1552
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,639
to start getting there but once you've

1553
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,760
covered your your basis and you you're a

1554
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:16,279
little bit more familiar with the you

1555
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,160
know soil food web and how things work

1556
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,798
as far as nutrient cycling and you get a

1557
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,719
little bit more familiar with compost

1558
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:23,358
tea inputs why you're using them and

1559
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,838
you're really like oh you know what this

1560
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,239
is this is cool I'm using my even if

1561
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,279
you're using your bottled organic

1562
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:30,719
nutrient you got your earthworm castings

1563
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,000
in your mix you're doing your weekly

1564
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,439
teas and you're rolling and you're like

1565
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,039
man this is cool I want to take it to

1566
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,599
the next level I've already read these

1567
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:40,280
books uh especially if you live in a

1568
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,400
state to where you don't really you know

1569
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,680
not everybody's open about growing yeah

1570
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,880
don't be afraid where I would go is uh

1571
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,639
then where I would turn is uh like where

1572
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,280
we were kind of talking about earlier

1573
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:54,759
you know there's a lot of PDF files

1574
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,960
about uh Korean natural farming uh

1575
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,039
different things like that natural

1576
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,599
farming

1577
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,280
inputs that's where I would recommend

1578
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,519
going once you kind of get comfortable

1579
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,798
with your basis and that'll tell you how

1580
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,798
you can actually make your own

1581
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:09,838
inoculates how you can make your own

1582
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:11,400
fertilizers and that's where save all

1583
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,519
your money yeah the unconventional

1584
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,838
farmer shows that but the Rev um getting

1585
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,798
back to this since this is like a

1586
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,480
beginning into Organics he shows you

1587
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:21,318
different ways to do it that might suit

1588
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,559
your um grow style if you don't want to

1589
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,318
necessarily um do tees but just want to

1590
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,599
use waters he talks about like nutrient

1591
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:31,639
spikes that put your that areal and

1592
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:34,200
that's how I first got into Organics um

1593
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,519
I just I couldn't have some Plantside so

1594
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:37,078
I needed to put them outdoors and not

1595
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,719
have to check on them that much so I

1596
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,318
said why not try it and it worked out

1597
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:43,078
pretty pretty well don't uh don't overdo

1598
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:44,440
it that's for sure okay cuz you can

1599
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:46,240
really mess things up I think I think

1600
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,000
actually said on like what maybe the

1601
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,279
first show about how I actually ran a

1602
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,440
lot of the Rev stuff yeah yeah yeah

1603
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,640
[ __ ] my world up yeah but you know you

1604
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,559
got to learn somewhere animal proteins

1605
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,920
and you could really overdo a lot of you

1606
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,079
can really burn your plants they get

1607
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,639
super hot they need to decompose uh over

1608
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,480
time you need to give them their their

1609
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:06,358
moment to shine in your soil so you

1610
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,559
don't the revs I wouldn't try the revs

1611
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,038
mix yeah what I would do is uh if you

1612
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:13,720
really want to start mixing your own

1613
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,079
soil and like you really you're just

1614
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,439
[ __ ] just determined on it and you're

1615
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,000
going to the Hydra store and you're

1616
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,358
going to pick up some

1617
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,039
amendments basically if you're going to

1618
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,318
go with the back soil it doesn't matter

1619
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,200
you can go Sunshine 4 you can go promid

1620
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:31,480
you can a Happy Frog it doesn't matter

1621
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,118
um just pick what you want I personally

1622
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,880
would recommend you going with a sterile

1623
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,960
medium something with not no real

1624
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,640
nutrient pack to it yeah start from a

1625
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,000
laboratory standpoint I would recommend

1626
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:45,279
like a PRX or base Sunshine mix or even

1627
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,599
a sunshine Advanced uh think those

1628
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,599
options are really great if you don't

1629
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,720
even want to buy your own baged soil

1630
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,440
then just go and pick up a brick of Pete

1631
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:57,838
Moss from Lowe's go and get you a bag of

1632
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:00,280
peite from you know the hydro store yeah

1633
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,719
or the farming store Garden Supply Store

1634
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,000
just watch out because you know

1635
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:05,358
sometimes when you source that stuff

1636
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,679
things can come in it so uh you might

1637
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,440
want to treat it naturally before you

1638
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:12,440
start using it or you know keep an eye

1639
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,639
on it cuz uh pests are everywhere little

1640
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,960
bugs microbes are everywhere fungus and

1641
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:18,358
you know you don't want to bring in how

1642
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,400
much are my worm casting is going to

1643
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:22,038
help me keep away those pests well

1644
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,760
that's going to build up just everything

1645
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:26,720
in the soil around your rizosphere that

1646
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,559
the plant needs you know it's going to

1647
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,719
start um fighting the fight before your

1648
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:34,400
plant's even growing you know so it's

1649
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,798
like uh I don't know like an antibiotic

1650
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,720
it's I mean you're going to it's going

1651
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:39,159
to help build your plant's immune system

1652
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:40,959
like you said it'll start fighting it

1653
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:43,798
from the inside out that kind of goes

1654
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,760
back down into building and kiten eating

1655
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:48,679
bacteria and how that cycled through the

1656
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,559
plant I'd love to come to we're going to

1657
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,239
get some CL tell Jeff you want classes

1658
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,559
cuz I really want to get to talking

1659
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,399
about like the different as like what is

1660
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,680
in our castings and why they work yeah

1661
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,200
we'll do we'll do more episod for sure

1662
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:04,318
on I'll have you guys back soon because

1663
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,558
I want to do an episode about like um we

1664
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,558
can't have everybody guys we're not

1665
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,920
telling you throw away the bottle of

1666
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,079
nutrients today that's not what anyone's

1667
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,720
saying we want to find a balance for you

1668
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,400
uh so that'll be one of our next topic

1669
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:15,480
is the find the balance between the

1670
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,680
bottles and the Organics yeah in the

1671
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,920
meantime yeah just don't yeah don't toss

1672
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,639
your bottled

1673
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,519
nutrients don't throw anything away

1674
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:26,519
slowly pick get some worm castings start

1675
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,838
making teas and then slowly start

1676
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,679
working things out it's not like a o

1677
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:32,558
you're not just going to magically

1678
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,399
become an organic Gardener right dip

1679
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,519
your foot in the water yeah this could

1680
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,880
be the way to way improve your growing

1681
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:39,759
though this could make your buds taste

1682
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,880
better uh it'll make them grow bigger

1683
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,680
Taste of yeah you can smell it in this

1684
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,440
room it's just sweeter and who knows

1685
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,318
there's a lot of Growers who uh will

1686
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,000
actually go to make the transition and

1687
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:51,000
then find their nice little happy spot

1688
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,639
in the middle and nothing's wrong with

1689
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,719
that you know if that's what you want as

1690
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,279
a grower I know a lot of people who are

1691
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,838
really happy and just kill it growing

1692
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,440
synthetics and Organics together so yeah

1693
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,000
like you said it can really improve your

1694
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,599
growing style and whether you want to

1695
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,039
commit to going fully organic or you

1696
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,200
want to run synthetics I think that

1697
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,680
everybody could benefit from just a

1698
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,399
little bit of worm some of the flower

1699
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:14,679
that we're actually smoking tonight uh

1700
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,639
was grown by a friend uh that works at

1701
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:18,078
the uh grow Warehouse in Colorado

1702
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:19,838
Springs who uses Rocky Mountain worm

1703
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,880
castings but he integrates it with

1704
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,838
nectar of the Gods but he uses nectar of

1705
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,838
the Gods in a very low dosage with uh

1706
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:29,558
te's and he uses cover crops and things

1707
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:32,838
like that so he does practice a um you

1708
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:35,359
know an organic um style of growing but

1709
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:37,358
it's not full organic permaculture it's

1710
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,679
got that bottle kick yeah it's got that

1711
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:41,239
little boost that it needs um but the

1712
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,000
training wheels yeah the training wheels

1713
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:46,439
but he's you know he is actually a uh an

1714
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
arborist I've been looking into that um

1715
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,760
so one of the things that we want to try

1716
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,599
to be able to present through Jay is uh

1717
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,079
if it holds any Merit to anybody out

1718
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:56,359
there we're going to call it Rocky Mount

1719
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,480
natural farming certified

1720
01:00:56,358 --> 01:00:59,838
so what we'll do is uh we're going to

1721
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,760
try to start looking into some of these

1722
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:04,480
products for you and we will R

1723
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,960
everything we'll give it our stamp of

1724
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,760
approval and there is no Armory listing

1725
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,960
for us man there is no there's I mean

1726
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,599
there is an army listing on certain you

1727
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,199
know bottled nutrients and stuff but we

1728
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,160
have nothing to really go off of we need

1729
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,038
to create some sort of system and that's

1730
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:23,838
what we're really hoping to do you

this is a better option yeah not

1898
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:32,278
everything that's in a bottle is bad

1899
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,400
some companies do care what their

1900
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:36,318
patients are putting into their plants

1901
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,000
and into their medicine so there are

1902
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,960
some good uh companies so like I said NE

1903
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,880
you're buying a lot of water just do

1904
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,318
buying a lot when you yeah when you go

1905
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,760
to the hydro store and you're asking

1906
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:50,798
somebody a question go to the bottle and

1907
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,000
read things a lot of companies put a

1908
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:55,038
face on their brand and that's marketing

1909
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,760
and that's not what Organics is Organics

1910
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,920
is actually like having the product and

1911
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,200
it does what it does a lot of bottles

1912
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,039
put things on their labels to make you

1913
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,960
go towards the bottle that exactly the

1914
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,400
same thing another nutrient line that

1915
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,599
might be a little cheaper and it's just

1916
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,278
you know it's the same value that's why

1917
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:12,559
some companies change their label every

1918
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:15,358
three months a big inside secret you

1919

up my I logo and end up in all my food

2007
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,840

place I love it I love it I'm just going

2010
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,640
to shorten it up I'll use the same

2011
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,600
necklace I'm just going to make it a

2012

little shorter I'll rock it every day

2013

length yeah out of the like my food bowl

2017

01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,319
a community so let's uh let's come

2028
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,079
together so one random question to you

2029
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:49,920
guys I'm adding ogt into my mix with my

2030
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,639
worm castings I'm just wasting money now

2031
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,679
huh I wouldn't use it yeah don't ogt is

2032
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:58,760
a soft rock phosphate uh

2033
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,279
trisum which has actually been taken out

2034
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,679
of like great white and a couple other

2035
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:03,198
products they cycle nutrients too

2036
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,520
quickly I don't know if you're familiar

2037
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,799
with OG bowar but it's the same reason

2038
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,960
they recommend not using the new pack

2039
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,199
with a hydroponic system it'll actually

2040
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,039
cycle nutrients out of the plant okay

2041
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:16,198
yeah be careful I just worm castings man

2042
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,479
you don't even need and you don't even

2043
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,759
need the Molasses you just answered a

2044
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:20,198
question I had I have a few plants that

2045
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,360
are showing some deficiencies and

2046
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:26,279
they're fed and it's because I put so

2047
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,880
much ogt in there so just take you feed

2048
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,039
too much of a certain things you know it

2049
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,520
can lock out other things yeah but you

2050
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:33,880
never would think that ogt would cause

2051
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,280
you a problem you would assume so you

2052
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,039
know that's one of the good I I guess

2053
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:39,719
that's one of the good things about ogt

2054
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:43,679
is a little bit goes a long way they use

2055
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:45,679
a very aggressive uh you know form of

2056
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,760
it's like a third of a cup to 25 gallons

2057
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,520
of water they they try to give your

2058
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,679
plant that boost you know that you don't

2059
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,639
get with uh the organic sometimes cuz

2060
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,440
the plant's you know still becoming

2061
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:59,480
itself but yes bottom line with J using

2062
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:01,559
Rocky Mal worm castings no don't use you

2063
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:03,198
don't need to use OG GT definitely not

2064
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,320
you hear that guys and I'm not a hater

2065
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,359
of ogt but these worm castings are

2066
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:09,479
ridiculously are

2067
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,039
the and then if you want to put soft

2068
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:12,678
