crop fred is halfway through his first

62
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,800

63
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,959
bit of guidance on how to properly take

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,489

123
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,709
dope-ass mothership so I was like hang

124
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,090
out we'll put you on a podcast so we're

125
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,939
gonna talk a little bit about seed

126
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:34,589
breeding BRABUS got a bunch of notes I

127
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,850
was there anywhere you'd like to start

128
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,359
with bro cuz you were looking at that

129
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,889
thing pretty intently um I think we

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,590
should start from the beginning okay

131
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,720
like we'll write the moment exception

132
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,159
basically you know when when the seed

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,080
starts you know when to pollinate and

134
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,599
yeah okay I had a pollinate like the

135
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,339
timing wise in ACCA's versus the TVs

136
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:54,478
okay so hopefully you've got yourself a

137
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,888
solid male that we've talked about

138
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,538
before actually you came and talked

139
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,189
about that with me ah so hopefully we've

140
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:01,740
got a solid male you've got your females

141
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:05,370
chosen and now it is time to actually

142
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,490
breathe some plants so if you're gonna

143
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,180
pick some indica plants when should we

144
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,460
start to Paul

145
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,170
our indica plants I would say between

146
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,759
week three and four when your bud sets

147
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,900
really starting to form up for the first

148
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,939
time I would say when they get about you

149
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,370
know good nickel to quarter size okay

150
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,569
that way that way you got plenty of cuz

151
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,009
because what it's really gonna determine

152
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,599
down on this how many hairs you have

153
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,039
basically how many pistols you have yeah

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,850
and they're they're what carry the

155
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,160
pollen down

156
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,780
they actually make the progress happen

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,350
so when you see the pistols nice and

158
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,429
thick

159
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,930
it kind of looks like you got some

160
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,400
little spiders going on but when those

161
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,530
dandelions when the hairs and the

162
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,209
dandelions I know that's such such

163
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,069
obvious terms but when those pistols get

164
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,719
thick and ready that's when that plant

165
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,459
is ovulating and it wants to receive

166
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,110
that male pollen so thank you and your

167
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,180
indica plants you're absolutely right

168
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,860
about three weeks ish about day 21 to

169
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,350
about a twenty eight ish is usually when

170
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,819
I try to hit an indica dominant you can

171
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,470
get away with maybe sometime week four

172
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,730
if it's you know bred out with a sativa

173
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,260
or something like that has a slightly

174
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,939
longer found flowering time you know you

175
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,469
you just really have to use your best

176
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,420
judgment you know but typically week

177
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,250
three is about the money for it alright

178
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,470
in my opinion how about if we're working

179
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,610
with a more sativa dominant plant do you

180
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,960
want to go a little bit later you think

181
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,970
you do you really do want to get a

182
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,709
little bit later and the reason being

183
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,210
because if you do to it do do a

184
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,339
pollination too early you're not gonna

185
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:21,689
get the seed stock you want and then

186
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,099
they also might be sitting in the plant

187
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,139
for too long in the plant by to not be

188
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,689
right but the proceeds will be so the

189
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,789
seeds will overripe and just like any

190
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,699
fruit or anything else out there it

191
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,020
can't overripe and I've seen them pop

192
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,430
inside the bud before I've seen all

193
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,259
kinds of things actually seen a seed

194
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,629
germinate itself inside of a button so

195
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,060
that's [ __ ] amazing I know when you

196
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,949
guys say indigent Stevie Tom out the

197
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,660
female you're using or the cross that

198
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,219
you're trying to get the female that

199
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,660
we're starting with yeah the girl that's

200
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:55,710
going to receive the pollen yeah the

201
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:57,480
girl that's why wills here were

202
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:01,109
definitely referring to the female for

203
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,060
sure okay yes it's a deep abdominal

204
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,830
plants you usually do where we beat week

205
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,449
4 week five usually typically a week or

206
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,289
two later than you would an indica you

207
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,639
know you really have to judge the

208
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,319
flowering period if it's a nine ten

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,209
weeks the Teva you know you want you

210
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,800
want to leave them basically what you're

211
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,829
leaving looking for is about a four to

212
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,350
five we get of just the plants going

213
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,729
through growth normal regular solid

214
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,920
growth for about four to five weeks

215
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,330
that's gonna make that seed go

216
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,670
and start to finish and really finish

217
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:30,029
out nicely from from starts and a embryo

218
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,400
to seed to harvest all right so we've

219
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,989
got pollen when should we put should we

220
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,169
put our males and females into the

221
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,250
flowering room at the same time um I

222
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,430
think it really depends on your

223
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,339
situation the easiest way to do it if

224
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,540
somebody's worried about getting

225
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,949
cross-pollination with other females and

226
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,470
things like that is to bring the female

227
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,079
out of the room or use a smaller room

228
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,480
like us maybe like a small 2x2 or 3x3

229
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,430
grow tent I've seen people even go down

230
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,129
and use something as cheap as a very

231
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,870
large cardboard box like like something

232
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:02,639
for a refrigerator or like the largest

233
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,470
box you can get at you call okay put a

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,969
CFL in it for your males you know and

235
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,200
stuff like that and just let them go and

236
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,730
then throw the female and they're just

237
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,740
for the day or two it need to do its

238
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,960
thing and okay you know right pull it

239
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,329
back out and then it's the deed is done

240
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,189
let it sit spray it down with tap water

241
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,560
introduce it back into the flower room

242
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,209
so you don't cross pollinate okay the

243
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,800
way I do it since I am when I spoon I

244
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,629
pollinate I do the whole room I don't

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,610
even [ __ ] around I know that I'm gonna

246
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,620
cry entire room so I'll get that male

247
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,000
nice and beefy and when he's full of

248
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,439
pollen and hopefully I've got him time

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,850
depth where my girls are about three to

250
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,139
four weeks in I just take him in there

251
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,000
and put him in front of the fan and give

252
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,199
him a good shake smack the sticks a

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,450
little bit and that pollen goes

254
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,379
everywhere okay everywhere but that's

255
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,390
only if you're trying to do the whole

256
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,220
room right if you're trying to time it

257
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,049
and you don't know how long your male

258
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,269
plant is going to take to start busting

259
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:50,909
a nut that's when it's time to flower

260
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,590
him early and take pollen from him and

261
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,389
collect the pollen into a container and

262
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,310
then you can apply pollen to the

263
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,480
branches you want or you can walk in

264
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,759
there and hold that jar up pollen in

265
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,230
front of a fan and shake it you can kind

266
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,909
of salt and pepper sprinkle the plants

267
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,830
if you'd like there's several ways to

268
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,049
apply the pollen that's exactly how I do

269
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,629
it as a breeder I buy harvest pollen

270
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,029
first and then choose females secondly

271
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:13,559
okay so I always harvest Paul and I keep

272
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,079
good storage appalling good waste or

273
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,149
pollen is a good question

274
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,000
I get asked all the time how do you

275
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,649
store your pollen um I I just used a

276
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,019
very clean container I wiped out with

277
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,429
alcohol first let it dry really good and

278
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,600
then wipe it out with water to make sure

279
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:30,120
there's no alcohol left that's gonna

280
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,800
kill the pollen and I don't use tap

281
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,179
water I use an RO water or distilled

282
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,339
water that way there's no chlorine

283
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,750
present so it won't destroy the pollen

284
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,370
right let it dry real well

285
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,409
that's it let it dry really well you can

286
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,019
use a dried rice is a really good thing

287
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,610
to use I've seen growers use dried rice

288
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,470
but the main thing is when you go to

289
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,240
store pollen is to make sure there's no

290
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,370
green material left over or any kind of

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,139
bug material or leaked material present

292
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,700
in the pollen whenever you're going

293
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,960
through there after harvesting it cuz

294
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,950
there's gonna be little pieces here and

295
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,440
there and what that's gonna do is it's

296
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,820
gonna create a moisture spot inside of

297
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,680
that pollen and it's gonna start molding

298
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,210
and that's where you can cuz cuz water

299
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,829
breeds bacteria that's basically right

300
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,060
what's down to and the bacteria is gonna

301
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,430
take over and it's gonna render your

302
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,829
pollen useless I do a very similar

303
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,419
method I'll collect the pollen from the

304
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,950
male and then I will have a clone of

305
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,689
that male and I'll flour him right

306
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,910
alongside my ladies so that I'm sure

307
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,590
that right around the proper day I know

308
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:22,049
that each of my ladies will get dusted

309
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,460
with the proper amount of pollen I'm

310
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,559
double double teaming it a little bit

311
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,060
and I'm kind of a weirdo I might be a

312
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,039
cannabis hoarder because I always like

313
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,419
to keep a little bit of pollen like just

314
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,919
in case something goes wrong I've still

315
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,569
got some of that pollen that's that's

316
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,379
what I love to do keep it back you never

317
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,690
know when you're gonna come across

318
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,059
something to say you know that one male

319
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,650
would be really good with right maybe a

320
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,719
new cut that you just gotten tried for

321
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,009
the first time and you realize hey wait

322
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
a minute if I would have had that male

323
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,629
or if I had that pollen I could just

324
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,339
made a masterpiece yeah yes so I've got

325
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,960
that pollen I like you were saying keep

326
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,640
it in a clean jar or a container I keep

327
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,470
mine in to clean those little tiny mason

328
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,000
jars like a baby food sized mason jar

329
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,830
and then I keep that in a brown paper

330
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,419
bag so there's no light getting to it

331
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,759
and then I actually put that in my spare

332
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,509
refrigerator right next to my silver

333
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,509
thiosulfate solution

334
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:15,659
I think cold is more preservative than

335
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,700
Heat exactly I think things will

336
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,409
deteriorate and degrade and [ __ ] goes

337
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,839
wrong more quickly and heat in nature

338
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,250
slows everything down so that's you keep

339
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,140
your food and your meats and [ __ ] I

340
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,730
don't keep any meat but I mean if you do

341
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:31,620
you keep that [ __ ] in a fridge keep it

342
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,240
cool just keep your also keep some seeds

343
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,190
in a cooler and I haven't seen any

344
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,379
difference in the seeds that I have kept

345
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,970
not in a cooler and in a cooler my other

346
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,039
seeds go in a safe I've got a big gun

347
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,790
safe filled with seeds the seeds that

348
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,319
were in the cooler

349
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,480
I've germinated those with the same

350
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,940
exact success rate as non cooled seeds

351
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,250
absolutely

352
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,790
all right so we know when to pollinate

353
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,440
the plants we know it's gonna take about

354
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:55,969
five to six weeks for those plants once

355
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,340
the pollination happens you'll see the

356
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,899
pistils curl up right now they'll be

357
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,120
clear looking they're white they're kind

358
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,559
of like clear veiny white tips what's

359
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,450
that pollen hits they're gonna crinkle

360
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,159
up like claws like like arthritis

361
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,870
fingers they're gonna start turning

362
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,429
brown that's how you know the

363
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,310
pollination has happened now the pollen

364
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,199
is moving up the up the pistol and into

365
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:17,539
the ovule and you're now actually making

366
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,030
a seed let's talk a little bit about

367
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:22,519
what to feed plants that we're putting

368
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,079
seeds into I like to give them a lot of

369
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,399
carbs I like to give him a lot of carbs

370
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,660
and sugar lots of energy and a good

371
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,429
little bloom booster that's that's about

372
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,959
all I really do to him other than that I

373
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,459
do give him a little extra nitrogen or

374
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,660
flour than I normally would because the

375
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,120
plants gonna use a little bit of extra

376
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,709
everything just for Mom would create a

377
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
baby inside of her she's gonna try to

378
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,150
she's gonna it's got to so you got to

379
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,650
take that concept and relay that into

380
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,970
your plan you know you you're creating

381
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,490
thousands of seeds so those offspring

382
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,379
have and they need they need nutrients

383
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,149
they need food to be able to grow

384
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:51,559
healthy and strong just like a baby

385
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,990
would or anything else would so

386
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,509
completely use as much light as possible

387
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,220
when you're breeding light is absolutely

388
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,990
definitely helpful you'll multiply your

389
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,639
amounts of seeds if you step up step up

390
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,049
from a four hundred to a six hundred to

391
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,699
a thousand you'll see the amount of seed

392
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,409
introduced and the quality of the seeds

393
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
those little white seeds won't happen if

394
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,879
you use a thousand you only get those

395
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,340
with a four or six yeah I actually used

396
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,169
sixes I do a twelve twelve regimen when

397
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,110
I'm when I go into flower for a breeding

398
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,209
project yeah yeah yeah but I actually I

399
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,220
used six hundreds but uh even like you

400
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,080
were saying it will help butter faster

401
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,509
with a brighter light source right or

402
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,400
hotter light source and so typically

403
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,569
what I do like this time of year I take

404
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,490
them and put them outside for the last

405
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,520
week to ripen let the UV rays really

406
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,799
taken over and not only does it increase

407
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,509
the THC and bombard the plant at all at

408
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,039
one time it really it really looks good

409
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,819
on the charts after it's cut down oh I

410
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,159
bet something about making oil out of

411
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,540
plants that were seeded once those

412
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,579
plants so we'll talk about this in a

413
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:51,079
minute but once the plants are finished

414
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,820
you take the seeds out you've got a

415
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,139
bunch of material laughs right I like to

416
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,790
take that material to one of my good

417
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,860
friends like will that makes hash for me

418
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:00,099
and the concentrates that come out of

419
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,379
that you get such an amazing high the

420
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,420
it's all there's more of a you know I

421
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,370
don't get a psychedelic high but it is

422
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,958
more of a psychedelic feeling you get

423
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,879
more of a mind trip from it you get more

424
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:15,008
body high from it it does something to

425
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:16,269
the oil it certainly does alright so we

426
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,528
know what to feed the plants now we want

427
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,870
to give them lots of carbs a little more

428
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:21,129
nitrogen you see you're still gonna have

429
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,389
to flush just like you normally would

430
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,679
before he cut down the plants you guys

431
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,028
keep that in mind always

432
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,370
I wanted to interrupt with something

433
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:29,350
that I saw on Facebook

434
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,970
I won't call them out but hopefully they

435
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,850
listen to the podcast they posted to

436
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,680
Facebook I found this stud mail time to

437
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,899
put him outside for the season and see

438
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,879
what he can do so that I can collect

439
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,730
some pollen as essentially what he said

440
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:47,588
so many bells went off in my head I saw

441
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,659
the post everybody four four miles of

442
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,269
this dude that is growing outdoors is

443
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:55,299
going to have a hybrid of whatever this

444
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,990
dude put outside yeah the wind and

445
00:14:55,299 --> 00:15:00,159
nature are going to do their things and

446
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,100
this guy's gonna pollinate the whole

447
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,360
[ __ ] neighborhood don't do that you

448
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,889
guys if you've got a male plant don't

449
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,750
put it outside so that you can pollinate

450
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,789
Rob's outdoor crops and you can [ __ ]

451
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,059
pollinate and everybody's outdoor crop

452
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:14,919
don't do that [ __ ] please be be a Fink

453
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,629
full thinker a thankful STONER I don't

454
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,759
even be a for thinking grower is what I

455
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:22,259
need you to be don't put that [ __ ] out

456
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,259
there that's rude please don't do that

457
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:35,948
silence they think they just want to

458
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:36,729
stand up and walk away would be

459
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,068
acceptable

460
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,649
alright so plants are gonna grow about

461
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:44,019
six weeks until the seeds are ready ish

462
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,938
ah what should we start looking for

463
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,139
during that time period to know if the

464
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:48,338
seeds are getting ready or if we're

465
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,230
gonna have to let them go a little bit

466
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:54,790
longer well usually what I'll do if

467
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:56,319
there's none sometimes the they'll split

468
00:15:54,789 --> 00:16:04,328
and you'll actually start seeing the

469
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:05,979
seeds president actually split and he

470
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,419
likes to protrude from it sometimes you

471
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,980
know when the ripe and then you'll

472
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,870
actually see the visual see just see a

473
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,670
nice gray dark color you'll see nice

474
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,720
tiger stripes yeah white tiger stripes

475
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,919
is what you're looking for a lot

476
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,778
the time then you know you got a nice

477
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,299
ripe seed you basically want to look for

478
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:20,559
no green and no white that's that's

479
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,000
pretty much the two things you've really

480
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,469
got to look for there's no green and no

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,828
white you got Tiger stripes and you got

482
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,420
great nice gray seas or dark seeds and

483
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:31,599
typically you know you're ready a cheap

484
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:33,099
move that I do after about six weeks of

485
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
pollination five and a half six weeks of

486
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,509
pollination I wait and then right at the

487
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,578
base of the buds or the stalk in the bud

488
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:41,350
meat there's usually one little calyx

489
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:42,758
that swells up I'll just pinch that

490
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,920
[ __ ] all right roll it around in my

491
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,139
hand and it you'll know it's either a

492
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,639
seed or what would have been a seed had

493
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,049
you not destroyed it and you guys don't

494
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,399
worry about crushing one or two of those

495
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:53,620
because if you did this correctly you're

496
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,120
gonna have at least a hundred closer to

497
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,328
five hundred if you do it like Rob and I

498
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
do

499
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:59,769
I pulled five thousand seeds from a

500
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,269
plant easy I'm looking at pulling like

501
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,399
around at least two thousand or two from

502
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,630
one plant right now I run I was running

503
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,019
seven gallon pots and hitting them with

504
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,020
big males

505
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:12,970
yeah thousands of seeds can come from

506
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:14,470
one plant where the hell were we um how

507
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,449
long to let it go what to look for you

508
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,318
can pinch that one little but you guys

509
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,730
will see what I'm talking about if

510
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,168
you've got a seeded crop and a lot of

511
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,279
times you'll see these little calyxes on

512
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,829
the bottoms of buds and they'll make you

513
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,078
think you've got a seed I didn't want to

514
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:28,839
touch one um letting them go a little

515
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,399
bit too long with the ramifications of

516
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,288
letting your seeds go too terribly long

517
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,909
yeah letting plant just basically going

518
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:35,589
to the point where hey you're gonna lose

519
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:38,850
most your teats he's gonna convert over

520
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:41,798
to CBD and things like that and then

521
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,269
secondly the progeny in the bud that's

522
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,730
actually growing oh if you've ever had

523
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:47,950
those seeds uh had a batch of seeds from

524
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,690
somebody or a reader that you've gotten

525
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,179
in and they're just hard as a rock I

526
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,679
mean they got really great dart the real

527
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,330
dark nice but I mean they're just

528
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,059
incredibly hard as rock a lot of them

529
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:59,798
have to be scored germinate yeah that's

530
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:01,119
what that's from that's a lot of it

531
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,980
basically what it is it's because

532
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,229
because the seed is this embryo and it's

533
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,579
developing a show that's developing the

534
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,529
show and the shells gonna do nothing but

535
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,629
like a bone it's gonna get harder and

536
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:12,250
harder and harder the more you pump that

537
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,590
plant and especially it comes from not

538
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,269
ripening the plant correctly also not

539
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:17,709
flushing properly things like that

540
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,119
because you got so many nutrients

541
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,250
present it's still telling it to drive

542
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,048
drive drive drive so it's gonna create

543
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,849
that and develop that and that's also

544
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:26,139
when you risk seed splitting seed

545
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:27,079
splitting will happen because whenever

546
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,549
you pull them out

547
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,898
they're gonna be so over developed that

548
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:31,129
once they start to dry out they're gonna

549
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:32,928
start cracking and splitting because

550
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,600
it's gonna be like there's gonna be such

551
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:36,890
a large embryo inside of this shell

552
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,629
because it's welled up inside of there

553
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,278
it's growing you know so you're gonna

554
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,899
have a lot of problems can develop from

555
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,278
that that's a lot of the issues when

556
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,658
people have these little issues with

557
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:45,679
seeds when they get them in the mail and

558
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,299
things like that from different breeders

559
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,278
and they are cracked and stuff but they

560
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:51,230
haven't been the package is fine and

561
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:52,490
they come great but but you got a couple

562
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,929
crack seeds in there and they look great

563
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,700
and everything but you can tell just a

564
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,048
shell split right down the side you know

565
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,429
and you're like hey this is not gonna be

566
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:01,250
good because the embryo is now dry it

567
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,509
out did so that seats toast you know and

568
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,710
then you get some day you have to score

569
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,379
because they just will not germinate

570
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,669
unless you score them let's talk about

571
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,559
that for a little bit what's the best

572
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,028
way to do you guys you'll know if the

573
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,200
seeds are super hard really thick

574
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,849
shelled you'll be able to tell by

575
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,110
looking they'll be extra glossy they'll

576
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:16,548
be a little harder than normal if

577
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:17,808
they're your first pack of seeds you

578
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:19,548
don't have anything to compare it to so

579
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,690
you're just gonna have to learn but well

580
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:22,369
it's the best way to score them to

581
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,899
soften them up a little bit to grow if

582
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,278
you got a matchbook that's real good way

583
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,079
to do if you got a matchbook use inside

584
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,519
of a matchbook just just rub like that

585
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,720
or a really fine grit sandpaper you

586
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,130
don't want to use a coarse grade because

587
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,298
it's gonna tear it it's gonna tear into

588
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,830
it right hard so you want to use a

589
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,509
really fine grit sandpaper is one of the

590
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:37,278
easiest things really to use I like to

591
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,658
just soak those plants put a little bit

592
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:41,778
of a couple drops of hydros I'm and a

593
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,010
glass of water or a jar of water either

594
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:45,109
way at the show a little bit those

595
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,480
plants 24 hours and then put them in the

596
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:48,678
paper towels

597
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,380
usually works for me another one I use

598
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,649
dr. Willard's plant catalyst okay that's

599
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,090
a good [ __ ] never talked about that on

600
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:58,729
the podcast they gave me a free bottle

601
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:00,589
of it the guy gave me a case 30 to 60

602
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,460
mils in your reservoir he said and I go

603
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,869
well how do you know how big my

604
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,120
reservoir is because it doesn't matter

605
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,408
with this you put 30 30 to 60 mils in

606
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,979
here and it'll make your plants go

607
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:11,299
faster and it did I could see them

608
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,919
side-by-side with seeds we took

609
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,538
blueberry fuel we took about ten of them

610
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,240
germinated with regular tap water and

611
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:19,339
then just sayin we germinated that the

612
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,798
same group another 10 seeds dr. which

613
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:23,028
the tap water 24 hour difference I was

614
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,069
amazed every one of those seeds

615
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:27,349
germinating within 24 hours is like nice

616
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:30,048
crazy yeah and then the regular tap

617
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:31,668
water took about 36 to 48 so it was a

618
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:33,470
dramatic difference you can see it was

619
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,210
like overnight you know versus the next

620
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,440
day it was like it was pretty wild it's

621
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,360
like that's some good stuff so we

622
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,370
squeezed it religiously so shout out to

623
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,169
dr. Willard's plant catalyst

624
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,939
if you want to send us stuff get in

625
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,580
touch grow from your heart at

626
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,549
hotmail.com we'd love to help you out be

627
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,929
cool alright so if you leave them in

628
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,849
there too long you guys your seeds will

629
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,259
start splitting so pay attention also

630
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:56,209
check it out I want to mention this this

631
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:59,058
is something that comes to mind if your

632
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,009
plants start dropping seeds if you have

633
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:03,200
more than one female in the room and

634
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,670
seeds fall out of your plant you can't

635
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,680
just pick that seat up and assume that

636
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,480
it came from this girl that could have

637
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,950
came from any of the females in the room

638
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,779
and it could have rolled to that spot so

639
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,460
you can't label that one what you think

640
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,349
it fell from you can only label seeds

641
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,299
what you're [ __ ] sure it came from

642
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:19,639
right don't ever guess when labeling a

643
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,470
seed that is the future of the cannabis

644
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,140
genome and we don't want any confusion

645
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,390
it's your job as a person breeding to

646
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,400
take beautiful notes for the future

647
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,929
let's do that for example I just had a

648
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,809
crop and we popped the seed out of it

649
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,120
earlier that goes in the happy accident

650
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:36,889
bag yes happy accidents are a good thing

651
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,659
when you're in the seed business or the

652
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,059
breeding game please don't ever make it

653
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,009
a really really great idea where I'm

654
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:45,319
almost like 90% sure where it came from

655
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,839
but I still label this so and put happy

656
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:49,909
accident yep and then I'll pop that seed

657
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,039
and it'll get a whole new name and a

658
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,090
whole new you know thing if it stays

659
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,849
around it could be the next hottest

660
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:57,439
clone only if it could be because it's

661
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:59,359
gonna go in trash a lot of the super

662
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,679
popular [ __ ] was an accident just like

663
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,240
that well that's what I try to explain

664
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,830
people it's more about selection and not

665
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,789
number you can pop a big and seeds if

666
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:06,139
you're not good at selecting those

667
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,928
plants what does the vacancy it's worth

668
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,250
yeah oh man I found some beautiful

669
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,750
keepers that most people would have

670
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,670
missed tossed I can name 10 of the

671
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,039
world's most legendary strange right now

672
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,110
that all came from five seats chem dog

673
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:21,558
really blue number four yep

674
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:24,589
Girl Scout cookies Oh Gainesville green

675
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:25,279
okay nice I don't know enough about the

676
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,230
Florida weed

677
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,319
yeah lot a lot of the most pop we we had

678
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,700
white actually did a whole episode about

679
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,279
accidents and clone only accident East

680
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,080
Coast sour dee golden goes west coast

681
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:40,308
our d OG Kush Bubba cush

682
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,049
alright so it's your job as a breeder

683
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:44,089
you guys please be careful to carefully

684
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:45,710
mark everything make sure you label

685
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,869
everything don't make any mistakes for

686
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,980
the future because you're gonna be

687
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,059
growing these seeds and hopefully some

688
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,500
of your friends are gonna be growing I

689
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:52,329
mean you don't want to mislead people on

690
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,038
what is in

691
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,538
a lot of this stuff is going to be aimed

692
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,759
at medical patients and we want the

693
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:59,140
medical patients to know the genetics of

694
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,690
what they're getting it's really helpful

695
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,970
so if you find some seeds on the floor

696
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,500
you can use them you just can't you just

697
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,669
got to be careful and carefully think

698
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,440
about what they are don't try to say

699
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,549
it's this times this until you grow it

700
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,399
and if you're certain then you could be

701
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:14,079
cool with that all right so it's gonna

702
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,339
known just label it oh no no that's not

703
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,569
necessarily a bad thing I've seen some

704
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,869
of the biggest largest breeders in the

705
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,788
world

706
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:23,678
labelled their genetics unknown crossed

707
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:26,919
with this you name it yeah it's like

708
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,720
gages number one male Joseph Joseph that

709
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,669
Joseph male that they used for years and

710
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,470
years and years and years it was it's a

711
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,970
bag seed male from somewhere and nobody

712
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,250
knows what it was so they just named it

713
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,079
Joseph ochi yeah and then they labeled

714
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,609
it properly as so and then everybody

715
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,829
knows that or we wouldn't know that you

716
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:43,089
can actually buy gages unlabeled seeds

717
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:45,398
and they've got a name I don't remember

718
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,898
what they're called but it you can buy

719
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,500
them they're all the seeds that fell to

720
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:49,599
the side

721
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,548
they're called good ideas is what his

722
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,349
extra seats are called some good ideas

723
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:56,259
they're a good idea but I don't know

724
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,788
what it's gonna be yeah alright so let's

725
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,528
get back to our little breeding project

726
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,759
here for Fred we've got plants with

727
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:03,548
seeds in them they've been pollinated

728
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,648
they've gone five and a half six ish

729
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:07,329
weeks since the pollen has hit them the

730
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:08,918
pistols are curly and brown the

731
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:11,829
trichomes are starting to Amber up the

732
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,570
plants are getting mature let's start

733
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:15,308
flushing the plants and now let's talk

734
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,019
about pulling down the plants and

735
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:20,048
getting the seeds out of these sons of

736
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:21,759
[ __ ] right on I I harvest them just

737
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:24,190
like a harvest any other regular plant I

738
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,440
take it down take away any water leaf

739
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,798
anything basically do a light wet trim

740
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,500
and then I just hang them and let them

741
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,788
dry and after one I let them dry a

742
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,710
little bit longer than normal because

743
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:37,599
they are seeded plants they have a

744
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,230
denser texture to them and they're a lot

745
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:44,678
more dense than regular so you gotta

746
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,058
really let them dry out after they're

747
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:47,490
done you know you just kind of carefully

748
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:49,599
roll them in your hands as well as

749
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,558
ideally roll them in I just let the

750
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,359
seeds fall not from a high place six

751
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:58,599
inches are lower above your table is

752
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,759
right here when you buy like a package

753
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,230
of ball jars or Kerr jars little mason

754
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,089
jars it comes with that cardboard base

755
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,589
to keep them in place I love to use that

756
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:06,129
thing or go to the liquor store and get

757
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,869
something that

758
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,460
just put cases of beer in just a little

759
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:10,989
flat one it's about you know three or

760
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,779
four inches deep and the seeds won't

761
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,980
bounce off the cardboard sorry excuse me

762
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,899
for clearing the throat so many times we

763
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,339
took so many dabs today the seeds won't

764
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,900
bounce off the cardboard I used to try

765
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:21,819
to use a cookie sheet or a pyrex dish

766
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,990
but then you take these buds that are

767
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,250
filled with seeds and they're dry and

768
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,900
you crumble them up and if you do it

769
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,960
right you guys it's gonna it's gonna

770
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,920
sound like it's raining it's gonna go to

771
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,170
dink and the seeds are gonna come

772
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,420
raining out of these buds use cardboard

773
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,860
because they will not bounce as badly as

774
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,130
they will out of a cookie sheet or a

775
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:40,689
pyrex dish so I usually just like you

776
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,340
said let the buds dry then I roll them

777
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,200
up in my hands crumble them up a little

778
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:46,569
bit where a rubber glove because you're

779
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,860
gonna get sticky as [ __ ] or don't if

780
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,389
you're into that some people like to get

781
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:51,459
that resin all over their hands our

782
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,990
friend rusty shout out to rusty he likes

783
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,630
to pick seeds without gloves and be all

784
00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:00,039
dark fingered that's me unless I'm

785
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,110
playing with Coco I'm wearing gloves I

786
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,849
like to play at the Coco barehanded that

787
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,169
Coco just cleans your hands if your

788
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,699
hands are filthy just go stick them in

789
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,460
the cocoa and mix them around your hands

790
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,049
will be shiny again it's rad alright so

791
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,759
now we've got a bunch of dried bud

792
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,829
material basically and a bunch of seeds

793
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,390
depending on the size of your garden

794
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:18,879
there's a whole bunch of different ways

795
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,100
to go and try to pull these seeds out of

796
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,570
your buds I should mention this while

797
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,939
we're here because we're all stone and

798
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:26,769
we might [ __ ] up keep your female plants

799
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,620
separate at this point like if you're

800
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:32,500
working with more than one varietal more

801
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:33,969
than one strain of females in this

802
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,650
breeding project keep the [ __ ]

803
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,519
separate because you don't want kidding

804
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,930
you don't want to get your seeds

805
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,569
confused do you want to have carefully

806
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,039
labeled seeds that's the whole part of

807
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:43,029
why your breeding is so that you can

808
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,220
know what's going on

809
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:47,109
so keep the girls separated if you find

810
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,360
seeds on the floor and the dry room once

811
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,159
again those are good ideas don't label

812
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,019
those unless you're certain of what they

813
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,519
are so now we've got all this material

814
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,650
if you've got a little crop if your

815
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,240
garden is kind of small you can simply

816
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,370
do the old-school method where you put

817
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,259
the little container at an angle and

818
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,459
slide the weed up to the top and the

819
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,619
seeds will roll to the bottom and the

820
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,480
dried weed materials stay at the top get

821
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:10,389
you a good trade good magazine whatever

822
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,009
floats your boat 45-degree angle yep get

823
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,890
back to rolling papers put on some music

824
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:15,319
and just go

825
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,880
put all those seeds in a jar and that's

826
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,829
that's lettuce you know it's the easiest

827
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,540
way to do it but if you're doing it on a

828
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:23,000
level it's where you've got a seed

829
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,230
company that's gonna get tedious really

830
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,970
quickly you and your friends can only

831
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,420
sit around for so long and you're gonna

832
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:32,779
have to give away so many packs of seeds

833
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:35,240
break in their back so they do sell a my

834
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,529
good friends at mile high seed company

835
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,029
shot at the mile high seed company they

836
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,399
showed me a device it's actually a bird

837
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:42,139
seed separator that thing is sweet you

838
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,280
before all your material yeah you put

839
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,470
your material into the top and it'll

840
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,940
hand crank on it and it just spits seeds

841
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,200
out one side and all the other material

842
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,580
falls right out of the bottom so you can

843
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,230
just put that over a bucket actually buy

844
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:52,849
a fully automatic one nowadays it

845
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,200
actually separates everything for you

846
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,169
and everything it likes to separate your

847
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,610
trim and everything from your seed so

848
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,620
you'll have it in one pile it has a nice

849
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:03,829
calm and there's and I have a clear

850
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:05,299
container below you can get them on eBay

851
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:08,119
just look up parrot seed cleaning

852
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:10,609
machine how much are they about they run

853
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,599
your price points gonna be about $159 -

854
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:13,429
Fred get bucks

855
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,709
Fred buy one it's worth it just the time

856
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:18,080
that you it's it's like trimming instant

857
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,480
trimming is fun the first seven times

858
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,529
but after once you trim ten times you

859
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,529
want to put the scissors in your hi

860
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:30,950
[Music]

861
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:34,910
parents and birds whenever you rear

862
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:36,980
Birds and in an aviary they waste about

863
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,870
75 to 80% of the food they they're

864
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,069
really picky ears so they kind of go

865
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:41,269
through the food and sit through what

866
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:44,059
they want at the time and throw the rest

867
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,500
on the ground so so basically you take

868
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,210
all your bird feed that you buy in the

869
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,549
store that's quite expensive for these

870
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,720
parrots and stuff like that and run it

871
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,730
through the machine and you get like

872
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,259
seventy seventy percent return back and

873
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:04,039
you just keep recycling so it's all gone

874
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:05,390
birds are dicks I apologize for that I'm

875
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,680
gonna blame that on this hit man or the

876
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,130
mother ship rig that we'll brought over

877

bird feeder we put all our stuff into

889
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,430
the bird feeder we pulled the seeds in

890
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,049
the material out you can smoke that

891
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,210
material or you can make hash out of

892
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:40,549
that material or you can make edibles

893
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,110
out of that material there's so many

894
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:43,819
uses for that material you guys it is

895
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:45,919
still good quality product you can roll

896
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:47,839
joints out of it smoke it I like to give

897
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,539
it to my friend will and let him make

898
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:53,119
pho at of it for me it works really well

899
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:56,149
yeah the high from it like I said

900
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,859
earlier is amazing you can also make oil

901
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,150
out of it make edibles out of it you can

902
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,169

903
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,040
anything that you would do with any

904
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:06,230
other buds out of that material so seeds

905
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,649
there is controversy online do seeds

906
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,779
need to cure I believe they do if it

907
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,580
also all depends on that's not where I

908
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:16,190
feel the controversy comes from is from

909
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,869
people that its climate it's climatic

910
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,029
yeah it's it's where the controversy

911
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:21,349
comes from okay coming from coming from

912
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:22,730
the deep swamp in the floor to the

913
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:24,379
hundred percent humidity hundred six

914
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,750
degree days every single day of the week

915
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,370
is wet though there's like soup

916
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,869
you have to cure seats for like three or

917
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:34,339
four weeks to get them just said the air

918
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:38,599
is like soup I've been to some festivals

919
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:40,339
down south and it killed me I was at a

920
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,509
festival just walking and I was covered

921
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,529
in sweat and I thought I was okay but I

922
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,150
looked around my friends like you know

923
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:45,710
what [ __ ] I'm sitting down and I'm

924
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,780
like you okay and I was like I'm cool

925
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,490
but I'm too [ __ ] hot I'm going to sit

926
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,250
down right now exactly I just needed a

927
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,710
minute just to not be so damn hot for a

928
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,230
minute yeah that's it it's real muggy in

929
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,829
the inn that's a lot of the humidity and

930
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,529
things like that

931
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:03,769
the higher the humidity the longer

932
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:04,910
you'll have to cure your seeds when one

933
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,230
of the best tricks I've learned since I

934
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,060
moved over here to Colorado takes about

935
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,880
three or four days to cure yeah and I

936
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,879
back back a four bowl two-foot long

937
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,070
t5 fixture okay and I back it off about

938
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,620
two to three feet off a pan and I let

939
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:20,210
and all the UV rays and everything cured

940
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:23,889
the seeds in about three days and that's

941
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,890
where they jump right out and see okay

942
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,759
they want to fly right out and then

943
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,709
we've all of our testers came back 100%

944
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,140
germination very cool I mean hundreds

945
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,579
and hundreds of seeds nice I mean it was

946
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,380
just like that was a good thing and

947
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:38,699
there's also a few dry ice methods are

948
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,920
you looking for any testers

949
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,660
always always looking for good testers

950
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,000
is willing to put in the effort and

951
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,000
throw back the result that sits that's

952
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,410
what we're always looking for let's uh

953
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,089
when a lot of people hit me up to be a

954
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,790
tester I'm sure people hit you up let's

955
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:55,619
just give these guys an idea of who is a

956
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:57,149
qualified tester so that we don't have

957
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,859
to keep typing these emails that's right

958
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,420
well I'm looking for I'm looking for at

959
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,539
least minimum three to five years

960
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,830
experience I want you to pretty much

961
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,389
have already run through every book

962
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,919
there is on the planet that you can get

963
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,240
your hands on the resource material

964
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,160
that's out there because you're given

965
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,660
all this free resource material nowadays

966
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,480
especially with the internet and things

967
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:18,150
like that that there's no really excuse

968
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,890
for you not to educate yourself you have

969
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,630
it right in front of your face to

970
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,400
educate yourself that's that's the first

971
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,930
number one thing I can tell any growers

972
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,370
educate yourself and that's gonna make

973
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,720
you a better girl or everybody always I

974
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,919
have what can I do to make my plants

975
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,539
better what can I do to learn this to

976
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,350
educate yourself that's the best thing

977
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,569
you can do yeah

978
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:35,429
nobody's gonna do it for you this is the

979
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:37,769
real world it's just the way it is it

980
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,539
sucks but it'll make you better and you

981
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:42,000
know this is the way the none of us

982
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,230
learn the easy way you know no one held

983
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,529
our hand through it or anything like

984
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,549
that

985
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:49,079
Ruth is what you have to do it in and

986
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,720
then from there you know just did that

987

two lights that you can fully dedicate

994
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,969
to the seeds that I'm going to send you

995
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,230
at least one light for the ten pack of

996
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,960
seeds that you're gonna get for free I

997
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,910
want one light of your space I want you

998
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,860
to be able to make a diary of what

999
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,660
you're how you're growing how many of

1000
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:29,009
the seeds I sent you germinated how many

1001
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,490
of them were females how many were

1002
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:34,980
hermaphrodites how long did it take to

1003
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,049
see sex how long did it take you to find

1004
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,789
the hermaphrodite how many of those

1005
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,039
plants were male and female out of those

1006
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:43,079
females how many were keepers how many

1007
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,119
would you run again would you run this

1008
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,500
strain again do you have the ability to

1009
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,750
get this plant tested for THC CBD THC

1010
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,329
THC eight each

1011
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,410
viii CBG do you have testing

1012
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:57,169
capabilities

1013
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,960
do you have these testing abilities how

1014
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,910
was the flavor how was the high like was

1015
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,039
it worth the [ __ ] at all how long did it

1016
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,690
take the flower we want that kind of

1017
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,849
notes and then we want you to get a

1018
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,200
camera if it's your iPhone that's red if

1019
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,059
you've got a better camera we want you

1020
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,878
to get a good camera and I want pictures

1021
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:16,128
at least once a week of each phenotype

1022
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,980
carefully labeled with the week number

1023
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:20,509
the strain name and the phenotype number

1024
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,070
that you have selected for that well we

1025
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,780
can't stand in the industry as the guy

1026
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,370
that we give twenty seats to that pops

1027
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,810
three seeds and it takes six months to

1028
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:29,359
get report back on those three seeds

1029
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:31,369
yeah I'm trying to cannot stand that

1030
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,419
more than anything if you're that guy

1031
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,648
you suck guy I've been that guy before

1032
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,559
because our friend

1033
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:43,969
I gave green genetics sent me about

1034
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:46,969
7,000 packs I'm like I only have so much

1035
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:49,849
which one I can only pull over so far

1036
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:51,259
yeah gage really helped myself out in

1037
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:54,019
the cannabis industry helping me get

1038
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,909
where I am so shot at the gage screen so

1039
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:58,849
let's tell them why it's so frustrating

1040
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,829
when I send you testers it's because I'm

1041
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,659
trying to release a new product line and

1042
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:04,429
I want to get research done on that so

1043
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:06,109
that I don't put out seeds that are [ __ ]

1044
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:09,049
because I don't want to put them

1045
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,610
available at the dank team.com and then

1046
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,400
you spend money on them and then they

1047
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,440
totally suck so I send out to my testing

1048
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,170
team I send out quite a large batch of

1049
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,510
test seeds I've sent out entire first

1050
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,700
runs of test batches like this first

1051
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,860
breeding project I kept like 250 of them

1052
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:26,359
and then sent [ __ ] a thousand seeds

1053
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,740
out to other people to run and then if

1054
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,720
it's worth of [ __ ] I'll make more that's

1055
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,639
right and I always find you the easiest

1056
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:33,319
way to select the best phenotype out of

1057
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,000
a thousand seeds is to have a bunch of

1058
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,490
really good testers yeah and stay in

1059
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,380
contact with amido and keep up with them

1060
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:40,819
and have them keep up with you and then

1061
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,019
that way whenever it comes down to it

1062
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,250
you're like hey you know well here's

1063
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:44,840
something that you don't have for doing

1064
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,489
all that work you know and give them a

1065
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,559
little trade off or something finding it

1066
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,939
for ya you find keepers and things like

1067
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,230
that you find test results that you

1068
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,909
don't find other places that's how I

1069
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,920
know personally like a lot of Rusty's

1070
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:56,509
and candidatures cuts and things like

1071
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,670
that were found that's how our blueberry

1072
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,980
fuel was found at over 500 seeds and

1073
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,320
three years later it was it came out of

1074
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,338
Boston and ended up out of Boston that's

1075
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,200
my boy William

1076
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:07,788
yeah I've got a friend who's doing a

1077
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,228
really good job with Capleton and I'm

1078
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,880
waiting for a cut of that and then I've

1079
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:13,848
got a friend who can't be mentioned

1080
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,400
who's got a really good cut of the blue

1081
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:23,359
heeler today which has some little bit

1082
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:26,809
of blue dream in there hashtag the fix

1083
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,369
is trying to fix the blue dream editor

1084
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,680
pains to it there wasn't presently there

1085
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:33,920
just it does really well with OG Terps

1086
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:36,108
we found because it's already got some

1087
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,579
Myra scene present and some other things

1088
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:39,469
that you'd normally don't typically find

1089
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:42,019
and sativas but you can't really taste

1090
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:44,059
it in the blue dream so why not give it

1091
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:45,409
that extra kick in a do things that

1092
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:48,579
aren't normally they're different

1093
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,578
structures and the shorter flower a

1094
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:56,018
really nice structure to it that's what

1095
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,338
you need that's what you need nowadays

1096
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:59,899
it is a great parent that that's that's

1097
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:01,728
really where it's where it lies that

1098
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,460
anymore I don't think it has a place on

1099
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:06,348
the top shelf market anymore and but

1100
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,298
potage breeders I still think it's still

1101
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,369
going to these days cuz it is so stable

1102
00:37:08,298 --> 00:37:13,159
yeah but I'll give it that you know that

1103
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,719
sets word that's why it's close to me

1104
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,920
just in my hour this is because it's

1105
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,108
always been a great breeder you can hate

1106
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,659
it with anything Rafa did Akane's and

1107
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:23,239
it's gonna come out great I've done it

1108
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:25,578
and had happy accidents and great ideas

1109
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,318
don't encourage anybody to no no don't

1110
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,539
do that on purpose definitely don't do

1111
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:30,949
that on purpose I'm gonna back up and

1112
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,170
something we didn't talk about if you're

1113
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:36,169
making feminized seeds you need to get

1114
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,479
that mail going way early ah three weeks

1115
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,608
ahead of time if you're trying to get

1116
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:42,768
your female plants ready to flower at

1117
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:44,900
week three you want to get those males

1118
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:48,649
if you want to start spraying them in

1119
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:51,469
veg spray and veg for a week and then

1120
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,059
flower them almost six weeks ahead of

1121
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,639
those girl plants you want to get them a

1122
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:57,200
nice fat head start reversing a plant

1123
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:00,170
takes a lot of time it takes a lot of

1124
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,460
energy you need to stifle the copper

1125
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,739
movement in the plant by hitting it with

1126
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,409
the silver thiosulfate the plant needs

1127
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:08,269
to react needs to learn what to do with

1128
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,818
that reaction it needs to change its

1129
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:12,738
hormones to create create pollen then it

1130
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:14,960
needs to develop the sacks to create

1131
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:16,940
pollen then it will release pollen it's

1132
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,720
gonna take a long time if you're making

1133
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,700
your first

1134
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:23,059
first meal you're gonna be like I did it

1135
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:24,769
wrong you just got to spray it more and

1136
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:26,210
more and more and more yet don't even

1137
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,980
waste time with collodial silver make

1138
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,090
your own silver thighs okay that was

1139
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,800
really good

1140
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,030
since all these new growers are coming

1141
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,560
on the scene people are trying to create

1142
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,269
their new strain to stuff the colloidal

1143
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,159
silver hype is coming back stronger than

1144
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:40,809
ever it was around about ten years ago

1145
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,809
and now it's back like bell-bottoms man

1146
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,440
it doesn't block the gene well enough

1147
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,659
and for long enough and hard enough

1148
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,269
strong enough to not create a higher

1149
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:52,779
ratio hermaphrodite problems don't do it

1150
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:54,829
use STS it's it's properly you haven't

1151
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,780
in the long run it's cheaper it's

1152
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,519
cheaper oh it's so much cheaper I have

1153
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,680
to throw it away cuz I make too large of

1154
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,690
a batch at one time that's a throw that

1155
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:04,879
to get away and it's it's dirt cheap

1156
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:09,380
once you buy your first batch I've got

1157
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,970
some from two years ago you use I think

1158
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,680
you buy a one ounce in a three ounce jar

1159
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:13,309
and I think you use like three grams and

1160
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,719
two grams

1161
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:18,829
out of each star for your first mash

1162
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:22,009
this big yeah exactly and you can store

1163
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:23,598
that jar for it's like 4050 it's in the

1164
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:28,460
fridge right next door to the to the

1165
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,410
pollen that we store in there if you're

1166
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,240
gonna make silver thiosulfate Spray one

1167
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:35,179
way to keep it around longer when you

1168
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,919
mix the two components into these

1169
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:38,629
separate containers of water keep them

1170
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,909
separate don't mix them and they'll

1171
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,640
store longer right yeah and I also never

1172
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:46,159
spray my STS under light right I always

1173
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,750
take it out spray it in darkness till it

1174
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,639
just dripping off I try to get the other

1175
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,920
sides of the leaves to stalk the stops

1176
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,779
are important yeah it's press box yeah

1177
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,369
and then let it dry out really good

1178
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,510
maybe even with a little fans I'd and

1179
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:58,039
let it dry out real good make sure

1180
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,320
everything's dry otherwise you will get

1181
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,400
burn marks and then and if you put it

1182
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,630
back in a room with some girls that

1183
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,369
you're not trying to flip you'll have

1184
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,750
some [ __ ] in there that's ER yeah

1185
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,880
you'll make some some Caitlyn Jenner

1186
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,320
Caitlyn Jenner oh there's a little bit

1187
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,450
of rub here a little bit of rub there

1188
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,070
the last TS here the last yes there it

1189
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:15,618
happens yeah you learn from experience

1190
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,990
you learn plants are gonna take a whole

1191
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:20,030
bunch of spring summer knock that's it

1192
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:21,559
and some are gonna burn from it and it's

1193
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,849
okay if the leaves curl up and look

1194
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,500
pissed off as long as you still have

1195
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:25,250
enough of that plant to create pollen

1196
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,199
you're gonna be alright

1197
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,420
it's that male plant is gonna look like

1198
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,849
[ __ ] after that silver thiosulfate spray

1199
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,530
and as people really need

1200
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,329
stand to about reversing plants you not

1201
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,620
I've had somebody coming to my grow and

1202
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:37,059
say oh you have a hermie plant was like

1203
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,569
no it's a reverse plant look at me go

1204
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,920
huh

1205
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,660
and they just look at me you know with

1206
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,559
the most baffled look on their face and

1207
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,849
they don't understand what I'm talking

1208
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,110
about average plant is totally different

1209
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,610
than our magnetic plant

1210
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,200
yeah we did this on purpose we did this

1211
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,970
on purpose and we're blocking genes

1212
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,669
we're actually blocking genes in the

1213
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:53,709
genome whereas our Meredydd ik is like

1214
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,900
that because of its genome so the silver

1215
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,309
the silver hits the plant and it can't

1216
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,019
move by itself so the thiosulfate

1217
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:00,820
solution makes it mobile and absorbable

1218
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:02,230
within the plant and that blocks the

1219
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,300
copper production in the plant the

1220
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,159
copper movement in the plant which

1221
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:10,120
triggers an ethylene responses at ethyl

1222
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:13,269
or ethylene [ __ ] either way come on help

1223
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,130
me out it triggers a response of ethyl

1224
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:17,170
or ethylene I'm gonna say ethyl because

1225
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,019
ethylene sounds like more of a gap like

1226
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,860
it was like I'm making methylamine you

1227
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:24,340
thinking ethanol

1228
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,690
okay well either way it it messes up it

1229
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,370
triggers that hormone and that hormone

1230
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,230
is what tells the plant that it wants to

1231
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:30,940
change sexes and start producing pollens

1232
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,130
then you make pollen that since this

1233
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,170
plant has no male chromosomes it will

1234
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,970
not donate any male chromosomes to the

1235
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:39,010
breeding project it'll all be female

1236
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:41,589
chromosomes so basically three take you

1237
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,480
back to its mother's yeah that's it

1238
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,490
that's the mother of the plant that's

1239
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,980
it's pretty much what it is if you have

1240
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:49,659
a 50/50 hybrid that's what you can

1241
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,300
expect it to lean toward that mother's

1242
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:55,719
side and then it's ideal

1243
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,769
once you find beekeeper if and I didn't

1244
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,119
realize not a lot of people were doing

1245
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,730
this when I started breeding I was

1246
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,949
reversing a female to a male and hitting

1247
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,199
several females so I was making nine or

1248
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:07,239
ten feminized crosses at one time and

1249
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,919
then I realized later that that's not

1250
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,349
industry-standard of how that's done

1251
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,690
most of the time people will take a

1252
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:15,219
clone only or their favorite plant and

1253
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,260
reverse that and hit it with a bunch of

1254
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:18,759
the hit bat pollen on the same bunch of

1255
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,880
the same clones and just keep doing it

1256
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,620
I've actually been reverse reversing

1257
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,940
plants and true breeding with those

1258
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:27,670
reversed plants and I didn't even

1259
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,039
realize how far out of the norm I was

1260
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,110
stepping most folks would find a keeper

1261
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:34,329
and then keep reversing that one to keep

1262
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,660
making more and more and more but I've

1263
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:39,670
actually I reversed the plant pollinated

1264
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,679
another plant of the the clone of the

1265
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,809
same strain made seedlings of that took

1266
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,419
seeds of that took that original plant I

1267
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:46,869
reversed

1268
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,670
the pollen on that one and after a few

1269
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:51,739
finial generations of inbreeding I was

1270
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,590
unable to reverse the plant with silver

1271
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:56,869
thiosulfate I bred it so so strong that

1272
00:42:54,590 --> 00:43:00,800
it's so female it will not reverse on me

1273
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:02,929
it was a grateful dog experiment and I

1274
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,200
called it GD 77 is the one that will not

1275
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:10,389
reverse yeah

1276
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:14,539
1977 is my favorite is why it got Gd 77

1277
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:16,879
random breeder [ __ ] right there yeah

1278
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,139
right I have another rant I want to kind

1279
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,390
of go on but I don't know my piss people

1280
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:23,179
off it frustrates me when hash makers

1281
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,500
put two different strains in a tube and

1282
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:28,399
run it together and think that they can

1283
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,079
now call it I'm like no that took you

1284
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,610
seven minutes like it takes me [ __ ]

1285
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,319
years to develop something that I get to

1286
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,480
name you don't get to name it

1287
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,580
you don't get to name something who

1288
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,289
expressed because you could Doctor Who

1289
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:41,329
and pineapple Express and a [ __ ]

1290
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:43,699
container together I'm half serious I'm

1291
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:46,759
half frustrated half don't care like I

1292
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:48,439
think it's it's misleading to the

1293
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,730
medical patients because it's hard for

1294
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,700
them to know what strains yeah no I'm

1295
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,380
like the but I know I know that this is

1296
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,669
Doctor Who and probably pineapple

1297
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,280
Express because I've been in this long

1298
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,809
enough but it's called who express a lot

1299
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,220
of if you're a medical patient and

1300
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,480
you're not hip and paying attention on

1301
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:04,339
Instagram you don't know what the [ __ ]

1302
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,260
that is and maybe doctor who's your

1303
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,140
favorite but maybe pineapple Express can

1304
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:19,940
be panic attacks and maybe there is be

1305
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:23,599
like ogee and the really 50/50 blend

1306
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,039
there is right and I'm not trying to be

1307
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,360
a hater on that I just think that that's

1308
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,860
a little bit misleading I know we've

1309
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,210
come to the point technology is just

1310
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,860
cannabis industry where we're supposed

1311
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,269
to be stepping it up here in Colorado

1312
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,789
and everything else you know we're the

1313
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:36,739
guys that are these guys sitting at this

1314
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:38,389
table right now you know among other

1315
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:40,159
growers here in Colorado are the ones

1316
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:41,059
that are sitting the forefront for all

1317
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,099
the other states because they're all

1318
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:44,719
looking at this day going how do we do

1319
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:47,179
this you know and they're falling in

1320
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,099
line you know models that's it we're

1321
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:50,480
taking the lead and then you know

1322
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,150
started ever since I've been in Colorado

1323
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,579
and proud to be a part of that you know

1324
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,240
this particular company will only accept

1325
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,429
one

1326
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,779
thousand gram runs so I understand the

1327
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,190
need to make [ __ ] because you're gonna

1328
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,260
if you've got a pound of this and a

1329
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,950
pound of this then you got a thousand

1330
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,780
gram run but yeah a lot of trim exactly

1331
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:10,009
and they make they make a great product

1332
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,200
I'm not gonna say their name or anything

1333
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,550
cuz I kind of just talk [ __ ] but they do

1334
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:15,589
make a great product I just find it

1335
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,390
frustrating and misleading almost to the

1336
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,250
market it's no I mean you're not really

1337
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,829
talking to you just giving them you know

1338
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,300
that's effective criticism yeah it's all

1339
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:24,380
that is I mean if they can't you know

1340
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,300
label it and you should they should

1341
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,090
label it is so you know I mean then that

1342
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,789
makes them that much better exactly you

1343
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,230
know that that's no disrespect to the

1344
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:39,769
people that are forced to combine

1345
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:41,000
batches because metric makes you just

1346
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,860
wish it didn't have to be that way

1347
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,599
because there's a bleeder I get to take

1348
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,930
grateful dog and Girl Scout cookies and

1349
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,239
put it together and call it doggy style

1350
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:51,500
people do that to hash and I don't feel

1351
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,899
like I don't know they just grab two

1352
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,940
tubes and mix my trim together and now

1353
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,860
they just made a new strain no I can't

1354
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:05,960
use the name that they just took is now

1355
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:07,340
everyone's yeah I like that

1356
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,230
I like how you labeled that I wish I

1357
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,230
could say their names out loud my kids

1358
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,639
are still sitting at this table right

1359
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,350
now all right so we've gotten to the

1360
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,210
point where we're pulling seeds out of

1361
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,529
the bud we're curing buds that's where

1362
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,240
we are I try to keep tabs on where we

1363
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,860
are I don't even have any notebook paper

1364
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:29,479
and I can still do a podcast and kind of

1365
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,340
proud of myself all right we got to cure

1366
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,929
him you say that here in Colorado we've

1367
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,280
got I only got a cure for like three or

1368
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:36,319
four days I agree with that I didn't

1369
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,500
realize that in the swamp in the South

1370
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:43,970
that you had [ __ ] soup for air a lot

1371
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,309
more secure time my theory was that the

1372
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,750
seeds finish in the buds in nature the

1373
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:49,610
seeds would finish in the buds the buds

1374
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,690
would kind of dry up and die and they

1375
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,099
would fall into the ground and they

1376
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,900
would sit in the ground all winter and

1377
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:56,360
that would be their natural cure time

1378
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,860
which is part of why I keep my seeds and

1379
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,200
a cooler because I think that nature

1380
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,970
would keep them in the snow maybe

1381
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:03,919
depending on where they are maybe cold

1382
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:05,209
rain and then that's what's also going

1383
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,559
to germinate them the rains are gonna

1384
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,789
come and germinate them in this spring

1385
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,739
and then they're gonna start popping up

1386
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,150
so it's a I just

1387
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:13,699
figured they would kind of be curing in

1388
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,769
the plant in nature yeah they've

1389
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,239
actually been they've been domesticated

1390
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:19,099
to the point now where there's only like

1391
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,659
there's only certain regions of the

1392
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:22,190
world just comes like a handful of

1393
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:23,868
places in the world that we Texaco just

1394
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,690
completely naturally like actual weed

1395
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:28,820
not him yeah actual cannabis that it

1396
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,559
grows naturally you know you know West

1397
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,880
Himalayan mountains places like that I'd

1398
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,949
love to go up there where I've seen

1399
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,030
Arjen and his crew go up in smoke some

1400
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:40,159
of that house full of a lot of old like

1401
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,080
Malawi in places like that there's just

1402
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,940
full of old land race genetics that are

1403
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,319
falling and dying and same crops coming

1404
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,090
over and over and over again every year

1405
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,619
in the same spot those are heirloom

1406
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,420
genetics we're gonna keep talking about

1407
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,160
seeds but I've got another random note

1408
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,210
that I want to interrupt because I've

1409
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:54,829
got some grown people here that are

1410
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,440
great to have cannabis conversation with

1411
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:59,000
have you guys seen our Ian from

1412
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,280
greenhouse seeds are Ian and Franco and

1413
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,690
Simon travel all around the world and

1414
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,880
they go to these places where they're

1415
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,260
growing landrace genetics and they check

1416
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,030
it out and they ask the farmers for

1417
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,950
seeds and the farmers happily will give

1418
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,450
them a bag of seeds your seeds right

1419
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:14,299
soon as they've seen quite a few of them

1420
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:16,460
are Ian then in return hands them packs

1421
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,590
of his coloured greenhouse seeds because

1422
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,358
his seeds are rolled in coloured coding

1423
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,680
because then he can tell what strain

1424
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:23,840
they are without having them in

1425
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,699
packaging yeah there was some candy

1426
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,200
coating that has also worked as a

1427
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,409
fertiliser it helps your plants in

1428
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:33,409
Germany so he trades them these

1429
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:36,500
oftentimes feminized seeds do you guys

1430
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:38,629
feel that he is [ __ ] up the landrace

1431
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,010
genetics in these places by adulterating

1432
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,108
them with his seeds

1433
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,910
I guess if they're planning I'm like

1434
00:48:42,108 --> 00:48:45,920
right out there with their land races

1435
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:48,730
and their cross pollinating and I guess

1436
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,539
he just keep dying and regrowing and uh

1437
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:53,240
eventually I guess it's gonna be a

1438
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:55,608
different yeah did those [ __ ] of the

1439
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:57,259
heirloom line but at the same time I've

1440
00:48:55,608 --> 00:48:58,730
seen a lot of those heirloom genetics

1441
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,700
and stuff like that and nothing really

1442
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,960
brag home about they look like some

1443
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,000
straight slag and they're finished

1444
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,920
drying there's really nothing to him so

1445
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,929
the Heinz Heinz fifty-fifty you know I

1446
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,139
mean he's gonna bring a better yielding

1447
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:13,849
strains to places like you know Africa

1448
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:15,469
and places like that but it was in

1449
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:18,659
Jamaica is where actually saw him do

1450
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:21,480
this yeah but like you're saying

1451
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:23,339
it does is it's a it's kind of at what

1452
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,869
cost kind of thing right it's it's it's

1453
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,940
like yeah you're gonna you're gonna give

1454
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,829
them better genetics for their future

1455
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,030
and you know and their kids and their

1456
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:31,529
kids and their kids are gonna have

1457
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,790
better yielding better plants and stuff

1458
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,050
like that which is gonna give more

1459
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:35,070
profits for them so they're gonna be

1460
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,289
able to yield more food for their

1461
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,360
families and things like that but at the

1462
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:40,469
same time you know like you said you're

1463
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,990
gonna come and you're gonna completely

1464
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:44,039
disaster eyes those heirlooms which you

1465
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,989
know there's thousands of generations

1466
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,829
yeah people you know they've been doing

1467
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:52,079
the same thing it's history but change

1468
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:56,579
is inevitable all right I like it I'm

1469
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,230
torn on the subject 50/50 at everything

1470
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,940
because life is a carburetor it's gonna

1471
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,139
have good and bad to it like will said

1472
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:08,789
someone's gonna get in there at some

1473
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:10,799
point is something at some point because

1474
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:14,429
been somebody's Mexican weed from

1475
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,680
Florida green seeds white widows so I

1476
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:22,909
guess with green house seeds isn't so

1477
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:25,409
bad all right so now the seeds are cured

1478
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:28,399
we've got a big-ass bag or maybe a

1479
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:32,519
smaller portion of dried and cured seeds

1480
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,889
how do we store them um again you can

1481
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:36,690
use dried rice but I like to do a steel

1482
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:38,219
silicon packets out of electronics and

1483
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,860
things and things I get in the mail so

1484
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,059
you keep all those yeah the silicon

1485
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:47,809
packs that you get like when you buy a

1486
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:50,489
new computer or exactly you take those I

1487
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:52,650
collect all those I'm here in Colorado

1488
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:55,019
it's pretty dry so I just grab thumb and

1489
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,519
freezers soon as freezer refrigerator as

1490
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,509
soon as possible to keep moisture away

1491
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:59,460
from them all right

1492
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,630
that way they prolong the life I mean

1493
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,860
kind of tell when they're good when

1494
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,869
they're bad it's a nice and good and

1495
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,400
clear color they're good if they turned

1496
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:07,319
like a dark or an amber color or a dark

1497
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,760
brown color they're no longer useful

1498
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,080
they've actually pulled moisture and

1499
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,700
bacteria and things out of the air which

1500
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,829
gave them that color the oxidized yeah

1501
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,299
yeah so all right so they're no longer

1502
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:16,469
good that's one good way to find out

1503
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,860
wouldn't you know crack it open take a

1504
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:18,480
look

1505
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,220
I always crack them up and put them all

1506
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,050
in a big jar and actually give them in

1507
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:24,059
my seed packages actually in our vials

1508
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,740
we do a layer of beads do we do a late

1509
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:27,239
and then we do a layer of cotton then

1510
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:30,149
the seats and the Cotton's and the beads

1511
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,099
that way it's like a thirty-year storage

1512
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,430
file nice you know you can throw that in

1513
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,409
your fridge

1514
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:37,079
thirty years and pull it out pop those

1515
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,199
seeds that's impressive

1516
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,460
yeah it's simply I have to up my game

1517
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,230
simple but effective because we got the

1518
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,329
unit we got the mylar packaging which in

1519
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,889
itself is a food saving package yeah and

1520
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:48,750
then we had the vial inside and then we

1521
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:50,219
use those beets a lot of the time

1522
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,840
growers would get them if you don't get

1523
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:53,579
them that's because we didn't have any

1524
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,110
to get right at the moment but either

1525
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,639
way you still get the cotton into the

1526
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,079
vial and everything else like that but

1527
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,069
typically we always put beads in there

1528
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,539
with them and people have asked me

1529
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:02,400
what's that for testers have asked me

1530
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:03,989
what are these beads for you know the

1531
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:10,650
seeds in there I've had one guy ask me

1532
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:13,859
about the seeds in there you know it

1533
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:16,019
also throws them off looking for things

1534
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,390
like that that's helpful but yeah and

1535
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:19,650
fruit frigerator store not freezer I

1536
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,079
would say you don't want you don't want

1537
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,880
to freeze it because once you get below

1538
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,549
freezing point you're basically the

1539
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,440
water inside of the embryo is trying to

1540
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,640
expand right you'll have more cracks

1541
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,170
that's basically you're basically

1542
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:32,819
creating in large earthquake inside of

1543
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:36,090
your embryo because it's trying to

1544
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,530
expand and crack outwards and it has

1545
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,300
nowhere else to go it's it's it's

1546
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,010
isolated and that shows all the water in

1547
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,350
there's gonna crack and expand that that

1548
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:45,330
that embryo and destroy it so you really

1549
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:47,849
want to say anything above freezing

1550
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,840
temperature 32 degrees all right but now

1551
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:50,159
here's my favorite part

1552
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,380
once you've got a whole bunch of seeds

1553
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,549
you've got your herbs separated do

1554
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,200
something with that herb we're gonna

1555
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,269
move on to talk about seeds my favorite

1556
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,129
part grow a bunch of the things that's

1557
00:52:57,269 --> 00:53:00,449
right get as many as you can that's

1558
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,940
right and figure out how much space

1559
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:05,669
you've got and then grow plant more

1560
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,590
seeds than that even if you're not a

1561
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,090
large-scale breeder and you have 500

1562
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,340
seats you know give them to your friends

1563
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,900
do your own testing you know that's the

1564
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:15,240
way to do it you know the guys like me

1565
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,889
give me the guys like we'll take some

1566
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,539
will grow we're not afraid you might

1567
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:20,639
have some amazing [ __ ] that's right

1568
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:22,289
we'll go 10 of them for you I got some

1569
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,289
in from California called silver widow

1570
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:27,690
and it's a super Silver Haze white widow

1571
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:29,420
cross hole that's gonna take 12 days to

1572
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,690
finish

1573
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,950
some of the pictures look great and you

1574
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,720
know there's some good phenotypes I know

1575
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:37,669
that are there there there you have to

1576
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:39,469
find them but oh yeah it's a search yeah

1577
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,730
it's it's a search you know you just in

1578
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:42,379
if there's nothing there then we throw

1579
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,809
them in the trash can that's just how it

1580
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,420
works afterwards we smoke it and blast

1581
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:49,460
it whatever we do and you know it goes

1582
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,900
go on to the next project you know you

1583
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,970
got to have a passion for doing what you

1584
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,980
do and that's a lot of it too that's

1585
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:57,528
another thing we looking for testers

1586
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,690
that's passion passion that's how many

1587
00:53:57,528 --> 00:54:01,099
young people dedicated to what they do

1588
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,659
just because they do it anyway

1589
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,579
and what percentage of your breeding

1590
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:06,379
project gets totally scrapped so you

1591
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,970
breed you may exceed you take a few of

1592
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,338
those seeds you grow out so many of them

1593
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:12,139
and then you go uh how many times have

1594
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:13,248
you just completely flushed a bag of

1595
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,170
seeds down the toilet because the

1596
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:16,879
project wasn't worth a [ __ ] I'd say at

1597
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:19,818
least thirty forty percent of the time

1598
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,588
that's a good breeder right there I just

1599
00:54:19,818 --> 00:54:23,268
actually went through my box like two

1600
00:54:21,588 --> 00:54:31,788
weeks ago man this threw away like

1601
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:33,528
handfuls and just tossing it as a

1602
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:35,660
breeder it's important that you don't

1603
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:38,028
get your ego stuck on a strain you might

1604
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:39,828
really think that this cross you've got

1605
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:42,588
and this mail you've got is gonna make

1606
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:44,359
the next [ __ ] hype and if it doesn't

1607
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:45,768
don't be afraid to throw it away go

1608
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,598
ahead and toss it we don't want those

1609
00:54:45,768 --> 00:54:49,608
shitty seeds out on the market you can

1610
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,048
breed again you can make something way

1611
00:54:49,608 --> 00:54:52,159
better and then you're not gonna be

1612
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:53,989
known as that guy that made that

1613
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,879
hermaphroditic weak [ __ ] you might be

1614
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:57,829
that guy that made that next flame you

1615
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,180
never know and we want to know we want

1616
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:00,650
to know if you got problems with the

1617
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:02,118
seeds we want to know if you'd do great

1618
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,559
garden and you're automatically having

1619
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:05,769
her a frenetic problems and things like

1620
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:07,730
that well ya know these things you know

1621
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:09,169
some breeders don't want to know what

1622
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,838
some breeders are too big to give a [ __ ]

1623
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,430
but you know we're not those guys you

1624
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,018
know that's that's it I know that for a

1625
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:16,879
fact that and we're always down to

1626
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:18,709
answer questions and that's why we're

1627
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,150
here right now yeah well thanks for

1628
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,318
coming for a few man appreciated uh what

1629
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,700
else do you think we should cover we got

1630
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,139
all the way down to growing them give

1631
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:25,879
them out to your friends start to finish

1632
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:27,889
grow them that's that's the next step

1633
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,079
take careful notes and finally keepers

1634
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:31,518
give me your friends to grow you know ha

1635
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,140
then make F twos

1636
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:35,988
because f2 is where [ __ ] gets really fun

1637
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:38,690
oh you know then you get a recessive

1638
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:40,400
segregation transgressive segregation

1639
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:42,019
yeah that's a transgressive segregation

1640
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,798
that's where your offspring will show

1641
00:55:42,018 --> 00:55:44,928
better traits

1642
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,329
then it's parents will outperform each

1643
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:48,769
parent so yeah cool [ __ ] don't believe

1644
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:50,150
and don't believe in too much hype that

1645
00:55:48,768 --> 00:55:51,649
you hear on things either try it for

1646
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,389
yourself and make your own determination

1647
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,039
true yeah don't be afraid to get in

1648
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:56,748
there and close ahead I've had F six

1649
00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:02,809
lavenders from someone everyone on was

1650
00:55:56,748 --> 00:56:04,698
her me Wow so so you know you really

1651
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:06,979
would you attribute that into the way

1652
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:09,438
that he makes his pollen sometimes I he

1653
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:11,808
does and then he also does a lot of rot

1654
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:13,368
ization I know that for a fact

1655
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,839
he's written articles on it I've read

1656
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,369
from him that he's done a lot of rebel

1657
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,619
ization which is basically taking a

1658
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:19,939
plant past its harvest point to the

1659
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:22,009
point where it's creating a female

1660
00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:23,808
banana then harvesting a female banana

1661
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:27,458
which basically is hermaphroditic banana

1662
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:30,619
yep and he also will light a fire and

1663
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:32,239
almost put the plant on fire so it goes

1664
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:33,769
into a panic mode and that panic mode

1665
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,409
makes it do the same thing it makes it

1666
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:39,278
spit out her flowers have her pollen and

1667
00:56:36,409 --> 00:56:43,248
also do a light stress yeah yeah

1668
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:45,139
old-school funky ship it too so he's a

1669
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:46,488
lot of grief no no yeah someone who

1670
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:48,078
strange some of the greatest ones and

1671
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:49,789
still this Taylor lavender I mentioned

1672
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,380
that that's a legendary strain and when

1673
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:54,079
you get good phenotypes at them they

1674
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:56,119
taste amazing it's so Gouda man they did

1675
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,999
some best concentrates that lavender is

1676
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:00,829
on point you know but these old-school

1677
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,328
strains that someone was one of the guys

1678
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:03,890
if it wasn't for him that the New York

1679
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:07,309
City diesel really wouldn't be as hot

1680
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:10,219
today as it is I really liked his oh man

1681
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:12,170
the g13 hazed there's a g13 haze that I

1682
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:14,358
picked up a while back from soma that

1683
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,818
was amazing I loved the flavor of that

1684
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:18,798
stuff still Hidden Mist but when you

1685
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:19,880
find the good keepers their keepers you

1686
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:21,318
know what I'm saying their keepers but

1687
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,789
you got a lot of run a lot of his gear

1688
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:24,829
to find those keepers he reminds me like

1689
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:27,549
DJ shorts the same way and that's

1690
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:33,769
nothing against DJ butt and you know

1691
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:35,538
quit breeding go eat specifically for

1692
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:38,748
what he wants right give a [ __ ] about

1693
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:40,249
the TV lover TV lover and that's what he

1694
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:42,618
breeds and that's his thing you know but

1695
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:44,629
he has to understand you know there's he

1696
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:47,858
he does pay for a lot of his advertising

1697
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:47,858
because great advertisement

1698
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:53,629
his book is definitely good he's a great

1699
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,740
breeder he's a great grower and things

1700
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:57,390
like that just not my forte and

1701
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:58,919
you know it's the same thing with him

1702
00:57:57,389 --> 00:58:01,289
you have to run a hundred seeds to get a

1703
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,950
good phenotype you know we're size I can

1704
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:06,929
generally say I know you gauge me can

1705
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:09,419
adventure quite a few others in this

1706
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:12,109
game I'll hi I've had 10 packs and found

1707
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:15,750
three keepers out of heat rare dankness

1708
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:17,460
those receivers you know I've gotten

1709
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:21,659
some really wonky plants from arid

1710
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:23,429
dankness I would say it would make it up

1711
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,049
make up for all of the [ __ ] they've ever

1712
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:26,129
sold me right like all right yeah

1713
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:28,019
there's one right there

1714
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,670
right yeah yeah that's how was with us

1715
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:31,019
with rug burn we ran up to a bunch of

1716
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,400
rug burn sheets and every one of them

1717
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,059
was like we got an eighth to piece of

1718
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:42,599
them like this is the lengthiest walk

1719
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:44,279
he's looking it's no good we don't I

1720
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,889
don't think gage gets enough credit in

1721
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,720
the game like people more people need to

1722
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:50,819
notice gage green genetics that that's a

1723
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,439
definitely a high-end breeding company

1724
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,090
that gets overlooked in my opinion I do

1725
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,349
the great they're great I mean they've

1726
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,880
got good material they're working with

1727
00:58:55,349 --> 00:59:01,368
that's a lot of it's just a material

1728
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,369
they have is golden joseph OG is amazing

1729
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:07,830
great stopper and so many other great

1730
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:10,619
plants and the Joseph Ocean Beach cross

1731
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:13,409
was one of the one of the highly

1732
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:15,210
sought-after but they're very quick and

1733
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:16,799
gone plants you know that was that was

1734
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,329
come and gone so fast because it went

1735
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,700
out basically as testers and never came

1736
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:26,279
back I may still have a pack of testers

1737
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:28,469
from that I've got honestly I have a

1738
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,119
small manila envelope filled with gauge

1739
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:31,949
green genetics tester bags because you

1740
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:34,320
just used to send me so much maybe like

1741
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:36,599
run what you can right yeah yeah we took

1742
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,490
the dominant oceans out of that one out

1743
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,630
of those and actually bred with them too

1744
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:45,209
we got a new one coming out with that

1745
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:47,220
pre 98 bubble OB Ripper yeah Joseph

1746
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,780
Joseph is just too stringy and I hate

1747
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:50,250
the way he does that so we're gonna hit

1748
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,609
him with that proof hit that pre 90 I

1749
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:55,380
called behind but my prized male is an

1750
00:59:53,608 --> 00:59:58,409
arise male which was started with a

1751
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,450
Daybreaker male from gage yeah I'm not

1752
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:02,909
