62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,800
participate in some of that action and

63
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,780
have a good holiday I had a wonderful

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,939
holiday but when I got home from my

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,400
holiday Shenanigans I went to my grow

66
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,439
space and I stepped in a small puddle of

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
water that was not supposed to be there

68
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,459
that's right I had to drain back up in

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,739
the area where my grow is and there was

70
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,659
a bunch of water in that space so I've

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,459
spent a couple of days getting some

72
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,259
water out doing some cleanup pulling up

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,939
some carpet still have a little bit of

74
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,259
stuff to do this podcast maybe a little

75
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,598
bit shorter than you're used to because

76
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,919
there is more work to be done I got to

77
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,318
get some [ __ ] out of there get some [ __ ]

78
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,119
cleaned up get myself nice and dirty get

79
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,500
back in action but that is not the most

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
important part we're talking about today

81
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,580
I want to know if you've got a plan if

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,819
you've got strategy what are the risks

83
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,280
of [ __ ] going wrong near your grow my

84
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,039
grow there was a flood and the water got

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,378
one inch from plants and the other way

86
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,639
it got inches from a drum set so it

87
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,259
could have been much more disastrous

88
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,359
than it was it did cause a huge problem

89
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,098
it did cause a big mess the only thing

90
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,900
it really really [ __ ] up was my

91
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,000
schedule I've got to throw away some

92
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,860
carpets and some small items and details

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,719
but most of the stuff will be recovered

94
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,400
and repaired but it really messed up my

95
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,620
week it's messing up my timing and my

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,420
flow like I said the podcast will be a

97
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,580
little shorter here but do you have a

98
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,559
strategy what if there's a water leak in

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,900
your grow space or where you are growing

100
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,459
or near there will that water make it to

101
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,319
your grow are you prepared for something

102
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,479
like that is there a floor drain has

103
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,639
that floor drain been maintained uh

104
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,500
what's going on are you prepared for any

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,658
sort of disaster in the grow like water

106
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,519
has been kicking my ass the past couple

107
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:55,019
of days are you prepared for water then

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
of course there's the opposite side of

109
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,860
that one there is fire are you prepared

110
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,679
for a fire so this is just my quick

111
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,000
heads up uh check on your [ __ ] make sure

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,319
all your drains are cool make sure no

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,120
water is coming up anywhere make sure

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,280
nothing's leaking make sure there's no

115
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,900
sparks no loose wires go ahead and do a

116
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,699
quick inspection here at the start of

117
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,319
the Year my friend John told me out of

118
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,238
sight out of mind and that's kind of how

119
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,738
I felt about the plumbing uh that's kind

120
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,600
of how we felt about the water it wasn't

121
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,879
a problem until it was a [ __ ] problem

122
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,160
luckily it didn't destroy anything too

123
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,478
expensive too crazy here but it

124
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,520
definitely slowed me down that's enough

125
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,319
talking about a flood talking about that

126
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,060
I just want to know if you are prepared

127
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,978
uh what are you gonna do if you get a

128
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,079
flood do you have something lined up if

129
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,180
the flood does come can you get the

130
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,379
people down in your area to work on it

131
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,478
without getting yourself in trouble

132
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,279
maybe you're not in a legal place I'm in

133
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,719
a legal State I've only got a few legal

134
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,758
plants in that area where I'm growing

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,780
the plumber the drain guy everybody was

136
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,100
able to go in there and they go nice

137
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,239
plants and I was like yeah quit [ __ ]

138
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,560
looking at them just because they're

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,759
over there in an area and they're cool

140
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
and they can see them it's not a big

141
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,720
deal maybe you're in a place where you

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,759
can't grow and can you quickly hide that

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
grow if some [ __ ] does go wrong in your

144
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,120
uh to your home your rental space

145
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,219
whatever you're doing where you got that

146
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,780
grow can you conceal that should you

147
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,460
need to take some quick action that is

148
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,500
my question to you all right that's just

149
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,478
a heads up that's what's on my mind I

150
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,939
got some ruined shoes and some wet pants

151
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,758
it has not been fun let's move on to

152
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,339
more fun stuff in this podcast uh

153
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,840
recently my friend Mobius Mobius I love

154
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:20,219
you bro I got nothing but love and

155
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,959
respect for you we've become really good

156
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,400
friends over the couple of years I

157
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,019
simply disagree with the comment that

158
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,698
you made on YouTube we're still good

159
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,839
friends bro I'll still smoke a fat joint

160
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,879
with you this is just a really good

161
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,918
topic of conversation so my friend

162
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,560
Mobius left a comment on a YouTube video

163
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,019
I did a video about selecting males and

164
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,000
reversals for breeding projects

165
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,740
I talked about just that how I select

166
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,899
male plants and how I select which

167
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,060
plants I do want to reverse for my

168
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,339
personal breeding projects my friend

169
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,800
Mobius uh he chimed in with his comment

170
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,478
and I fully respect this opinion I just

171
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,978
think this is great podcast material

172
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,478
this is so totally something we should

173
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,459
address I could talk about for a long

174
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
time on a podcast like I said I got

175
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,120
nothing but love and respect for my dude

176
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,918
Mobius don't get this Twisted alright it

177
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,780
says I think another great thing to

178
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,538
think about is if you are breeding to

179
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,819
sell wreck and Med uh to reckon Med

180
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,279
Growers and be a seed company don't get

181
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,478
too stuck on what you like and I kind of

182
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,159
touched on this before but we're going

183
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,740
to elaborate here

184
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,780
it says Instead try to make a diverse

185
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,000
menu think flavors and effects have

186
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,500
fruit have gas have garlic have mint

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,379
have Earth

188
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,839
but also have soaring highs along with

189
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,060
pile driver heavy stuff bottom line is

190
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:34,258
be diverse not only thinking about wreck

191
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,120
Market but Medical Market as well that

192
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,120
is that is very good feedback I like

193
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,280
that but I also disagree with that I

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,280
respectfully disagree with that as a

195
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,559
breeder as the person making the seeds I

196
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,359
don't think about the recreational or

197
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,399
the medical Market at all when I'm

198
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
making a cross

199
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,758
um

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,279
I'm uh maybe selfishly I'm thinking

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,879
about what I like in cannabis when I'm

202
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,799
making a cross I don't think that

203
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,959
um and I'm not gonna this will sound

204
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,960
egotistical but if you took

205
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,299
um Van Gogh and told Van Gogh make some

206
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,500
art that the people will like the people

207
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,939
aren't going to like the art that van

208
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,860
Gogh makes but if you shut the [ __ ] up

209
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,959
and leave Van Gogh alone and let Van

210
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,240
Gogh paint shit's gonna come out amazing

211
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,459
I'm not saying that I'm an artist or a

212
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,680
painter or anything like that but

213
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,318
um I breed what I like and it just

214
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,259
happens that I like plants with certain

215
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,180
terp profiles and certain Buzz types and

216
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,538
certain growth structures and those

217
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,978
plants also are desirable to uh the

218
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,139
general public the people that want to

219
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,120
grow my my followers my fans my

220
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,340
supporters the irie Army the people that

221
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,620
want to grow eye regenetic seeds you

222
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,839
guys happen to like those because I'm

223
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,120
growing it with passion with love for

224
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
what I like to do

225
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,240
um I got a couple of ways I like to

226
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,639
describe this there's an artist called

227
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,879
matus Yahoo he came up a couple of years

228
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,098
ago in the early 2000s 2005-ish the dude

229
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,740
was hot hot [ __ ] his first album uh

230
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,659
first two albums were a amazing but you

231
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,400
could tell that he had spent his entire

232
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,860
life putting those two albums together

233
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,239
and it was everything he had to put that

234
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,340
together it was all of his creativity

235
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,139
from when it started writing up to the

236
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,659
time when those albums were put out that

237
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,538
was everything he had that was his art

238
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,160
those albums are [ __ ] awesome two of

239
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,079
my most favorite albums shake off the

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,460
dust arise and of course live at Stubbs

241
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,359
there might be more stuff before that

242
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,799
but those are the two when he got

243
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
popular that's like his life's work

244
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,180
right there Ah that's what really got

245
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,098
him going he went on tour he got super

246
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,799
known he got super famous he was killing

247
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,479
it because his art came from his heart I

248
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,458
was his connection with his music what

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,158
he did he didn't do it for anybody but

250
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,778
himself so it was [ __ ] awesome after

251
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,939
that the record label came and said hey

252
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:46,559
bro it's time for that second record you

253
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,540
got to put some [ __ ] out

254
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,338
guess what that record kind of bites a

255
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,659
dick that second record no offense

256
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,519
Matisyahu you know what I'm saying

257
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,919
though brother that next record just was

258
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,539
not what we expected what we had hoped

259
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,159
for it sounded bubble gummy it sounded

260
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,899
way over produced it sounded like a

261
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,139
record company took over and demanded a

262
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:07,019
record on a timeline so part of my point

263
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,759
to that is I'm not doing records for a

264
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,560
record company I'm making records for

265
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,059
myself and I'm making sounds that I

266
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,039
think sound good and I'm making Terps

267
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,859
and strains and Crosses that I think

268
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,659
sound good another way that I like to

269
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,278
think about it is I'm a musician I can

270
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,719
read right I can play any kind of music

271
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,939
that's why a lot of things I talk about

272
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,278
I go back to music and that it's always

273
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,600
relatable for me so I'm a musician I can

274
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,759
like I said a moment ago I can read

275
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,800
music I can write music I have a deep

276
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,899
understanding of the way Music Works not

277
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,338
just I'm the drummer but not just in the

278
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,899
drums I understand the way the time

279
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,700
works the way the Dynamics work I've

280
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,379
been on stage I know how to make the

281
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,700
singer sound good by playing a certain

282
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,439
way I know how to make the bass player

283
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,480
sound better I know how to make the beat

284
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
feel a little faster even though it

285
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,500
isn't just by playing in front front of

286
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,599
or behind the beat just a little bit I

287
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,159
have a deep understanding of music I can

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,278
play any kind of music that you want me

289
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,958
to I like to play uh Funky Music I like

290
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,879
to get down and funky of course I love

291
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,399
to play reggae music I love to jam and

292
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,338
get improvisational it all sounds really

293
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,500
good but if you made me play country

294
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,600
it would sound okay but it wouldn't

295
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,879
sound like country music from the heart

296
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,100
it wouldn't have that country music it

297
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,139
would be country music but it wouldn't

298
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,820
be country music and the and for country

299
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,500
music you need something right in there

300
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,180
that's my opinion if you want it to

301
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,620
sound country music you gotta have some

302
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,059
I don't have country in my heart at all

303
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,459
I'm not a country boy I'm a [ __ ] city

304
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,439
boy I got dreadlocks and I wear sneakers

305
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,759
and [ __ ] I'm not I've got no boots or a

306
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,839
hat so I don't have that country feel I

307
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,639
could play the blues because I've had

308
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,959
the [ __ ] blues before but anyway if

309
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,639
you told me to put out a country album

310
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,139
it would be terrible because I don't

311
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,958
care it's not gonna have any heart any

312
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,120
Soul so what I'm doing is maybe it's

313
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,759
selfish of me but I'm breeding for what

314
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,139
I really like I have access to a lot of

315
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,939
plants you guys know that I've worked in

316
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,500
commercial facilities I've Got Friends

317
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,240
that grow I've Got Friends that breed

318
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,039
I'm in groves all the time helping

319
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,079
people out looking at things inspecting

320
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,819
investigating sometimes I see a plant

321
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,259
and I go what's that one bro and they'll

322
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,060
tell me they'll go that's this and I go

323
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,220
I'm gonna need a cut of that and they'll

324
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,539
go well okay and I'll tell them you owe

325
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,000
me this much money for coming here today

326
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,500
instead of paying me I want a cut of

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,820
that and they'll go okay because people

328
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,740
would definitely rather give you a plant

329
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,180
than money most of the time so I get a

330
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,100
lot of cool cuts and [ __ ] people send me

331
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,379
and give me and share with me really

332
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,639
cool cuts so sometimes I'll just see

333
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,559
something and I'll be like that girl

334
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,958
right there needs to be pollinated by

335
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,179
either like the Jack the Ripper mail or

336
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,578
the BC Lemon Skunk mail or possibly King

337
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,559
Solomon everybody's gonna get pollinated

338
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,539
by Solomon before the end of this it'll

339
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,239
be Solomon to everybody before the end

340
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,919
but I just see the plants and I go man

341
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,959
that one right there and that one right

342
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,179
there it's like uh just giving me

343
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,619
modeling clay or sculpting clay I don't

344
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,419
know [ __ ] about sculpting so that was a

345
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,980
bad example but it's like giving me a

346
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,439
big thing of paints and a paintbrush and

347
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,500
a fresh canvas and just letting me go uh

348
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,240
if you told me breed this I'd go I don't

349
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,039
uh I I don't know if I want to do that

350
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,560
like why am I doing that I need to like

351
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,240
smoke a plant or look at a plant or be

352
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,559
in the room with the plant and the plant

353
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,778
will say hey

354
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,000
bro and maybe this is [ __ ] crazy but

355
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:05,120
I can hear it the plant goes you shut

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,120
down

357
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,920
and I go huh I should probably breed

358
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
this strawberry Starburst plant to the

359
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,519
Jack the Ripper male and then I do it

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,399
and most of the time it's [ __ ]

361
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,220
awesome so Mobius I do like your idea of

362
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,320
having the diverse catalog and keeping

363
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,540
medical and recreational markets in mind

364
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,700
and that that's another thing we could

365
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,578
[ __ ] talk on but I do like that idea

366
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,079
but that is not uh that is not my style

367
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:32,939
I don't think that would work for me I

368
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,039
think me sticking with doing what I like

369
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,079
has been working pretty well and it

370
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,099
would be fake and it would be uh it

371
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,838
wouldn't be growing from my heart

372
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,579
breeding with love which is my motto

373
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,399
that's what it's all about for me that

374
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:46,559
would be that would that's one step too

375
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,120
close to breeding with my wallet I'm not

376
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,099
thinking about my wallet and my

377
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,778
pocketbook and [ __ ] when I'm reading but

378
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,159
also I like the fact that you said keep

379
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,259
the patience the medical and the

380
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,639
recreational users in mind that is a

381
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,860
great thing

382
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,299
um the way that I see that I'm gonna go

383
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,620
right back to music and I've used this

384
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,379
before

385
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,778
um Mobius is into I know my dude Mobius

386
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,578
you listen to heavier music than I do I

387
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,078
listen to fish and reggae and stuff like

388
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,299
that I think I got Moby ascended fish

389
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,739
because Trey is a [ __ ] Maniac but uh

390
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:15,659
we listen to different [ __ ] so the way I

391
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,220
describe it is uh some people want to

392
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,379
listen to reggae if you want to listen

393
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,120
to reggae that's irie genetic Seed

394
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,679
Company if you want to correlate music

395
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,899
to seed Brands if you want to listen to

396
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,778
reggae that's [ __ ] I'm that is me

397
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,278
right over here if you want to listen to

398
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,600
um I don't even have other breeders to

399
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,919
compare to [ __ ] different kinds of

400
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,420
music I should have not gone down that

401
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,458
route if you want to do some gangster

402
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,139
rap [ __ ] we all know that Masonic is the

403
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,699
dude for the Compton gangster rap kind

404
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,560
of vibe so if that's what you want what

405
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm saying is if you want to diversify

406
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,458
the grow instead of expecting one

407
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,019
breeder to offer everything that's when

408
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,359
you got to go to different breeders like

409
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,159
I know that if I want like some cushy

410
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,839
stuff that I could go to DNA genetics

411
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,639
and those guys have all that cushy [ __ ]

412
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,220
if I want a Wilson cross I'm definitely

413
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,778
gonna go talk to Masonic smoker uh if I

414
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,940
want some jelly bean stuff I'm gonna go

415
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,039
talk to my friend Miss Jill if I want

416
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,839
some uh some of that Grandpa's cook

417
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,240
cookies or eat those cookies I gotta go

418
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,800
talk to my dude Colin if I want heavy

419
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
duty fruity which is in the garden right

420
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,719
now and bangs out I'd go talk to Adam

421
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Dunn that is th seeds so you just gotta

422
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,278
instead of uh having one expecting one

423
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,778
breeder to diversify the growth for you

424
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,100
that's what I recommend and I know

425
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,480
you're doing this Mobius you've got

426
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,220
seeds from a lot of different breeders

427
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,379
and you kill it with all of them and

428
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,000
that helps you have a variety a little

429
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,620
bit of difference in the garden of

430
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
course I've got four or five three or

431
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,220
four four or five different males and

432
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,778
reversals that I work with but I'm still

433
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,060
limited to how many things I can produce

434
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,679
so I take my mail plan or my reverse

435
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,778
plant and I hit it to 10 or 12 different

436
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,819
ladies and then that's what I've got to

437
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,559
offer for this season or this section of

438
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,600
my I took up that much breeding time

439
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,518
until I do more breeding or whatever so

440
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,259
I can offer you so much but

441
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,519
the other breeders they've got totally

442
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,039
different [ __ ] than me so they can

443
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,839
definitely diversify your portfolio a

444
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,240
little more widely because they're not

445
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,339
breeding with the same stock so uh dude

446
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,659
I love your input I love your feedback I

447
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,399
love your idea

448
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,719
and I also love that I disagree and

449
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
we're still going to be [ __ ] good

450
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,920
friends all right you said what did he

451
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360

452
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,578

454

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,799

if you guys have been following along

467
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,179
you know that I've gotten access to a

468
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,078
bunch of plants the Mel Franks Urban

469
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,879

moon tower has definitely got the Earth

474
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,979
in there so I've got a lot of those

475
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,720
covered uh The Soaring highs most of my

476

high the arise crosses the pile driver

479
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,180
heavy stuff that is kind of where I'm

480
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,220
lacking but I'm working toward that

481
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,859
direction that's not uh that's not my

482
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,240
favorite thing but as I'm getting older

483
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,339
um so it's funny I went to through a

484
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,899
weird shift in the weed that I like I

485
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,060
guess when I was younger I just wanted

486
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,919
to get baked I was so hyper and so

487
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,838
[ __ ] rambunctious that I just wanted

488
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,599
to get baked and sit down just [ __ ]

489
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,639
give me enough [ __ ] heavy heavy weed

490
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
enough Indica to just make me [ __ ]

491
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,539
normal just uh just chill me out just a

492
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,458
little [ __ ] bit and then as I got

493
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,259
older I started working more I was like

494
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,599
I can't smoke all this Indica I got [ __ ]

495
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,519
to do then I started smoking more sativa

496
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,440
started owning businesses and [ __ ]

497
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,120
doing podcasts and when you smoke a big

498
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,380
dab of some Indica that puts you down on

499
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,060
a podcast and you're just sitting here

500
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,039
like this

501
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,138
it's not a good podcast you got to be

502
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,120
[ __ ] sativit out and be talkative and

503
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,740
have the brain go and so I shifted into

504
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,240
that but now

505
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,039
um in the winter time I feel like I've

506
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,778
been going too fast I just need to chill

507
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,399
out I need some time with the lady time

508
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,318
with the dogs time on the couch just

509
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,459
chilling uh sometimes I know that my

510
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,980
lady's looking at me like you're just

511
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,480
going way too fast so that's when I need

512
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,759
like a big dab of some chilled out

513
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,500
Indica so I am kind of working toward

514
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,359
that Indica sort of cushy sort of stuff

515
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,240
in the lineup so many people are doing

516
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,578
it I want to do it uniquely I do have a

517
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,078
great strategy for that but it seems

518
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,779
like I'm offering most of the things you

519
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,298
ask for but still uh don't be afraid to

520
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,399
Branch out and have more breeders in

521
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,660
your garden there's no reason to lock it

522
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,540
in with just one I know a lot of people

523
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,220
try to do all irie all irie runs in

524
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,500
their Garden I appreciate that but don't

525
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,240
be afraid to grow other breeders Mobius

526
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,679
my dude that was a [ __ ] great

527
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,419
question a great comment you got me

528
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,519
rambling for at least 10 minutes on that

529
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,900
[ __ ] I do appreciate that thank you bro

530
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,700
I look forward to hanging out smoking

531
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,919
with you sometime soon you're just a

532
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,600
couple of stay dates away from me we

533
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,580
should get together alright I do have

534
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,459
another message here in front of me uh

535
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:59,178
this one came from the uh the grow help

536
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,259
tab on iregenetics.com if you go to

537
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,120
iregenetics.com there's a tab that says

538
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:04,798
grow help you can click on there and it

539
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,538
will give you the opportunity to ask me

540
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,240
a question I will print that out and

541
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:10,919
read it here on the show a quick update

542
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,900
that tab was broken for a little while

543
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,640
so if you sent me some grow help

544
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,038
questions and you feel like I ignored

545
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
you I did and it wasn't on purpose that

546
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,460
[ __ ] grow help tab had a major

547
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,980
malfunction I did some website updates

548
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,779
and that did not get corrected along

549
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,400
with the updates uh shout out to the web

550
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,960
guy he did correct it now there was a

551
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,940
short time it didn't work nobody's fault

552
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,319
we didn't notice there's a lot of [ __ ]

553
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,660
that goes on when we do that but anyway

554
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,279
it is corrected so if you've sent your

555
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,740
grow help questions and you feel like

556
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,538
you got ignored I apologize that [ __ ]

557
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,759
was broken send it again I'll do my best

558
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,798
to get in on the show as soon as

559
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,940
possible all right this one came from

560
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,339
our friend I don't know if they want

561
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,640
their name said it doesn't say that part

562
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,459
anyway it says Rasta Jeff at what point

563
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,100
do signs of nutrient deficiency become

564
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,380
fall colors that's a really good also

565
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:01,139
kind of a confusing question I can see

566
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,179
how you could confuse some nutrient

567
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,620
deficiencies and some of the colors that

568
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,840
the plants make at the end as it does

569
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,339
what is called senescence I will turn

570
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,678
into those fall colors when you start

571
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,659
flushing there are no nutrients left in

572
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,179
the leaves it will make beautiful fall

573
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,298
colors at what point do nutrient

574
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,100
deficiency become fall colors that

575
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,599
depends on if you're flushing or not I

576
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,339
guess it's kind of

577
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,639
um the fall some plants won't make fall

578
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,319
colors some will make fall colors uh and

579
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,880
some will show you those colors because

580
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,918
of a nutrient deficiency I think my

581
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,679
answer to this is mostly going to be

582
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,380
this is plant and strain specific I know

583
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,880
that the morning do if you let it go

584
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,799
long enough it'll start making orange

585
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,299
and goldish colored leaves but that

586
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,918
always happens during the flush that's

587
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:45,298
during the flushing phase so that's what

588
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,220
you're talking about the Fall colors

589
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,500
almost everything will start turning

590
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,120
yellow and pale if you don't feed it

591
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,220
so

592
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,659
um I think nutrient deficiency look out

593
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,400
for that you should know what that looks

594
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,100
like the Fall colors are going to be

595
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,320
phenotypical expression and vary by

596
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,639
plants so so I think the only way to

597
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:04,918
really determine that would be to grow

598
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,140
the plant a couple of times see if you

599
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,120
do get those weird colors see if you can

600
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,038
identify what that color could be caused

601
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,899
by try to correct it if you can't

602
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,359
correct that that's probably just the

603
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,820
plant expressing its funky end of life

604
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,558
beautiful fall colors

605
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,500
now there is more to this question it

606
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,139
goes on it says also how do you breed a

607
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,940
strain to finish faster is it as simple

608
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,460
as Crossing it with a faster finishing

609
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,860
strain because I have some blueberry now

610
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,259
that finishes in 53 days it's my

611
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,000
favorite I've ever grown thank you for

612
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,619
all of your info and your podcast it

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,419
really helps bro

614
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,939
you've got a blueberry that finishes

615
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,160
completely done in 53 days that is

616
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,600
impressive that is amazing

617
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,580
um I prefer plants that go a little

618
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,678
longer I think you get usually get more

619
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,359
herb and more potency but if that

620
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,179
thing's finished in 53 days and

621
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,859
satisfies you that is a phenomenal plan

622
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,140
you are a lucky dude to have found that

623
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,699
in a Fino hunt uh everybody wants a

624
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,620
clone of that I'll give you my uh my

625
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,179
address for a clone of that one let's

626
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,399
stay focused here

627
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,860
uh the question was how do you breed a

628
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,840
strain to finish faster and then he says

629
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,619
is it as simple as Crossing it with a

630
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,619
faster finishing strain it is that easy

631
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,719
but it's also not that easy it kind of

632
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,298
depends on what you plan to do with

633
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,640
these seeds because the first batch is

634
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:24,960
going to be a little bit uh unstable is

635
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,700
the word that I want to use here you're

636
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,159
going to find a lot of variation you're

637
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,019
going to find phenotypical variation and

638
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,720
in that variation we will find different

639
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,879
finishing times so this is a trait that

640
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,620
gets passed on so what I would do I

641
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,179
would find the female that you like but

642
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:41,219
you want to slow or speed up her

643
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,038
flowering time you want to take her from

644
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,259
70 to 60 or maybe even down to 50 days

645
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,298
you might not be able to do this in the

646
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,740
first attempt so let's talk about this

647
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:52,019
it kind of depends on if you want to

648
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,460
breed these seeds for yourself just to

649
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,460
play with or if you have some intention

650
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,380
of putting these seeds out to Market if

651
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,480
you find a good female plant that you

652
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,460
want to use as your female candidate I

653
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,759
would find a male plant that flowers

654
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,679
more quickly than that female I would

655
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,419
find a drastic difference if you've got

656
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,580
a female that goes 70 days you're trying

657
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,860
to chop it down to 60 I'd find a male

658
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,839
plant that finishes around that 55 day

659
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:17,099
Mark that way you got the ratio in there

660
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,500
right in the middle somewhere you'll get

661
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,119
that early finishing phenotype but

662
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,980
what's going to happen

663
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,079
or what most likely is going to happen

664
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,519
these are plants and this is nature and

665
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,079
I haven't drawn a Punnett square or a

666
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,298
Mendel chart to actually figure this out

667
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,279
completely perfectly but so you take

668
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,079
that long finishing female and that

669
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,899
short finishing male and you pollinate

670
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,678
now 33 percent of those seeds are going

671
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,000
to be shorter finishing phenotypes 33 of

672
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,220
those seeds are going to be longer

673
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,140
finishing phenotypes and the other 33

674
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,880
have the potential to be whatever when

675
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,100
we breathe like this we kind of unlock

676
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Pandora's Box the F ones are going to be

677
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,599
wild so if you're reading this just for

678
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,880
yourself you do have the potential to

679
00:22:54,599 --> 00:23:00,359
find that early finishing phenotype in

680
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,760
the F1 generation that you are making if

681
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,019
you are selling these seeds and you're

682
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,079
going to tell people that they finish

683
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,839
quickly the F1 generation will not be

684
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:13,319
stable or reliable you will need to make

685
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,599
an F2 F3 possibly even an F4 generation

686
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,700
so the first time you do it find that

687
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,918
fast finishing mail pollinate your

688
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,558
longer finishing female and you've got a

689
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,880
batch of seeds grow those seeds you may

690
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,639
find what you're looking for for

691
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,919
yourself in that batch of seeds if you

692
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,659
do find earlier finishing phenotypes in

693
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,120
that batch I would encourage you to use

694
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,400
those either for back Crossing or for

695
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,439
further filial generations to even

696
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,120
further reduce the flowering time of

697
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,620
this plant let me say that in a little

698
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,479
bit more clear terms because I know that

699
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,339
was a lot of crazy mumbo jumbo for some

700
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,798
of you so we've made this first cross

701
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,720
right we took our long finishing girl

702
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,339
our short finishing meal we made seeds

703
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,500
out of that

704
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:54,959
I expect that hopefully we find at least

705
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,419
one quick finishing girl also we're

706
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,940
gonna find one quick finishing boy this

707
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,100
is our F1 generation we've got F1 boy at

708
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,720
F1 girl let's put them together and

709
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,779
pollinate we have now made an F2

710
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,759
Generation from there let's find that

711
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,918
quickest finishing female and quickest

712
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,919
finishing male and breed those together

713
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,600
now we're making F3 guess what these f3s

714
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,580
are going to start getting a little bit

715
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,079
more uniform or they're going to be

716
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,119
completely wild depending on the

717
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,740
selections which we have made but we're

718
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,439
going to focus again we're going to find

719
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,759
that quick finishing phenotypes now

720
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,919
we're going to find the super quickest

721
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,779
finishing phenotypes we can out of the

722
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,820
boy and the girl we're gonna breed them

723
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,859
together now at this point we've really

724
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,379
started locking in that super fast

725
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,678
finishing phenotype everything from here

726
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,240
out should be closer to the goal amount

727
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,740
of finishing days that we're looking for

728
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,019
for the phenotypes which we have to

729
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,779
select from so you probably started with

730
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:50,819
that female I said started at 70 days uh

731
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,158
the F1 generation he found one and they

732
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,658
finished it like what 60 days we bred

733
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,000
those together then we found more that

734
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,039
finished at what 58 days then we found

735
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,419
some that finished at 55 and then we

736
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,500
kept working with those and breeding

737
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,780
them out and now we're all the way to

738
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,500
the F5 generation and we've got reliable

739
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,178
plants that finish in 55 days it will

740
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,099
take you several generations to get

741
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,259
there if you want reliable homogeneous

742
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:15,719
seeds or stable is the word we like to

743
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,400
use in the Cannabis industry but you can

744
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,440
do it or you could just do it the simple

745
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,720
way across it one time and hope to find

746
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,400
what you're looking for you do have the

747
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,159
potential to shorten that flowering time

748
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,200
every filial generation if you do proper

749
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,880
selections so here's another piece of

750
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,000
advice another hint another tip of what

751
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,740
I would do I would do parallel breeding

752
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,599
lines I don't talk about this a lot on

753
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,839
the show but I have mentioned it we're

754
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,339
focusing on faster finishing lines for

755
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,019
the first part of this question we want

756
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,939
to get down to you've got one that

757
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,158
finishes in 53 days I wouldn't go any

758
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,538
shorter than that but I would breed that

759
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,220
to other things and try to make that

760
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,740
other [ __ ] shorter I would reverse it

761
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,839
and breed it to some 70-day stuff and

762
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,700
then I would reverse the 53-day finisher

763
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,740
take the pollen from that put it on a

764
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,298
70-day finisher and see if I can reduce

765
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,339
that flowering time I would definitely

766
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,139
do that but let me get back into the

767
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:06,899
main topic of what I'm saying here we're

768
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,940
breeding on this line for flowering time

769
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,820
so keep directing that breeding towards

770
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,919
shorter flowering time then from the

771
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:16,079
same batch of seeds that F1 batch of

772
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,940
seeds you make so you took the 70-day

773
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,038
plant and the 55-day mail or whatever

774
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,320
you pollinated them you made a batch of

775
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,480
seeds we found that short finishing one

776
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,579
of the male and the girl and that's our

777
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,058
uh we're gonna call that the fast line

778
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,019
now on the other side let's focus on uh

779
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,178
potency

780
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,158
because not only do I want that plant to

781
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,679
finish quickly but I also need it to be

782
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,240
highly potent so I'm going to breed a

783
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,159
whole another project in another room

784
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,960
this is another project I'm going to

785
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,880
breed just for potency I don't care how

786
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,440
long these plants take to finish I don't

787
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,360
care what they taste like what they look

788
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,640
like I need potency so I'm going to find

789
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,500
a male and a female out of these seeds

790
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm going to breed them I'm going to

791
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,740
find the most highly potent or I'm going

792
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,199
to grow them I'm going to find the best

793
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,640
looking most potent female I can and the

794
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,558
most potent looking male that I can find

795
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,419
that's a hard one to discern there but

796
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,038
find the best female the best dude and

797
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,960
breed them then I'm going to grow out

798
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,000
those seeds the F2 seeds I'm going to

799
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,740
grow those once again find the most

800
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,480
potent female and the most potent male

801
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,179
I'm going to breed them I'm gonna go F3

802
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,700
F4 F5 doing the same thing solely

803
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,038
focused on potency now when I get to F5

804
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,558
or F6 I'm going to take my fast

805
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,359
finishing version of this line and my

806
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,480
highly potent version of this line and

807
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:31,019
I'm going to breed those together and

808
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,599
that's how I make my own true F1 line

809
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:35,158
that is fast finishing and highly potent

810
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,418
and also has the other traits you're

811
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,340
looking for the reason I want to do

812
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,919
these two lines separately is because

813
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,298
it's really hard to isolate multiple

814
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,059
traits if you're breeding for

815
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:47,158
specifically that finishing time stick

816
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:50,639
with that fast finishing time get that

817
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,500
to a F4 F5 then find a male out of that

818
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,020
and use that mail to pollinate other

819
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,419
ladies to make that fast finishing time

820
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,220
so then on the other line I would focus

821
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,460
on the potency instead of focusing on

822
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,319
potency and flowering time just use two

823
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,120
different lines of the same thing so now

824
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,579
let's say that that tall longer

825
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,199
finishing plant is Strawberry Fields and

826
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,839
that shorter finishing plant that I want

827
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,400
to use for my mail is a rise he's not a

828
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,599
quick finisher and not a quick flowering

829
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,519
plant but we're going to say that for

830
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,319
the sake of this project let's say I

831
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,418
took that a rise and I pollinate these

832
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,519
Strawberry Fields or that makes

833
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,620
strawberry Starburst seeds it really

834
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,720
does now let's say that I want to focus

835
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,119
on breeding one for quicker finishing

836
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,419
and focus on one for that super potency

837
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:36,239
I would be feed strawberry Starburst a

838
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,500
the a line straight up for that quicker

839
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,900
finishing then I would breed the

840
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,880
strawberry Starburst b line for the

841
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,380
potency and while I was doing it if I

842
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,360
let the seeds out to Market or if I

843
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,278
shared them sold them passed them out in

844
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,819
any way I would clearly label them

845
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:54,058
strawberry Starburst F1 a line or

846
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:56,939
strawberry Starburst A-line F1 uh B-Line

847
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:59,278
F2 B-Line F3 just make sure that they

848
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,960
are labeled and then those seeds will be

849
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,099
great seeds on their own they're still

850
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,419
going to be potent they're going to have

851
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,579
all the other traits you're looking for

852
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,400
but I'm specifically breeding for one

853
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:10,319
thing and my plan and my strategy now

854
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,900
when I get that one to where I know that

855
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,158
they flower in 55 days and when I get

856
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
this one where I know that the potency

857
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,000
is off the charts I'm gonna use that

858
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,399
quicker flowering mail hit that super

859
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,740
potent female and hopefully I can get a

860
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,959
60-day finisher that blows your [ __ ]

861
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,720
mind so I hope that made sense because

862
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,700
yes it can be that easy it can be as

863
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,038
easy as pollinating a female plant with

864
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,659
a quicker finishing meal plan yes it can

865
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:35,460
be that easy but if you want to sell

866
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,659
those seeds if you want to put them to

867
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,880
Market if you really want to continue

868
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,620
that project there is more work to done

869
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,299
and that is breeding them to different

870
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,879
filial generations and if you're going

871
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:47,099
to focus on speed I would breed that b

872
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,080
line to focus on potency breed them

873
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,398
together at some point in the future all
