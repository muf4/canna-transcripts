other churches no matter their path or

73
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,150
faith to believe that whatever their God

74
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,060
is that cannabis is the holy nail the

injuries or feelings I can laugh at

159
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:23,869
myself because I've always said I'm a

feet back off that window that's how

191

193
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,340
Michigan injures Kevin and I decide to

194
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:14,829
go exploring

195
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:19,689

198
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,829
we're 20 minutes into the walk have no

199
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,110
idea where we're at and I have 1%

200
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,709
battery power I said Oh Kevin we're

201
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,660

205
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,930
phone not at my feet there is a big tree

206
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:54,129
thing that grew up into the sidewalk I

207
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:57,879
literally bounced my lips on your hand

208
00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:00,668
it's why I kind of sprained my hand but

209
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,709
I knew it was bad because Kevin come

210
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:04,359
running and he said are you okay I said

211
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,038
I am and then he said well you should

212
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,300
have been watching your feet I said I'm

213
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:12,569
trying to figure out where the hell

214
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,978
we're at we're staying in the Airbnb

215
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:18,639

216
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:22,990

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,710

218
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,939

219
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,519
we're gonna get back to the Airbnb

220
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,469
phone's dead and I'm looking around and

221
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,649
I'm not getting a vibe that I can ask

222
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,870
you how do I get back to my place

223
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,360
finally I see a young urban professional

224
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,929
probably early 30s with the baby on his

225
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,379
back and I say I hate to bother you but

226
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:49,989
I am so lost can you help me and he says

227
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:52,149
I will walk you as far as my brownstone

228
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,720
and then I'll tell you how to get from

229
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:58,299

230
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,700
into the walk he goes I can't help but

231
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:03,579
notice your earrings she's gotten pot

232
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,320
leaf earrings you guys and I said yeah I

233
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,500
guess is the earrings were the only

234
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,260
cannabis related item of clothing you at

235
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,899
the moment I think probably the only

236
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,850
thing you could really see okay I had

237
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,309
like a vest on cuz it was kinda chilly

238
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,379
there in DC as well there was no there

239
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,599
was no pot nothing visible like I

240
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:24,399
usually have on nothing glass or

241
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,950
anything but these were visible and I

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,610
said

243
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:32,240
yes I'm a marijuana advocate and he says

244
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,550
I I don't like this whole legalization

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,279
thing I have a lot of questions and I

246
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,500
said she got the perfect lady right here

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,319
and he was like what do you mean and I

248
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,490
said I'm kind of known for talking a lot

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,190
of [ __ ] about marijuana so we get

250
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,940
talking I learned quite a bit about this

251
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,200
young man

252
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,420
I learned his father is a cardiologist

253
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,509
his brother is a surgeon in one of the

254
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:02,659
branches of the military he is a

255
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:05,779
financial planner his wife is a CEO of a

256
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:08,779
company and they're not there they're

257
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,919
frightened about cannabis the cartels

258
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:14,149
are gonna come in and everything

259
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,360
stereotypical is what he is frightened

260
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,159
about we get to his brownstone and he's

261
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,289
asked me questions about how I feel

262
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,659
about legalization and I say for a

263
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:26,089
family like yourself legalization is the

264
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:28,819
way to go in Colorado it's track seed to

265
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,910
sale there's no funny business going on

266
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,160
we got to his brownstone and he says I'm

267
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:37,339
enjoying our conversation so much I'm

268
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,289
going to walk you to your Airbnb Lipton

269
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,410
I did flip him that's awesome

270
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,599
by the time we got to the Airbnb he was

271
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:48,169
convinced I told him Kevin's story I

272
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,580
told him I said I said you know I really

273
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:52,459
like you I'm not gonna say his name

274
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,310
although I did know it I said what makes

275
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,650
Kevin and I sitting down and smoking a

276
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,779
joint or me doing a DAB what makes that

277
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,579
any different than you and your wife

278
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,799
consuming a glass of wine when your

279
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,629
children are in bed I said I bet you do

280
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,309
that don't you and he said I never

281
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:11,809
thought about it that way

282
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:13,609
and most people don't so he told me he's

283
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:17,119
not so frightened now about legalization

284
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,769
and that may be controlled marijuana is

285
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,419
the way to go good he brought him to the

286
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,549
green side do you think he's gonna go

287
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:24,318
talk to his parents who were ideal

288
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,479
educated and teach them about cannabis

289
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,799
also he's gonna go a step farther he

290
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
said he would talk to people in the

291
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,929
financial institutions around there what

292
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,870
is the what is the reason we can't work

293
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:38,058
with reputable cannabis companies that's

294
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,100
awesome now kevin says gale you know you

295
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:42,528
as much as a goofball as I am and you

296
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,499
all know I am a goofball when I need to

297
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:48,679
be I can be articulate and I can be

298
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:51,019
personable and I think I think maybe

299
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,338
that was my whole mission there just

300
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,049
that one interaction that one

301
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,670
interaction set places just to be that

302
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,349
angel because I knew the next day would

303
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,870
all be a bunch of people like us

304
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,610
everybody medicated my word wasn't gonna

305
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,828
mean anything there maybe you're

306
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,999
changing cannabis there right now maybe

307
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,258
he's putting something into action

308
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,339
they're getting a bank going and they

309
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,649
won't have the struggles that we have

310
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,370
here in Colorado I would like I would

311
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,600
love that

312
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,938
a little angel moment that you have

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,250
provided there so that was like that

314
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:17,990
that was my big moment from beautiful DC

315
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,610
I'm sorry that you hurt yourself but I'm

316
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,379
glad you were able to spread some

317
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,688
knowledge and turn some people onto our

318
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,250
side yes well thank you for doing that

319
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:28,068
do you want to keep going with stories

320
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,159
or do you want to I don't know let me

321
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:34,818
ask Mike Mike here he he knows a lot

322
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:37,129
about the laws that is what I would say

323
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:41,389
your biggest part of the industry is

324
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,430
that's the part of the industry that I

325
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:44,720
have locked down more than anyone else I

326
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,278
know that's why we call him white Mike

327
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,439
right he's the guy that follows the

328
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,838
rules and he does follow the rules and

329
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:52,399
you knows what the rules that try what

330
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,809
I'm trying to do something when I'm

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,980
getting a little too out of hand I'm

332
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:58,360
trying to break three rules at once

333
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,188
Michael say break one law at a time bro

334
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,678
ever been given is if you get a break or

335
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:06,230
a ruler Allah break one ruler law at a

336
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:07,730
time I said this morning when young kids

337
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,379
were asking me about you know the

338
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,120
weekend and doing this or that I was

339
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,819
like the best advice I could give you is

340
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,528
do one illegal thing one stupid thing at

341
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,759
a time don't be doing all kinds of dumb

342
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,649
[ __ ] at what you're gonna get in trouble

343
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,600
it's when you start combo and [ __ ] up

344
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,070
that all the shenanigans really good

345
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,420
and everybody needs a friend like Mike

346
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,490
around sometimes you got to have a guy

347
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,019
to pull the reigns ago hey you're going

348
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,129
[ __ ] crazy you just need a guy to

349
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,899
remind you that you're slipping

350
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:35,210
especially some of us that are very

351
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:37,399
impulsive we don't think so one of my

352
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,460
concerns is people say that I do a lot

353
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,189
of boneheaded things and one of them

354
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,220
they think I'm terrible for being so

355
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,430
transparent traveling from state legal

356
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:56,290
state to legal state with as I say my

357
00:13:49,429 --> 00:14:01,250
medicine it's a real real gray area and

358
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:04,279
basically you're putting yourself at the

359
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,860
mercy of every law enforcement agency

360
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,829
whose jurisdiction you happen to travel

361
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,340
through on the ground so just because

362
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,080
the TSA and Denver doesn't give a [ __ ]

363
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,170
doesn't mean that a stewardess won't

364
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,340
radio ahead and have the local PD for

365
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:24,019
wherever you're landing

366
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,300
ruin your trip okay advice there when

367
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,299
it's from legal state to legal state or

368
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:32,299
medical state to medical state you're

369
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:34,879
lowering lowering your odds of having a

370
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,319
shitty trip when you land and having law

371
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,799
enforcement we're waiting to ruin your

372
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,450
day but right now as far as I can recall

373
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,349
there's only one state with what they

374
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,450
call reciprocity meaning they consider

375
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,080
your state's medical marijuana card is

376
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:53,780
valid and that's Nevada but they don't

377
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,780
say explicitly that it's kosher to fly

378
00:14:53,779 --> 00:15:00,409
into Nevada with product you picked up

379
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:05,929
in another legal state so it's an

380
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:12,980
incredibly gray very close to the called

381
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:15,009
you are transporting yep federal the

382
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,639
feds don't care unless it's enough to

383
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:22,549
distribute though that seems to be more

384
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,860
of the issue TSA will tell me their

385
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,209
mission is more bombs and things that

386
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,830
are going to do it other paths

387
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,990
if you can't hurt somebody with it right

388
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,649
now GSA doesn't have time to care Metro

389
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,619
in Vegas because I've been I

390
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,499
pushed it to the limits they told me

391
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:41,139
what I bring is nothing leave me alone

392
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:44,850
they are looking for people that are

393
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:48,039
transporting large amounts trafficking

394
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,990
there's one business right now in Alaska

395
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:52,389
their production facility in one of

396
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,860
their shops are like well we would

397
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,389
consider half the country away because

398
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,459
it's an Alaskan one side of the state

399
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,100
can be days travel from the other side

400
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,868
and they're flying product back and

401
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,519
forth right now and it's a major news

402
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:05,619
story that comes up every two months

403
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,818
another news outlet I'll hear about it

404
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:09,009
go holy [ __ ] they're putting weed on a

405
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:10,899
plane but in Alaska those little jumper

406
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,308
planes are like those little jumper

407
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,688
planes is just like driving a bus from

408
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:15,188
Springs to Denver you know I mean

409
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:17,259
there's just it's such a rural place

410
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:18,730
that's so far apart that [ __ ] is normal

411
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,899
for them they drive to the plane they

412
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,249
get on the plane to drive to other

413
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,899
landing they get in the other truck and

414
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,889
drive that to their spot yep just what

415
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,649
they do in Alaska

416
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:29,948
don't you think as advocates or

417
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:32,318
activists sometimes we do have to push

418
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:35,769
things in those grey areas because I

419
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:38,528
will say why do I have to follow the

420
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,870
rules when they're not even concrete all

421
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:42,249
the time that's where the change comes

422
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,129
from and that's how we end up with

423
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:47,230
actual rules like right now you can take

424
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,120
booze on a plane I think if you follow

425
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,670
very specific rules I'll sell it to you

426
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,990
there but you can't open it on you have

427
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:57,549
to follow very specific if you're drunk

428
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,028
at altitude all sorts of crazy [ __ ]

429
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:03,188
happens because there's not a flood yeah

430
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:06,818
Lange yeah they won't let you board if

431
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:08,168
they think you're drunk but so far we

432
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,359
haven't had anybody freak out up in the

433
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,759
on canvas please keep that streak going

434
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,588
people as advocates or activists or

435
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,419
whatever you'd like to title us is there

436
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:18,548
our responsibility to follow the rules

437
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,288
and play fair so we don't [ __ ] it up or

438
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:21,908
is it our responsibility to push the

439
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:25,000
limit so that things change the way we

440
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,470
need it it's both okay like is that why

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,328
there's a white mic version of activism

442
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,278
the dab and granny version of activism

443
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:32,819
the Rebs version of activism which we

444
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:32,819
can see here

445
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,819
situation that arises introspect it

446
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:41,410
takes all kinds like when I first heard

447
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,939
we were coming to a legit cannabis

448
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,950
Church I was like Jeff where are you

449
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,460
taking me and I walked in and I was like

450
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,319
oh he's taking me home like but it's not

451
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,819
my type of activism it's not something

452
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,899
that I would wake up on Monday morning

453
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:57,490
and say today I'm going to found and I

454
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,890
have a feeling that the Rebbe here would

455
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,410
be substantially less comfortable than I

456
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,080
am going in front of City Council in

457
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,600
Lobby lobbying for a specific zoning

458
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,058
change or something of that nature

459
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:12,219
probably it's just a guess but well yeah

460
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:16,000
I have legal schooling I'm actually a

461
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,769
law student on hiatus and I'm more or

462
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,390
less the counsel for the church so I

463
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,788
have to deal with all our zoning and

464
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,350
stuff but exactly what I'm talking about

465
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,879
the time when I bring it up people look

466
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,379
at me like I'm talking gibberish or a

467
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,780
language they've never heard before no I

468
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,390
do consulting on the side I don't raise

469
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:32,859
revenue for the church I worked a law

470
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,950
office for like four years

471
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,740
so saves me a lot of attorney fees for

472
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,569
the church absolutely that's how I found

473
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,829
you is your facebook posts everybody was

474
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,329
like if you're following cannabis

475
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,470
activism check out this guy and I found

476
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,329
you through your legal actions and

477
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,500
Facebook posts yeah I used to post a lot

478
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:51,069
of great things that would educate me

479
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,619
keep me on top of stuff yeah being a

480
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:55,658
religious guy anytime I get politically

481
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:59,769
active I have to run on the Republican

482
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:01,419
ticket but I did I actually did delegate

483
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:04,150
all the way to the state level this year

484
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:06,900
it's got a lot of them to flip their

485
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,130
stance on cannabis because they're

486
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,780
scared they don't have voters in

487
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,549
Colorado it's like third of the

488
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:18,399
unaffiliated third Democrat 30%

489
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:20,769
Republican 3030 and then 10% third

490
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,460
parties the only way to win is the

491
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:25,839
flipped unaffiliated and so I told the

492
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,000
Republicans only way that's happening is

493
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,428
to support our state rights for cannabis

494
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,890
because you're Republican you stand for

495
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,480
state rights that's what we're seeing

496
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,549
naturally right now is a bunch of

497
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,679
Republicans really standing up for

498
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:40,658
cannabis specifically as the states

499
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,070
rights issue I never thought I'd find

500
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:44,280
myself agreeing with Cory Gardner on

501
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:45,929
anything it's amazing isn't it

502
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,940
yep and all of a sudden I'm like I'm

503
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,170
kind of a court garter fan and just

504
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,380
saying that out loud might give me

505
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,880
ostracized at holidays but like he's

506
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,560
really standing up for Colorado on the

507
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,790
state's Rice's she won really went to

508
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,829
battle for us and that's what we need

509
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:04,230
and we have to keep open minded like you

510
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:06,720
said I never thought I would be agreeing

511
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,829
with certain people either hmm but

512
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,029
you're out there changing people's minds

513
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:10,529
granny you're the one out there doing

514
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,970
the mind changing well that's just

515
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:18,089
because I mean finding those little

516
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:20,910
seeds of mine change you're so much

517
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,349
easier - you're not intimidating you

518
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,690
don't have your non-threatening people

519
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:26,099
can listen to this beautiful older lady

520
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,559
that's already got a life that has

521
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,829
nothing to prove that's got nothing to

522
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,829
prove anything

523
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,299
but that and that's the best part you're

524

hang out with him somebody made me proud

543
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:15,209
in my life the other day they said that

544
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:17,399
in DC that I was mobbed that people were

545
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,319
taking my picture and that he was

546
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,960
standing to the side and somebody said

547
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,649
to him when did you know gale was a rock

548
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,890
star and he said the day I married her

549
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,420
he's absolutely right I knew the moment

550
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,200
I met you he gave me a big old hug

551
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,029
it was like we'd known each other

552
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,410
forever yep yeah we'd been talking on

553
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,519
social media for so long it was just

554
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,170
like old friends that hadn't seen each

555
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,150
other in a while hey Mike what do you

556
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:43,259
think these three states that I've been

557
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,670
into Michigan California and DC what do

558
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,950
you think they're in store for with

559
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:51,539
legalization the long fight they're all

560
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,940
in different stages none of them

561
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:59,039
acquired obtained what yes

562
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:05,279
having I call it the Wild West Michigan

563
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:10,069
I went to a dispensary I walked in the

564
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:13,069
owner came out strapped smoking a blunt

565
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:13,069
around

566
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:21,299
that's 2009 right there 50 strains on

567
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,940
the shelf

568
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,000
none of them grown in his dispensary not

569
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,900
one hot one just buy it and flip it as

570
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,980
fast as I can

571
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:37,590
no edibles Colorado nowadays 100 plus or

572
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:42,450
minus plus or minus so you might be

573
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:43,649
getting 50 you might be getting every

574
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,539
state's gotta smell their own lab

575
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,780
testing infrastructure and that takes a

576
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,539
while

577
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:54,089
do you see doesn't have an industry

578
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:55,529
everything I found it doesn't surprise

579
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:58,980
me that there's a lot of out-of-state

580
00:22:55,529 --> 00:23:01,349
product goes straight to the East Coast

581
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,569
but they don't allow growing in DC right

582
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:05,549
like you got a car you can grow it but

583
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:07,950
you can't buy it but you can possess it

584
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:12,419
like Wyoming where you have to go out of

585
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,309
state to get it to possess it I don't

586
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,870
know the rules in each state but I think

587
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,099
the places we are not allowed to buy it

588
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,539
at a store and you're not allowed to

589
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:20,789
cultivate but you can have it I think

590
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,659
that's completely silly right you can't

591
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,730
sell it in DC it's all traded donated

592
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,100
but it was again it was like a flea

593
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,500
market at the National Mall washable on

594
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:34,829
the mall they're gonna really soon

595
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:38,730
because with legalization comes taxation

596
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:42,029
and regulation well the the DC I want to

597
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,420
say it's City Council is legally

598
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:48,089
prevented from spending money to draft

599
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:53,400
the rules for the legalization law that

600
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:55,889
the voters pass but the employees

601
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,780
working on marijuana stuff kind of like

602
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,560
at Wyoming

603
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,809
with the CBD the political rules in DC

604
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,639
are very odd they live in a tiny portion

605
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,009
of the country that's not like the rest

606
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,630
of the country and so some of the rules

607
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:12,319
and some of their rights are a little

608
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:16,370
bit different but they're so close to

609
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:19,220
like people from Maryland came people

610
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:23,049
from all these places outlying they all

611
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:25,549
came to buy their medicine there it's

612
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:27,769
it's weird game front like I'm from

613
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,359
Colorado and so to me to travel to

614
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,859
another state like that's something you

615
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,059
need to plan in pack a lunch for and

616
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,859
you've got to stop for gas a couple of

617
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:35,029
times before you get it done and there

618
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,649
are fully parts of the country on the

619
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:43,819
east coat that Gail's looking to be like

620
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:46,370
I just said I could fly know where these

621
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,869
borders are tiny it's like driving you

622
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:50,750
know ten blocks away you're in another

623
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:52,009
state yeah but you should still have it

624
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,630
available in your state this is why it

625
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,839
should be legal those invisible lines

626
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,790
should be yes and you just change how

627
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,339
you want it legal in each state like

628
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,589
alcohol yep like there can be a Utah of

629
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:06,109
pot where you have to join the bar as a

630
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:10,039
member to come in and pay your monthly

631
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:11,929
probably be Utah like at a church that's

632
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:16,549
how we run the church is kind of how

633
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:18,440
they run the yep bars and it works

634
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:21,139
there's no riffraff here get about

635
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,029
higher co2 standard as far as patrons

636
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,220
than any other Church I heard something

637
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:29,509
today on the news that just amazes me

638
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:37,039
and this is more government they just

639
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:48,230
released the first synthetic CBD why why

640
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:50,089
do we need CBD half of it is like it's

641
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,150
way easier to synthesize and then grow

642
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:55,970
to grow it you really need some Jeff and

643
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,790
they don't want that and that's why the

644
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,220
federal grow is so sad but I'm worried

645
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,829
that is what we have to keep fighting or

646
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,279
it will come to that yeah it's that's

647
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,859
what

648
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,960
is coming to and I'm like damn we fought

649
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,939
for this it's what we wanted but look at

650
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,670
the cost it was one of my biggest

651
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,279
frustrations in Colorado it's like the

652
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,320
last season a weed so when they take the

653
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,619
Big O garden and it's just chopped up

654
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,779
through a lab and put out in fields yeah

655
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,609
what's coming one of my biggest

656
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,299
disappointments in the community in

657
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:32,399
Colorado is we all took four years off

658
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:36,210
after legalization pass to celebrate and

659
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,160
enjoy and build an industry and like I

660
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,730
remember feeling like we won I remember

661
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,560
laying off and then I started seeing

662
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,910
that they were gonna get us through

663
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,829
zoning and they were gonna turn it just

664
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,230
back or back into exactly what we had

665
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:50,819
before legalization and start blocking

666
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,089
us and fighting us out and routing us

667
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:56,039
out that way and getting a vote for

668
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:58,949
legalization having that vote passing

669
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,809
that's the beginning like that's that's

670
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,279
just yeah that's like maybe the middle

671
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,589
of the beginning like you haven't

672
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,109
reached the middle yet or even come

673
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,549
close to the end the fight is long and

674
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:11,009
we all have to gear up for it and keep

675
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:14,399
it going I've been seeing where

676
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:17,910
Californians want to repeal 64 is that

677
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,190
an option I don't think so it would be

678
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,779
crazy hard to do but a lot of the people

679
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:26,490
in the black market or the gray market

680
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:28,470
have a vested interest against

681
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,509
legalization of course as soon as

682
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,250
legalization shows up the people that

683
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:34,980
have been doing it for 25 years in the

684
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,990
mountains are out unless what happened

685
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,640
here unless they can convert honestly

686
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:43,349
how many people couldn't convert here

687
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,060
everybody vent so I feel like everybody

688
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:46,799
that could grow that had heart for a

689
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,000
grow they got pushed out and all the

690
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,889
people that had a bunch of money they

691
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,599
took over and now they're hiring people

692
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,890
that have heart to grow and not paying

693
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,359
them worth of [ __ ] and they're kind of

694
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,280
ruining the industry yeah everything is

695
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,799
alarming audit products are subpar

696
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,779
because owners are from corporations and

697
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,490
they just want returned at large yes

698
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,319
they don't care about quality product

699
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,759
and then they hire a guy like me they're

700
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,470
just being hypothetical they can grow

701
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,329
[ __ ] his ass off and then they don't

702
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,100
give you the resources and they restrain

703
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,990
you and restrict you and that's what

704
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,230
this industry does I've consulted for a

705
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,980
couple of businesses now for years that

706
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,769
their problem is they will

707
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,740
invest in talent they keep hiring their

708
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:25,359
brother-in-law or their cousin or a guy

709
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,390
that came in and said he was a master

710
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:33,399
grower and was down for 13 an hour like

711
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:38,049
talent is what produces high quality

712
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,400
products talent skill and support and if

713
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:40,750
you don't have all three of those going

714
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,360
in your business you can't produce a

715
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,119
quality product but it you know I used

716
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,879
to when I first came into this scene I

717
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,918
really did believe it was patience over

718
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,270
profit I really did believe that I

719
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,630
thought oh yeah we're doing a great

720
00:28:52,269 --> 00:29:03,009
thing it is not that it is not that

721
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:04,630
anymore it is profit over anything model

722
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,009
is disappearing yeah the soul got sucked

723
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,290
out of this industry when it became

724
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,579
recreational legal creation illegal I

725
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,339
feel like that's when the soul got

726
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:14,470
ripped out of it one of the first things

727
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:17,470
kind of the stay in local governments

728
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:20,230
did was raise the bar of entry into the

729
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,690
industry first they said no felonies and

730
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:26,048
then okay no felonies for five years no

731
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,700
drug felonies for ten and so just with

732
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:29,139
every whack they could take they made it

733
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,590
harder and harder and harder for people

734
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,509
in the the industry before legalization

735
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:36,639
to participate in the industry after and

736
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,629
the hurdle that really fixed it was

737
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,429
saying all right

738
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,380
like in Aurora you need four hundred

739
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:43,720
thousand dollars just in a duffel bag in

740
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,210
a safe in the back of your store to

741
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,819
apply for a license you need to have

742
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,640
four hundred cash liquid on hand in case

743
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:53,349
you get sued or in case taxes come up

744
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,520
they wanted you to have that on hand

745
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:58,869
just webelo tried to bring it up and

746
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,089
when they added it to their list of

747
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:03,879
rules their reasoning for doing so was

748
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:06,189
well Aurora does it and when I pointed

749
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,410
out just City Council that we're not

750
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,029
allowed to use banks when we invest

751
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,700
money in this industry it has to come

752
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,319
from bank account in Colorado for money

753
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,569
generated in Colorado we have to

754
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,339
withdraw that as cash and then we can

755
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:21,220
invest it in the business requiring us

756
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:22,750
to have four hundred grand or and then

757
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,370
they lower well maybe we'll only do two

758
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,230
hundred here I was like even two hundred

759
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,579
grand you're requiring me to put 200

760
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,048
grand in a duffel bag and just keep that

761
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:30,519
in the bottom of the gun safe in the

762
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:31,420
back of my store like think about what

763
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,129
you're doing just

764
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,750
little bit super target they immediately

765
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,080
pulled that rag once they realized what

766
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:41,470
it meant but before I really like grab

767
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,879
them by the collar out and drag them to

768
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,769
reality

769
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,990
not all of them thought it was a great

770
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:49,569
idea because you know if we want

771
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,880
responsible business owners to be the

772
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:53,619
only people running these businesses no

773
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,540
responsible business owner should have a

774
00:30:53,619 --> 00:31:00,069
lot of money on hand just cash sound

775
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,930
like a drug dealer it sounds like a

776
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:04,029
wildly responsible business owner and

777
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,590
they did it because somebody else did it

778
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,240
yeah because somebody else did it it's

779
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:09,699
the same reason we have five nanograms

780
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,190
as the limit for your your blood draw in

781
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,319
Colorado five nanograms was what they

782
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,180
had in some other state and we were like

783
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,159
well Georgia does it in it's like well

784
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,680
they just picked the [ __ ] number like

785
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,330
there's no science do you think ever so

786
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,470
much they've got to be able to come up

787
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:27,009
with something they're not even allowed

788
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,750
to do the research right okay that's

789
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:31,720
that's how the web and I had this

790
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:34,210
conversation they could pull me over and

791
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,339
I'm always good I might not even have

792
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,890
smoked or consumed at all that day but

793
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:41,230
my blood is gonna say I'm high yes I

794
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:45,070
will I've been tested too and I was way

795
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:47,019
over five the next morning at 11:30 1400

796
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,299
or 14,000 whatever the test was they

797
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:51,099
could test for 1,400 or 14,000 nanograms

798
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,240
per particle or whatever this doctor

799
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,559
called me back and he's like you want a

800
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,819
prescription from Aaron all and I was

801
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,769
like no and he goes how did you do this

802
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,819
your blood your urine is as high as we

803
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:00,930
can test and I was like I've been

804
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,929
practicing for that test

805
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,390
he's like didn't you know you were

806
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,439
getting a test as like nope that [ __ ]

807
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,150
was a surprise

808
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,769
people like us when they say it takes 30

809
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,870
days for to clean your system out for a

810
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:13,089
drug test for us it takes months yeah I

811
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:18,039
win sixty three full days before I took

812
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:22,230
a pee test it still feels Josh had 72

813
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,230
days over there in the corner of flush I

852
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:45,279
you got a new car you're probably just

853
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,069
seeing how fast it goes let's not go so

854
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,710
fast today go wouldn't you say that

855
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:52,329
staying calm and being articulate goes a

856
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,009
long way yes

857
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:57,308
take off your sunglasses look them in

858
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:59,140
the eye call them sir yes sir no sir you

859
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:01,029
don't need to say a lot more no uh and

860
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,710
if you're in a place where cannabis is

861
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,720
legal and they ask you if you have

862
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,150
cannabis don't [ __ ] lie it's legal

863
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,949
there's no reason to lie when I said yes

864
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,179
I feel real the first time you do it

865
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,279
don't get me wrong that was the first

866
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,820
time I admitted yes sir I got weed in

867
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,290
the car

868
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,970

869
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:17,259
like I don't he knew like it was the

870
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,239
first time you ever said yes to that

871
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,710
question because his shoulders went down

872
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,000
and so did mine at the same time like

873

875
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,569

877
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,119
since I told him I had it he didn't go

878
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,710
through my car he didn't give me a

879
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,659
[ __ ] sobriety test he didn't [ __ ] me

880
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,519
worried about your weed yeah I had a

881
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:37,690

882
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,730

889
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,319
the smell we take home from the grow

890
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:55,358

00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,750
washer to dryer and I flipped that

892
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,500

and everyone and their gives you a dirty

897
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:13,460

898
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,809
at a restaurant in Springs and after we

899
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,400
it was a walk up in order and then you

900
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:19,190
go sit away in the eat your food at the

901
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,570

974
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:31,489
right well it's sitting on the table

975
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,800
granny's got the huge flame going on

976
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:36,529
granny can you teach us about insert

977
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,599
dabs granny's gonna do an insert dab I

978
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,730
will discuss this freaks me out earlier

979
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,500
I had to ask questions so

980
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,940
well I talked about dabs a lot on the

981
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,739
show and I try to keep people updated on

982
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,950
what's going on the new way that we're

983
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:52,289
dabbing to use a banger it looks a lot

984
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:56,849
like the old banger but it's bigger it's

985
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:59,309
much wider so it is use a small I like a

986
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,289
small rig a small bubbler then this

987
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:03,059
piece fits where your bowl would go it

988
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,739
is comes up at a 90 degree angle then it

989
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:06,029
looks like it's got a giant glass symbol

990
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:07,139
on it to tell you the truth and granny

991
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,960
is about to burn her arm with it there

992
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:12,420
we go that was damn near a dad brand

993
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,389
yeah it's got a giant symbol and then

994
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,400
there is a smaller thimble you take the

995
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:18,900
smaller glass thimble and you load it

996
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,910
with your dab granny's put a nice tab

997
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,519
with this Charlie Sheen og in there like

998
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:25,769
a nice little insert you dropped that

999
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,250
one piece of glass into the other piece

1000
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:30,780
like it's hot so you got one piece of

1001
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,550
glass that you heat then you put your

1002
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,080
dab inside of another you drop it in

1003
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,330
there then you put a carbon cap on it

1004
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,279
you want that bubble cap I think yes you

1005
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:42,690
need a bubble cap you need a nice bubble

1006
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,490
rotation as soon as it starts bubbling

1007
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,470
granny starts dabbing it and smoking it

1008
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:48,689
now you're gonna say that sounds like a

1009
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:53,429
lot of [ __ ] work you're not wrong

1010
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:55,079
it's it's really yeah it is a little

1011
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:56,879
extra work but I like the ritual it

1012
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,039
gives me one more step to participate in

1013
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,130
my dab smoking maybe it'll slow me down

1014
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,690
one little step that's one of the things

1015
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:08,640
we have in common we both enjoy the

1016
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:10,320
ritual taking a DAB and doing it just

1017
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,239
feels nice one more thing is beautiful

1018
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,190
that's why I don't like an email there's

1019
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,769
no ritual all right I can agree with

1020
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,869
that but now the reason for the insert

1021
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:21,179
dab it's so much easier to pull that

1022
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:22,619
little insert out of there and drop that

1023
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:24,719
into the cup of alcohol that she brought

1024
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,849
to clean it up and then now it's fresh

1025
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,409
and clean the Scourge part of the dab

1026
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,569
didn't just burn the inside of her nail

1027
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:32,879
my nail is black and funky it tastes

1028
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,940
like poop her dad tastes like turps and

1029
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,369
fresh and there we go on I did one the

1030
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,599
other night always 2 minutes and 27

1031
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,710
seconds ago with it though it's not

1032
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,449
required because she's got multiple

1033
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,679
inserts and you could clean them off if

1034
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:48,839
there's any rolls and stuff

1035
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,500
granny granny is a spoiled Hache brat

1036
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,720
and I'm all about it I'm very spoiled

1037
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,059
and I I thank the powers that be every

1038
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,219
day that I live in this life I do not

1039
00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:00,230
take it for granted we're smoking the

1040
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,569
best ash on the planet in a cannabis

1041
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,059
Church in Colorado Springs with our best

1042
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,320
friends burger and a milkshake I'd never

1043
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,299
lose we're gonna do that when we leave

1044
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,289
so don't worry I would never leave

1045
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:15,349
I think the chairs are comfortable the

1046
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:16,219
people are good so this is a good call

1047
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,640
grannies thanks for putting this

1048
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,409
together

1049
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,118
insert dad you guys if you're trying to

1050
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,019
up your your dad level I was wondering

1051
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,400
how you're gonna get that out of there

1052
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,019
she brings little tweezers with yes

1053
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,170
she's got the whole kid it's beautiful

1054
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,750
whole set up they're not little tweezers

1055
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:35,030
these look like they're the size of like

1056
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:38,300
a heavy-duty letter opener yes yes and

1057
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,769
she's got a jar of its ISO but it's

1058
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,670
starting to look like cannabis moonshine

1059
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:45,619
at this point it was clean when we

1060
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,059
started well just kind of color to it

1061
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,980
now it's kind of look like a piece was

1062
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:51,108
crystal clear it looked like water for a

1063
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,119
second I thought it was shine when I

1064
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:55,429
first saw it I realized quickly that's a

1065
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,380
jar of alcohol granny's gonna keep your

1066

1143
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:23,259
the steps in the correct order okay will

1144
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,840
you teach us about I will so they didn't

1145
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,640
have a bong so I had to get out of a

1146
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,530
spoon Bowl but normally it'd be a bong

1147
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:31,539
it would be a bong a do a bong rip and

1148
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:35,170
then I threw back that shot of hennessey

1149
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:37,869
and what would your normal shot be she's

1150
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,760
still holding the pipe rip yeah take a

1151
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,889
take a rip hold it in then do the shot

1152
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,680
yes then I take the shot usually it'll

1153
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:46,449
be like one of them fruity like they're

1154
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:49,449
kind of like wine cooler shots because

1155
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:52,779
when I equivocate them I can't even talk

1156
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:57,059
but there's your fruity shot 150 we're

1157
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:59,620
called porn stars and it's it's like

1158
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:04,299
raspberry vodka it's not very strong

1159
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:08,469
could you just get a stream so then I

1160
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:11,500
take the shot then I do a DAB and then I

1161
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:16,959
chug a beer a pint of beer and then I

1162
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:19,179
exhale so I did that on Rico show but

1163
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,030
then I went back and did another dab and

1164
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:24,029
then I just drank out of the Hennessy

1165

as long as I've known you you've never

1269
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:13,009
lost your passion for cannabis there's

1270
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,559
always something new to spark it in me

1271
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,210
it started to kind of I got overwhelmed

1272
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,889
with this with these grows and then they

1273
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,119
gave me a brand new one look at all

1274
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:21,859
these new lights you get in all these

1275
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:23,750
new tables and this new irrigation and

1276
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,420
they brought me new strains and work

1277
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:29,300
it's working you still have compassion

1278
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,190

1279
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,840
without cannabis what would I be a

1280
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,849
musician and it wouldn't be a happy life

1281
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,620
that'd be on the road I'd be on the road

1282
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:38,059
addicted to drugs that's not a future

1283

00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:49,629
teenagers back together

1288
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,769
teenagers okay

1289
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:56,000
so write it right is there truly broken

1290
00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:57,409
and then you get to try to learn the

1291
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,820
hard way that that's way too late to

1292
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:00,519
intervene yeah I've got a 15 year old

1293
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,720
girl and I was gonna say that's they're

1294
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,550
not gonna change anything about them

1295
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,129
after that when I went worked with the

1296
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,930
the much younger kids the five six seven

1297
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,599
year olds in social service care Dave

1298
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:13,250
Blake broke my psyche like that's why I

1299
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,170
was [ __ ] up when we met

1300
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,210
it was cuz I was still coming off that

1301
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:19,250
job and hadn't recovered yet no I don't

1302
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:21,170
think I could deal with that yes no it's

1303
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,429
everyday they'd be like here there's a

1304
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,809
new kid coming in and then they would

1305
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:25,879
hand you a notebook with the world's

1306
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:27,619
most horrible story in it and that

1307
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,010
happened like twice a week for three

1308
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:30,949
years

1309
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:32,690
that's like emotionally that's more than

1310
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:34,579
one person even think about it in

1311
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:38,619
serious terms and I don't like to draw

1312
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:38,619
your eye look like you're distant yeah

1313
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:53,570
job for surely can I had my aunt was a

1314
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:56,240
social worker in Cedar Rapids Iowa and

1315
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:59,690
she loved it it was her passion but I

1316
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:01,879
was like that's too emotional for me I

1317
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:04,099
can't deal with that the only positive

1318
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,590
part was working with the older kids was

1319
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:08,299
I had a little bit of an ability to yank

1320
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:10,820
the occasional kid out of the meat

1321
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,730
grinder before the system fully treat

1322
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,470
them to death but once I went to work

1323
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:19,159
with the younger kids just like that

1324
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:21,349
level of [ __ ] up at this yeah it's

1325
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:24,259
just it takes a certain type of person

1326
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:26,089
who's just left yep

1327
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,500
well you have to roll with it and then

1328
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,420
you've got to do like therapy sessions

1329
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,179
with the family and it's just seriously

1330
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:37,400
I didn't have them invested nope yeah

1331
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:39,049
way too young for that yeah because it's

1332
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,579
so underfunded they can't afford people

1333
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,320
who actually know what they're doing or

1334
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:43,880
care so me right out of college they

1335
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:49,120
were like here's a bunch of gang kids

1336
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:52,309
good luck good yo yeah wait Mike

1337
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,960
take care all these gang kids do you

1338
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:55,279
guys feel that I'm just asking because I

1339
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,869
am definitely doing this do you guys

1340
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,000
feel like you go through phases where

1341
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:00,529
sometimes you can smoke all the hash and

1342
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,360
you don't get properly medicated or high

1343
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,100
enough for where you want to be within

1344
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,570
like four or five days later you'll open

1345
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:08,000
up your jar and you'll try to take it

1346
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:10,610
dab in as soon as you hit it so I'm so

1347
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,190
high and it'll last for maybe an hour

1348
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,750
yeah yeah yeah I'm going through into

1349
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,579
those phases where just little tiny dads

1350
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,780
have just been wrecking me I'm not

1351
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,179
complaining I just wondered if other

1352
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,010
people experienced it did you have you

1353
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:24,679
taken a tolerance break or anything I

1354
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:26,840
don't do that Gail neither I feel like I

1355
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:29,269
had a natural pass dr. weir

1356
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,800
talking about things like that it's dive

1357
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:32,000
stomach problems and stuff they were

1358
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,590
just talking they're a friend of mine

1359
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,150
and they actually ran the holistic

1360
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,070
clinic in the town I'm from she's past

1361
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,780
now so this is a long time ago but uh

1362
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,890
we're talking and she's like so what are

1363
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,570
you doing for that stomach pain and

1364
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:43,909
stuff and I was gonna just smoke like

1365
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:45,559
this much hash and I do this and she's

1366
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:47,000
like you better not ever stop smoking

1367
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:51,489
cuz if you do whatever is really wrong

1368
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,489
with you is gonna show I believe that

1369
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,090
cannabis is what's keeping him alive and

1370
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:04,670
that's been true for like 25 years

1371
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:07,430
and I would myself they the doctors that

1372
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:09,590
he's working with convinced him to get

1373
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:11,690
off cannabis completely it just like

1374
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:15,019
give it 30 days old man see what happens

1375
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:18,260
and he did it and on day 15 they were

1376
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:21,650
like please for the love of God go smoke

1377
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,830
a joint like you're gonna die Jeff do

1378
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:27,410
you take CBD on the Reg - I do not take

1379
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:29,599
CBD I don't like the way CBD makes me

1380
00:56:27,409 --> 00:56:31,549
feel CBD got me through my head injury

1381
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,289
at certain times and then I feel like

1382
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,120
once I got past a certain point with the

1383
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:37,429
head injury the CBD wasn't doing what I

1384
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,859
wanted it to were you only smoking it or

1385
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:43,789
were using identity I was taking pills

1386
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:45,170
and I was smoking dabs of it I had when

1387
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:47,690
I first hit my head it felt like I had

1388
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:49,159
so you guys just a just a reminder or

1389
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,440
update or whatever I had a traumatic

1390
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:54,429
brain injury in April of back in the day

1391
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,429
it was a couple years ago

1392
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,590
in a doorway a low doorway I got the low

1393
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:02,150
doorway knocked myself clean at the top

1394
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,380
of some stairs knocked myself out fell

1395
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,550
down the stairs woke up at the bottom of

1396
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,990
the stairs a couple friends were pulling

1397
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,830
me up the stairs had a traumatic brain

1398
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,769
injury

1399
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:12,380
I'm subdural hematoma and I'm treated

1400
00:57:09,769 --> 00:57:17,239
well let's let's move forward Mike I had

1401
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:18,980
a few problems but anyway my head hurt

1402
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:23,119
[ __ ] bad and I was at Maddy and

1403
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:25,219
Spence's house and Spitz was making CBD

1404
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,869
concentrates for a cannabis cup and he's

1405
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:30,439
like dog you need that CBD and I was

1406
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:32,089
like sure it's the stuff that ended up

1407
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,280
winning the Cup so I took a couple of

1408
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,750
big dabs of that and each dab felt it

1409
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,190
felt like I had a belt too tight around

1410
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,659
my head like you'd put a belt around my

1411
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,659
head and stomped on it and tried to get

1412
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:42,029
a ratchet clam

1413
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,409
and when I took that CBD dad it feel

1414
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,240
like you just took it off half a notch

1415
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:46,649
and everybody in the room could see a

1416
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,539
difference in me maddie was like are you

1417
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,340
feeling better and I was like dude I'm

1418
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,989
coming back cuz when I hit my head I

1419
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,670
knocked the [ __ ] out of myself I

1420
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:55,799
couldn't do math like I'm not even

1421
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:58,079
kidding I couldn't do math probably

1422
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,480
couldn't remember simple words like the

1423
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,480
and I could but instead I would say

1424
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,159
pickle or like yeah yeah I had really

1425
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,719
weird symptoms I had other physical

1426
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:08,429
symptoms I talked about my nervous boner

1427
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,279
I would get a raging erection for no

1428
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:13,469
reason if I got nervous or anxious just

1429
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,530
get a huge boner which would just make

1430
00:58:13,469 --> 00:58:17,819
me more uncomfortable have an adult I

1431
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,430
can't have a boner in public that's

1432
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,780
[ __ ] horrible but so I smoked then

1433
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:23,460
Spence was like Dawg you need more of

1434
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,320
the CBD we can see a difference in you

1435
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,090
so I was smoking the CBD with Spence and

1436
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,920
he gave me a little bit of it and it got

1437
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,960
me through it and then I got past the

1438
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,550
dark times I call it of my head injury

1439
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,079
there were terrible things going through

1440
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,190
my mind I didn't know that I was gonna

1441
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,230
make it through that if I didn't have

1442
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,119
friends like Mike and a few other people

1443
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,490
that were around my mom probably granny

1444
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,839
a few other people that took good care

1445
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:44,129
of me and they knew I had a brain injury

1446
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,019
that would if I started saying weird

1447
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:47,250
[ __ ] they just come hang out and I'd be

1448
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:48,750
like it's like 3:00 in the morning why

1449
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,579
are you still here it's cool bro I'm

1450
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,690
just gonna hang out I'm talking strange

1451
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:53,309
or something's going on I could tell

1452
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,720
that that's why they're here but I

1453
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:57,480
wasn't cognizant to figure out exactly

1454
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,769
why but I knew I was like subconscious

1455
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,030
is like you're just keeping it I mean he

1456
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,920
do you think I might hurt myself or my

1457
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,480
trying to microwave the batteries or

1458
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,360
something I don't know because I was

1459
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,280
doing weird and saying weird [ __ ] so

1460
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,289
eventually the CBD got me through the

1461
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,990
dark times and I realized that the high

1462
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:16,769
THC was what I needed now cuz the pain

1463
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:18,509
was gone the thoughts scrambling and the

1464
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:20,849
word disassociation so you guys I

1465
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,770
clearly was asking my mom to pass me a

1466
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:24,569
banana to put in a smoothie and I kept

1467
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:26,550
calling it a [ __ ] burrito and was

1468
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,110
getting angry at my mom forget him

1469
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,430
understand what you were give me the

1470
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,200
goddamn burrito she's like there's not a

1471
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:32,969
burrito over here I'm [ __ ] pointing

1472
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,259
at a burrito mom I want that burrito why

1473
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,000
are you [ __ ] with me is making me

1474
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,500
really mad like why would my mom do this

1475
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,550
to me I want that burrito I can see it I

1476
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,920
want to touch I want to eat it

1477
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:42,539
I meant banana she was really having my

1478
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,250
back so things were weird but that was

1479
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:47,250
coming back all my my signals were going

1480
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:48,900
to the right path but my thoughts would

1481
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,400
I don't know they would scatter it would

1482
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,809
feel like I got a filing cabinet in my

1483
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,740
brain and somebody just dumped out the

1484
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:53,820
files and they were still

1485
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:55,049
there I just couldn't get to him as

1486
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,970
quickly I'd be like oh you want to know

1487
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,200
my name hold on and I'd have to shuffle

1488
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:00,000
through all the papers and then we'd

1489
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,909
find it here's my birthday I know what

1490
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,469
it is I can tell you then I started

1491
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:05,639
smoking the high THC stuff and it

1492
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:07,379
started putting it back together the

1493
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:09,659
puzzle pieces when I start getting that

1494
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:12,590
like I can't remember [ __ ] the high THC

1495
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:15,539
the limonene and T you still get that I

1496
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:17,700
don't know because I stay so long I

1497
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:19,320
don't know I had brain farts before I

1498
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:21,089
hit my head I'm trying to think too many

1499
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,930
things I'm responsible for 15 employees

1500
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:27,200
to grows a daughter the friends whatever

1501
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:29,639
else Facebook Instagram Twitter podcast

1502
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:31,079
driving putting on my shoes you know I

1503
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:32,509
got so many things there's gonna be a

1504
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,500
[ __ ] brain fart in there somewhere I

1505
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,330
think I can tell the difference between

1506
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,920
the brain injury brain farts and the

1507
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:39,449
natural you're just thinking too many

1508
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,760
things or you had too many tabs brain

1509
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:44,719
farts so now what does the CBD do make

1510
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,160
you feel like it makes me

1511
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,289
Gumby like it makes me not feel like

1512
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,059
I've got complete control of my fingers

1513
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:52,199
in my hands like if I go to try to you

1514
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:53,759
ever been in the cold and your thumbs

1515
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:55,169
are too cold and you have texts that's

1516
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,000
what CBD does to my thumbs

1517
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:59,460
I just I feel like I'm missing instead

1518
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,650
I'm hitting the Pete that's strange yeah

1519
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,320
yeah it just makes my my dexterity goes

1520
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,970
funky but and so I don't smoke it when

1521
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,250
people like this is mad CBD I'm like oh

1522
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:10,019
give that to granny who it works for or

1523
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,358
Mike who it works for because it's a

1524
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:13,139
waste on me it just doesn't do what I

1525
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,108
want it to do

1526
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:19,199
we're on tinctures and it ruins my THC

1527
01:01:16,108 --> 01:01:21,150
high if I get it takes me because it

1528
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,059
takes me a little bit I'm medicating I'm

1529
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:25,619
not smoking the first three dads are

1530
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,269
medicine the fourth and fifth one that's

1531
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:28,320
probably recreational but it takes me a

1532
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:30,929
minute to get where I need to be

1533
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,340
medicinally I got a smoke to get my to

1534
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:34,589
build it up it's like if you take

1535
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,510
whatever 250 milligram pills I got to

1536
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,490
get my 250 milligrams or whatever in my

1537
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:40,980
body by consuming it before I start I

1538
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:44,939
would like to dab yeah just go in just

1539
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:48,150
beautiful and I don't want to [ __ ] that

1540
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,289
up with CBD I don't want to just I I run

1541
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,809
into that all the time because I eat a

1542
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:54,239
lot of well not a lot for the people at

1543
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:56,880
this table but a lot for civilians CBD

1544
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,469
every day and if I've been hurting all

1545
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,269
day and we've been running around really

1546
01:01:58,469 --> 01:02:04,099
hard and like my knees my harvest 165

1547
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:07,340
plants

1548
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:10,039
in one day on days like that I'll end up

1549
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:13,490
consuming four or five times the normal

1550
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:17,119
amount of CBD THC pills that I normally

1551
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:17,329
take and those days when I go home all

1552
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,489
right

1553
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:23,449
end of the day kids asleep wanna relax

1554
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:26,199
want to get a nice buzz going I'll take

1555
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:29,569
four or five bong hits and I Mike's

1556
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:31,879
Sobers judge yep give it a couple of

1557
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,380
minutes take a DAB give it a couple

1558
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,820
minutes we'll call for a couple minutes

1559
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:39,800
Mike likes to cough and then I'll start

1560
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,170
to get to where I want to be but on days

1561
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,850
where I haven't been earning and it's

1562
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,039
been office work all day maybe I didn't

1563
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:47,869
even take a pill that day I get home for

1564
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:49,099
that first bong grant puts me halfway to

1565
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:53,000
the where I want to be it's so much

1566
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:55,159
quicker I just think we really need CBD

1567
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,360
I take picture every morning I don't

1568
01:02:55,159 --> 01:03:00,379
smoke it anymore but I feel like it's uh

1569
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,269
what's the drug they give you when

1570
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,119
you're it's like noir can to your heroin

1571
01:03:02,269 --> 01:03:07,309
it's like it's the same thing for my THC

1572
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,380
CBD rescue pills for people who weigh

1573
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:11,570
over consume yeah yeah I don't want that

1574
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:13,940
I spend so much time and money trying to

1575
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:15,470
consume all this THC yeah but don't you

1576
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,119
believe like if you take a tincture in

1577
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:19,309
the morning that's not like smoking it

1578
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,980
yes smoking it is going to do something

1579
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:24,820
different I don't know I should try I

1580
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:28,010
just don't feel like I go the other way

1581
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,530
well I'll give you a success story I

1582
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:33,620
would love to hear it Kevin's been taken

1583
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:37,850
off the transplant list fixed himself

1584
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:39,170
with CBD Eights do you mind telling more

1585
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:40,460
a little backup story about what he was

1586
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,320
gonna have transplanted and what do you

1587
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,190
have cured with don't go too far that

1588
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:49,269
you're not comfortable I wouldn't ask

1589
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:52,389
for too much details in 93 different

1590
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:55,940
treatments to try to rid them of it

1591
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:59,900
every treatment gave him worse symptoms

1592
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:01,119
you never got rid of the hepatitis C put

1593
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:06,829
them in

1594
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:09,769
cirrhosis of the liver finally in 2011

1595
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:11,989
they put him on a new experimental drug

1596
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:17,449
what you see on TV now it's called

1597
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:19,368
harvoni it rid him of hepatitis C but

1598
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:22,309
there was so much damage done to his

1599
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:24,980
liver that he had been listed for a

1600
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:26,929
transplant for a liver but he was also

1601
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,730
on so many other drugs because of all

1602
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,519
the other symptoms that come along with

1603
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:33,949
that that's how he became that opioid

1604
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:35,780
zombie once we got him off all the

1605
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:38,599
opioids and he started coming around

1606
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:41,359
like a normal human being again started

1607
