56
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,469
the dispensary less and less during the

57
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,629
kovat times I don't need to go expose

58
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,609
myself and put the bud tenders at risk

59
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,228
extra times but they limit us on

60
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,420

me to talk to extra 40 minutes instead

189

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,790
the way home and on the way back yeah

191
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,139

192
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,550
have to drive home after being here for

193
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,539
two hours taking dabs with me you could

194
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,910
take that big if you would have taken

195
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,080
that dab you just took at my house I'd

have been like well he's not leaving for

197
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,569

199
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,769

everybody for all of the video feedback

202
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,800
I loved doing the video I thought it

203
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,060
would be a lot more work now that I've

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,590
gotten a little more comfortable with

205
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,930
the editing and I understand how to do

206
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,969
it what my goal is if I would just stop

207
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,889
trying to make fancy subtitles and intro

208
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,870
screens and outro videos the shoot would

209
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,149
take way less time but I'm getting good

210
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,740

268
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,028
few select females one of those females

269
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:01,220

270
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:02,778
we can make f2 seeds that way we can

271
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,278

289
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:39,229
the chat run the show they type in

290
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,429
comments I answer their questions as

291
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,930

296
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,540
chat

297
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,028
Tyler heard me mention that I am

298
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:54,500
breeding to the Jack the Ripper and

299
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:56,509
Tyler is excited to get some of the f

300
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,509
ones and possibly the f2 s that come

301
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:04,009
from that project when I mentioned this

302
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:08,389
idea on that live chat my phone started

303
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:10,100
vibrating across the table I had to

304
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:13,429
chase it down like it was a dog getting

305
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:17,210
out of my [ __ ] control the plants are

306
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:20,599
in veg like they're in vet first round

307
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,629
of seeds are in veg yeah yeah they

308
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,950
haven't the nobody maybe one of me

309
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,689
wanted to of the Jack the Ripper

310
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,430
seedlings has kind of shown sex but

311
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,800
that's all we've gotten so far they're

312
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:33,019
not even in flower so I need 70 days to

313
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,879
flower them approximately you know 60 70

314
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:39,169
75 depends on what they do

315
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,419
ah then we've got two Oscars round one

316
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:43,309
that's them yeah that's phase one round

317
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,779
one and then we will grow out some of

318
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,519
the seeds and see if they were worth the

319
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,500
[ __ ] to even make and then if they were

320
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,208
then we'll send a few of them out to

321
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,339
some of our friends maybe this person

322
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,079
here since they've been such a long time

323
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,450
patreon helper we may let them be a

324
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,730
tester of the first batch but they've

325
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,320
got to grow they've got to be harvested

326
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,450
they've got to be taken from the plants

327
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,800
they've got to be counted and put into a

328
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,350
little spreadsheet so I know how many

329
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,089
seeds I've got then they're gonna get

330
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,590
I'm into Germany I'm gonna put about a

331
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,030
hundred of them in a container and

332
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,860
germinate them and count how many of

333
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,939
them do not pop and if we don't get at

334
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,740
least a solid number

335
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,660
I won't even send them out two testers

336
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,250
if we get a solid number I'll grow a

337
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:20,870
bunch of them the testers will grow up

338
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,940
bunch of them once the testers show me

339
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,409
they're reliable then we can think about

340
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,380
putting them to market so you're looking

341
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,730
at ah 70 days for them to flower from

342
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,009
the day I put them into flower which I

343
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,920
don't expect to do so for about 14 more

344
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:38,090
days so 84 days before they're even done

345
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:40,039
10 days to dry 94 days 6 days for me to

346
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,480
[ __ ] around because sometimes I get

347
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,490
thrown off schedule there's a hundred

348
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,779
days before we can even think about the

349
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:52,820
first batch of seeds being touched

350
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:56,419
that's Halloween now that's just that no

351
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:59,240
one realizes how fast this this takes I

352
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:00,889
won't have the first batch of finished

353
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,870
flower while that lightning was so

354
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,819
bright it made me blink indoors I don't

355
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,019
know if it was bright I don't know if

356
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,910
that came up on the camera but that

357
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:10,250
vibrated my whole chair that was amazing

358
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:15,319
I won't have the first batch of seeds

359
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:17,269
flowered until around spring of 2021 the

360
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,129
cool mics across town for me and that

361
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,019
Thunder took a [ __ ] couple of miles

362
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,850
to travel as pretty good I won't have

363
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:25,250
these seeds flowered out until spring of

364
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,790
2021 is basically where we are

365

Valentine's Day March April ich of 2021

366
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,750

367
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,029

recommend the same same strains all the

490
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,250
time but for a beginning grower if you

491
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,519
want feminized seeds I would definitely

492
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,440
recommend the orange gasm orange gasm is

493
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,750
a champion it's very forgiving it

494
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,430
doesn't take very long to grow well

495
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,309
everybody loves that a citrus turb -

496
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:03,259
everybody loves that citrus listening to

497
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,759

498
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,879
would be like well what Terp are you in

499
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:10,609

501
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,418
the orange gasm is a nice sort of

502
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,750
wheelhouse one that's the orange strip

503
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,490
is just real smooth it's not too intense

504
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,338
it's always a favorite it's super easy

505
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,009
to grow and the buzz from it is really

506
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:27,078
nice it's like good smile it's like all

507
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,549
day long cannabis you can smoke it all

508
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:30,859
day if you smoke it right when you get

509
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,329
up your smile in and you're bouncing if

510
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:33,589
you smoke it right after lunch you're

511
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,359
ready to go back to work and if your job

512
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,069
sucks who cares I just smoked some

513
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,079
orange gasm I'm in a good [ __ ] mood

514
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,789
if it's evening time I want to chill on

515
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,349
watch a movie chill out watch a movie

516
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,918
smoke some orange gasm it'll put a smile

517
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,769
on your face

518
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,490
smoke it before bed and I get the best

519
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,440
like colorful car

520
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,000
toon Simpsons II looking [ __ ] dreams

521
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,640
it is so amazing

522
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,440
yeah so I would recommend orange gasm to

523
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,460
start that's a feminized strain it's

524
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,830
really easy to grow

525
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,269
you'll get short flowering phenotype so

526
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,589
get eight and nine week flowering

527
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,049
phenotypes in there that doesn't take

528
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:07,709
super long ah the less time the less

529
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,329
opportunity to [ __ ] things up um also it

530
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,890
smells and tastes and smokes amazing

531
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:13,470
makes great concentrates you'll get good

532
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,030
harvests good smoke good Terps I think

533
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,130
it's an all-around champion now if you

534
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:20,549
want to expand and do something non

535
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,260
feminized I would recommend the prana or

536
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:25,200
the morning dude those are both really

537
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,019
easy for beginners the prana is super

538
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,759
vigorous really easy to grow again it

539
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,379
doesn't take super long to flower it's

540
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,490
got a really nice buzz to it really

541
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,320
unique funky ah hippy stanky feet kind

542
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,120
of aroma is really unique flavors and

543
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,439
aromas when people grow prana they're

544
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,029
always like what why those bright

545
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,140
lightning when people grow prana they're

546
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:45,808
always like what do you call these weird

547
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,780
smells I say it smells like the the

548
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:49,859
hindu shop on Mastry or on ah that big

549
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,420
street I can't think of a name the

550
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,519
street in Massachusetts Newbury Street

551
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,080
and masts exactly what it smelled like

552
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,269
when I walked in their feet and curry

553
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,428
and like incense and weirdness

554
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,529
it was delicious but that strange smells

555
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,590
unique so the prana or the morning dew

556
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:07,019
the morning dew is an SF o G an SF e o G

557
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:09,689
chem 91 cross with some other stuff in

558
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,639
there ah it's true the arise so the

559
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,350
morning dew you are given - yeah it's

560
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,940
really easy to grow you can beat the

561
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:18,389
[ __ ] out of it and you'll get good

562
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,610
harvests and lots of gassy uh earthy

563
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,870
berry kind of funky Terps come out of

564
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:24,089
that one and good colors to it you're

565
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,439
trying to take photography that morning

566
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,480
dew will give you some awesome colors

567
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,009
and so well so will the prana so those

568
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,620
are three great recommendations for you

569
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:33,990
also anything from the turtles line any

570
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,729
of the turtles will grow well the three

571
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,500
bad guys don't grow as easily the

572
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,089
shredder grows really well bebop and

573
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,240
rocksteady are more challenging the for

574
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:44,819
TMNT crosses will grow like a champ very

575
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,769
similarly to that orange gasm hey that

576
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,450
was a great message they did not include

577
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,400
their name and their email so I'm not

578
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,170
gonna say it they know who they are big

579
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,150
thanks I do appreciate the wonderful

580
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,679
email and let me know when you get some

581
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,990
seeds I want to know what you selected

582
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,040
and also I want to see pictures of the

583
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,900
grow as things progress

584
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,000
I love seeing photo

585
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,370
of my seedlings turning into giant

586
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,140
plants and a giant colas and then he see

587
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,750
him turn into [ __ ] concentrates I

588
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,850
love seeing the progress oh yeah keep us

589
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,589
updated folks all right we've been gone

590
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,469
for a minute I think I'm going to move

591
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,970
to this other message right here Mike

592
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,250
and I kind of talked about this one for

593
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,450
a brief moment before the show looking

594
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,500
to see how long we've been going we've

595
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,250
been going for 20 minutes okay um okay

596
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,720
yeah sorry I can't read my own

597
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,730
handwriting I was really confused

598
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,360
that's a three that's a five that means

599
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,890
20 minutes okay this message says this

600
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,509
one comes from patreon also if you'd

601
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,940
like to help us out on patreon is

602
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:42,029
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

603
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,840
heart it goes a lot like this uh hey

604
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,609
Rasta Jeff

605
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,099
it says I'm doing some research about

606
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:48,719
all this stuff and I'm growing in a four

607
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,000
part recirculating deep water culture

608
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,829
system which I bill that goes on a lot

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,839
talks about deep water culture drilled

610
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:56,759
the holes keeping the water levels

611
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,379
correct here's the part we need to get

612
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,420
to it says I'm using 8 nap pots and I

613
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,270
also have RO water but I can use a

614
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,279
mixture of RO and SAP water if my tap

615
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,679
water is good so they're basically

616
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,450
asking they've got access to RO water

617
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,370
they've also got regular tap water

618
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,319
they're asking basically it's a really

619
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,609
long message with a lot of it's hard to

620
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,409
read to tell you the truth I think they

621
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:19,049
were driving and typing but thanks for

622
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,580
the message um they've got RO water and

623
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,480
they've got tap water they're asking if

624
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:26,460
they can mix the RO and the tap water ah

625
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,579
you could but that would be like

626
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,490
cleaning your water and then dumping it

627
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,269
back in with dirty water and having kind

628
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,029
of clean water

629
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:37,470
you already did work and RO water you

630
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:39,389
waste a lot of stuff and you're using

631
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,240
filters and membranes and electricity

632
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,880
and time so either do or don't would

633
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,549
kind of be my opinion I'm not sure the

634
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,770
reasoning for wanting to do both

635
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:54,450
yeah I definitely if you've got our old

636
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:56,009
water I'm I use it or don't ya RO water

637
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,529
can be a little bit more challenging to

638
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,240
buffer when it comes to pH getting the

639
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,410
pH accurate is a little bit more

640
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,230
challenging there's nothing in there to

641
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,910
keep it stabilized the I've seen more

642
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,250
disconnected RO systems than I've seen

643
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,750
operational RO systems that was

644
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,579
something I was gonna add to the sort of

645
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,170
the end of that but that is true not to

646
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,629
be a dick about it but that's just my

647
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,279
personal experience if you have got good

648
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,140
tap water the way to find out you've got

649
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,420
good tap water is to run some tests on

650
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,490
it run an EC test on the run a ppm test

651
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,990
on there if the numbers are acceptable

652
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,660
you've got good water if something seems

653
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,819
higher than it should be maybe go to the

654
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,259
local water company's website and see

655
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,700
exactly what they're adding into the

656
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,839
water there will be a chart that shows

657
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,000
what they're putting in your local

658
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,679
municipal water and you can find out do

659
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,619
I need to work on removing things in

660
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,690
most cases I know that I'm generalizing

661
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,309
but in most places if you can drink the

662
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,350
water without making a funky face it

663
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,359
will probably be okay for the plants I

664
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:49,919
can't guarantee that there are there's

665
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:51,629
Flint Michigan people are gonna say what

666
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,300
about Flint I said if you can drink it

667
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,910
without making a funky face so if your

668
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,309
tap water is good use the tap water in a

669
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,620
commercial environment in most cases I

670
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,440
do not use RO because it is harder for

671
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:07,379
the crew to adjust the pH once we mix I

672
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,000
do use a big boy filter the big boy

673
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,620
filter takes out most of the stuff that

674
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,849
I'm worried about and there is not

675
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:17,069
nearly as much waste so um I would not

676
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:19,259
recommend mixing the water that's like

677
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:20,879
um I don't even know I don't have a good

678
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,619
an ounce oh you're gonna clean water and

679
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,350
then pour it back in with the not clean

680
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:27,329
water so you're gonna get either semi

681
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,519
clean or semi dirty water depending on

682
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:33,179
how optimistic or pessimistic you are at

683
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,920
that point right yeah yeah I mean

684
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,590
definitely one or the other if you ask

685
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,330
me for sure when you when we went over

686
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:43,789
talked about this email originally the

687
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:46,980
that question struck me is particularly

688
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,879
odd yeah I agree with you that's why we

689
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,380
addressed that one here at the end so um

690
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,660
and pick one one or the other I don't

691
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,060
see a reason unless your water is bad I

692
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,769
don't see a reason to use the RO if your

693
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,779
water is good use that tap water unless

694
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,970
you really want to be super in control

695
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,740
it is fun to see exactly what you're

696
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,809
putting in there but it is not necessary

697
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,370
maybe do I don't know how are all your

698
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:11,279
pots connected yeah you got a four pot

699
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:12,629
can contend eight hey gallon containers

700
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,819
yeah it's all connected together so

701
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:18,300
connected we can't do any experimenting

702
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:21,210
we can't do side-by-sides um but I think

703
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,710
you will be fine without the RO to tell

704
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,049
you the truth if you've got a small boy

705
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,240
or a big boy that would be ideal but

706
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:32,279
don't mix them I don't think that is the

707
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,200
way to go yeah I wouldn't mix them it so

708
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,269
we voted we say don't make some pick one

709
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,039
pick the other go with that I'm not sure

710
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:39,690
what your approach is yeah if you'd like

711
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:43,230
to send me another message letting me

712
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,730
know what your intent is let me know why

713
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,930
you've thought about using the - maybe

714
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,579
we could go a little further and give

715
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,320
you a little bit better advice and if

716
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:51,059
necessary I can call a friend who's more

717
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,039
of a water expert and then we can see

718
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,599
what they're thinking at that point but

719
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,519
so far with the information I've got

720
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,230
we've taken a vote pick one

721
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,730
stick with it will you do a

722
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,470
phone-a-friend question with the zoo

723
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,759
[ __ ] yeah we sure could all right you

724
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,079
just call them before the show or I

725
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,299
could Google theirs we've got a lot of

726
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,799
options ah but with the information

727
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:12,089
we've got Mike I think we have gone as

728
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:14,250
far as we can go down that path next

729
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:16,049
rabbit hole next rabbit hole I think the

730
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,240
next rabbit hole is to start wrapping up

731
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,769
this episode bro um we've been going for

732
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,059
close to 30 minutes here by the time we

733
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,259
get done doing these outros will be

734
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,149
hitting the 30 minute mark do you have

735
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:28,410
any words of wisdom for the final

736
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:31,500
portion of the podcast just smoke a

737
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:34,110

746
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,330
legs it's just your sad-ass backyard oh

747
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:56,250
I don't want to talk too much about the

748
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:57,269
cone quarantine but I am excited for it

749
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,740
to get over I'd like to get out there

750
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,900
and get some sunshine go see some people

751
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,130
I just want to go sit at the park we

752
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,690
don't even have to do anything if you

753
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,800
just there are three people at the park

754
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,450
and we can see each other like hey

755
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,829
what's up there's people here I haven't

756
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,319
seen you in a while that'd be really

757
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:12,839
cool I know we're not trying to talk

758
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,428
about the corn seen at all but like so

759
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,138
my next-door neighbor didn't I had

760
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:21,149
those drive by and everybody honk

761
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:23,308
birthday things oh and like on the one

762
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:25,768
hand like bummer on the other hand cool

763
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:26,999
but like the kids were like why is

764
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,429
everybody honking we gotta go watch it

765
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,839
so we went out front and the first thing

766
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,860
that struck me cuz there were like six

767
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:37,528
cars in a row that had like the worst

768
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,908
possible age for teenagers like in the

769
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:42,269
car there were two or three of them like

770
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:45,028
12 13 14 15 like the real [ __ ]

771
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,460
[ __ ] years and all of the kids were

772
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:50,999
off their phones like into it waving oh

773
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,548
that is cool and at first it struck me

774
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:54,600
as I oughta just look weird like

775
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:56,700
something's wrong about this picture

776
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,359
fine fine what's missing or whatever you

777
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,819
know what I mean

778
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,829
and then I was like oh man all these

779
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,710
teenagers are really into something this

780
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:06,720
kind of cheesy like [ __ ] we've been

781
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,220
locked down a long time yeah everyone is

782
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,808
so starved for slightly different that

783
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,368
like hey kids you want to go get the car

784

835
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:06,240
bit of time and effort into that one I
