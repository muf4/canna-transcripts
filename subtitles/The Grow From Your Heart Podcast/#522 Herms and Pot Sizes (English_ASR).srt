about what I'm smoking today I've been

labs this is a blend of H a o G and star

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,728
dog on the package the flavor is

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,680
described as earthy fuel and leather

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,810
we've spoken about this concentrate on

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
the show before I mostly agree with

32
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,950
those flavors I love the buzz from the

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,820
cowboy Kush you could tell I'm trying to

34
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,228
catch my breath

35
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,508
the dabs I took kind of took my breath

36
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,920
away it also made me nice and chilled

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,140

00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,689
question on the show some people have

166
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,459
messaged me and they said dude I've

167
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:12,129
emailed you a couple of times why hasn't

168
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:14,620
my email been read you would be amazed

169
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,408
and/or overwhelmed at the amount of

170
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,050
emails I get every single day for the

171
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:21,310
podcast please be patient please bear

172
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,870
with me I know that some of your

173
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,728
questions are very urgent and very

174
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,288
important but I'm trying to get to all

175
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,538
of them in a timely manner and I'm

176
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:30,579
trying to give each message the time and

177
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:32,649
energy and respect which it deserves

178
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,449
you guys rely on me so instead of just

179
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:36,698
breezing through them I try to give a

180
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,770
good answer for each one so it takes me

181
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,230
a minute but I will get to the messages

182
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm going to focus on a lot of emails

183
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,030
the next few shows so let's get right to

184
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,090
it the first email on the pile of emails

185
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:51,609
in today's episode goes just like this

186
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,989
it says what's up Rasta Jeff first off I

187

201
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,479
keep going it says I have some I read

202
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,490
genetics golden goat coming in the mail

203
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,520
any day now and I couldn't be more

204
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,019
excited to run your line one of my

205
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,240
favorite strains and I've never been

206
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,099
able to grow it before I'm excited for

207
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,750
you to get that golden goat I got this

208
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,030
message quite a while ago so you've

209
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,949
probably got those seeds now I hope you

210
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:40,389
are crushing it kick-ass with the golden

211
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:42,879
goat if you've got questions let me know

212
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,250
of course there is a golden goat podcast

213
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,589
episode be sure to enjoy that the

214
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,660
message says anyway my mind is adrift

215
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,219
that sounds like a Phish lyric it says

216
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,770
here we go the question

217
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,290
I grew Holy Grail cush feminised seeds

218
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:58,629
which herm don me in turn which

219
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,540
pollinated our neighbor pineapple chunk

220
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,399
which was also a feminized seed so

221
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,860
they've got a grow room it had Holy

222
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,439
Grail cush feminized seeds they also had

223
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,069
pineapple chunk feminized seeds in this

224
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,110
room

225
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,779
the Holy Grail cush in this room is

226
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,180
suspected of showing intersex traits or

227
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,889
becoming a hermaphrodite and pollinating

228
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,259
the rest of the room so I'm going to

229
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,839
assume you've got a room filled with

230
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,060
seeds now it says question number one

231
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,579
will some of the seeds be feminized I'm

232
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,040
guessing no on this one you are probably

233
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:33,129
correct but I cannot tell you for sure

234
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,190
until you grow them since the pollen

235
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:38,849
donor was a hermaphroditic plant that

236
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,130
trait is going to be at least 50%

237
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,080
existent in your future plants those

238
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:46,360
seeds carry a hermaphroditic trait so

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,370
there's a good chance they will be Herms

240
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,710
there is also a good chance they will be

241
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,450
Femmes but it is more likely you've got

242
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,639
hermaphrodites if you grow them out and

243
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,889
you see any male flowers come out of

244
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,499
them

245
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,048
very likely you've got hermaphroditic

246
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:02,028
seeds the second question is so I've

247
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,649
made an accidental cross I think but

248
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:05,808
will it be worth growing out the seeds

249
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,759
either the seeds from the Holy Grail

250
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:09,438
which was so loaded with seeds I just

251
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,149
made it into edibles or grow out the

252
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:13,248
pineapple chunk seeds crossed to the

253
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,198
Holy Grail I'm not sure this is even

254
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:16,519
considered a cross it's not really a

255
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:18,708
cross it's more like an accidental

256
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,808
pollination it's nothing you would want

257
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:23,328
to give away or share with anybody until

258
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:25,548
you grow out probably a hundred of those

259
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:27,108
seeds each each one you have to grow the

260
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:28,639
Holy Grail Holy Grail

261
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,528
you have to grow the Holy Grail

262
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,389
pineapple chunk seeds you have to grow

263
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,009
all of them and see what you've got

264
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,869
grow them like you would any other

265
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,938
plants but pay very close attention to

266
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:39,739
that veg them take good notes on them

267
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:42,048
flour them take good notes on the

268
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:44,509
flowering cycle pay very close attention

269
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,759
if you see any intersex traits or any

270
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:49,220
problems get rid of them you could have

271
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,259
made gold you could have also made a

272
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,428
bunch of [ __ ] like I said earlier

273
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,558
since one of the parents was a

274
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:56,749
hermaphrodite the future progeny is

275
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:59,298
probably a hermaphrodite you may however

276
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:01,129
find a couple of real gems in there if

277
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:03,048
you don't intend on selling them if you

278
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:05,209
don't intend not profiting from them you

279
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:07,188
have some fun seeds to play with grow a

280
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,568
few see if they're worth a [ __ ] if the

281
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:10,188
first few don't impress you

282
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:12,198
you can abandon the project there's no

283
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:14,389
reason to keep it going but do not

284
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:17,118
spread those shitty seeds to other

285
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:19,970
people the responsibility as a cannabis

286
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:21,199
breeder is to improve the lines that we

287
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,178
were working with not to make it

288
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:24,798
shittier we want to say oh I got these

289
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:26,448
two plants and I'm gonna put them

290
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:28,548
together and the outcome will be better

291
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:29,838
if you make it [ __ ] here you're moving

292
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:31,759
backwards you're time traveling

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,290
backwards you're making the whole race

294
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,699
of cannabis you're making it dumber so

295
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:36,618
we need to make it better we need to

296
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:38,298
move forward that is your goal so if

297
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,709
you've got room time and space grow a

298
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:40,068
few of them out see if they're worth the

299
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,808
[ __ ]

300
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,788
if not throw them away feed them to the

301
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,019
birds put them in the compost bin there

302
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,159
are several options that you could do

303
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,749
with them you can eat them if you're

304
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,918
comfortable with it they're good hemp

305
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,659
seeds or something I don't know get

306
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:52,100
creative there is more to this message

307
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:54,048
though it says I'm going to grow them

308
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,699
out for fun either way yes that is what

309
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,259
you should do I've grown these strains

310
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:58,818
without ever having a problem before but

311
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,038
I was wondering genetically are they

312
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:03,798
just going to herm again or at least

313
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:05,568
very likely that's a good question what

314
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:07,188
happened in that grow room this time it

315
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:08,629
was different did you have a lightly did

316
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:10,279
you overwater did you over

317
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,649
feed to do underwater did you stress

318
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,049
these plants out in multiple ways what

319
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,879
went wrong now that you know you've got

320
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,859
a problem you need to investigate and

321
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,419
diagnose that problem and figure out

322
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,399
what caused that plant or hermaphrodite

323
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,959
was it one in the corner that's near a

324
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,459
light leak was it one by a vent that's

325
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,840
getting a little bit light coming in

326
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
from one of the vents or the ducts or

327
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,129
something you've got to figure out why

328
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,900
that plant armed we know that it's got

329
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,210
that trait we know that it's in the

330
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,679
genetic code we just know that something

331
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,830
unlocked it and we don't know what that

332
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,809
was so as long as it was not unlocked

333
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,639
again by a light leak or something you

334
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,709
can grow that plant but I would only do

335
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,360
it one more time if it harms again if it

336
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,610
[ __ ] up next time get rid of it give it

337
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,220
one more chance see what it does if it

338
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,470
gives you [ __ ] it's got to go a lot of

339
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,360
cush genetics are prone to being

340
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,070
hermaphroditic that is something that is

341
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,259
known in the old school growing

342
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,390
community some cush stuff is a pain in

343
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,159
the ass so it may be just a really

344
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,960
sensitive plant you could have done

345
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,370
something I'm not blaming you but you

346
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,500
could have done something very easily

347
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,600
with the feed with the nutrients with

348
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,950
the spray just being in there you could

349
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,570
have pissed that plant off and just

350
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,580
triggered that plant to show it's

351
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,020
intersex traits there is more to this

352
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,310
message I want to keep going it says

353
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,559
I've been growing it consistently for

354
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,329
three years I have everything dialed in

355
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,329
which includes these strains so I think

356
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,759
the herm was just a fluke something

357
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,490
caused it the fluke hurm out of three

358
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,559
years is not a thing that something

359
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,990
caused that it's not just happening

360
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,479
there is a cause that is a reaction to a

361
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,129
cause it says thank you again for all

362
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,379
that you do I hope to see you around our

363
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:46,399
beautiful state I will for sure say

364
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,779
hello if I do with love from red Heights

365

366
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,350
Colorado person I hope we get to bump

367
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,509
into each other as soon as this

368
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,759
quarantine situation is done we can

369
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,559
smoke a joint more than did Philly at

370
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,269
that time they big shout-out to my

371

great message I hope you figure out what

373
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,669
is causing that Holy Grail cush to go

374
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,429
home on you because that is a great

375
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,409

right here in front of me this one comes

387
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,079
from I don't think they want their name

388
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,700
it says deep in prohibition land so

389
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,920
let's not even say their name they will

390
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,310
know who they are the message goes just

391
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,589
like this yo Jeff I hope you were doing

392
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,489
well sir I am great so far thank you for

393
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,350
checking in on me

394
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,120
I have not contributed to the podcast

395
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,009
yet but I plan on it hey that's all

396
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,200
right man I don't expect everybody to

397
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,939
contribute to patreon I know I mentioned

398
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,009
and talk about the patreon quite often

399
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,810
at least once maybe twice every episode

400
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,220
but I still love you I still want you to

401
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,289

403
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,370
show is free it's free for everybody

404
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,110
some people are able to help they will

405
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,360
help out for everybody if you cannot

406
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,550
keep listening all you have to do is be

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,560
the best grower that you can be that's

408
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,029
all I ask of you think about that every

409
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,409
time you walk into the grow room think

410
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,850
about that whenever you walk out of the

411
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:17,409
grow room think about that when you're

412
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,420
sharing grow knowledge and grow advice

413
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,459
be the best grower you can be and never

414
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,679
give bad advice never give untested

415
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,660
unsound advice never do stupid [ __ ] in

416
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,039
your garden never be lazy always have a

417
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:29,559
good attitude when you're in the grow

418
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,750
never go in your garden thinking about

419
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,250
this is going to yield two pounds and

420
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm going to make this much money

421
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,850
[ __ ] that never think about your wallet

422
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,290
when you're in the grow room if you're

423
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,550
having a hard time with somebody maybe

424
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,110
if you're fighting with somebody at work

425
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,039
maybe your boss yelled at you maybe

426
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,450
you're having a hard time with your

427
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,159
girlfriend maybe you had to discipline

428
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,750
your kids and you got some weird weight

429
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,339
on your shoulders or a weird feeling in

430
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,019
your heart don't take that into the grow

431
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,460
room with you leave that right outside

432
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,169
the grow room door go in the grow room

433
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,300
and let that be your place of bliss

434
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:57,459
share that with the plants that is a

435
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,839
really important thing to think about do

436
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,550
that for me and you don't have to

437
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,290
contribute to the podcast that is free

438
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,879
keep a good positive attitude in the

439
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:05,709
grow room keep a good positive attitude

440
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,059
[ __ ] everywhere but let it start

441
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,950
right there in the grow let it grow

442
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,539
right along with your plants then walk

443
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,550
out of there carry that cool vibe with

444
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:15,099
you all day be like that it's much

445
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,419
easier anyway it's all free also have a

446
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,490
good attitude it doesn't [ __ ] cost

447
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:19,990
anything and it's very rewarding let's

448
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,269
stay focused because I'm getting rambley

449
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,610
it says I did however order three packs

450
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,710
of I read genetic seeds recently which

451
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,019
includes orange gasm Raphael and

452
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,030
Michelangelo you've got a great mix that

453
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,769
is going to be very flavorful it says

454
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,689
I'm growing in a three by three tent

455
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:35,649
sounds good so far with the timber grow

456
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,829
light not familiar

457
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,379
but I can read about it with for 0:29 s

458
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:43,628
and my first grow tent well with two

459
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,759
regular plants alright so he's got a

460
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,800
three by three tent a couple of fancy

461
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,539
lights are four of one kind of light in

462
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,169
one fancy light in there it's the first

463
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:55,088
tent with two regular plants he says I

464
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,469
will be using radical bags which is cool

465
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,749
I know a lot of folks that support the

466
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,939
radical bags and the five-gallon side

467
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:03,399
with ocean forest and nectar of the Gods

468
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:04,899
nutrients and supplements I use bamboo

469
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,178
sticks in my first grow which worked

470
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,308
well and I may try a scrub moving

471
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:12,159
forward if you plan on moving the plants

472
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:14,198
around use the sticks if you can live

473
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,299
with having the plants stuck in place if

474
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,308
you can get around that 3x3 tint to

475
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:21,338
water very well if you can reach every

476
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:23,259
pot I recommend a scrog the scrog will

477
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,809
be much easier much more uniform and

478
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:27,009
much safer and in the three by three all

479
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,629
you have to do is strap it up to the

480
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:30,938
corners and the tent and when it comes

481
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,399
to be watering feeding defoliating

482
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:35,078
working time you can almost unwrap all

483
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,058
of the tent around it most of the good

484
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,919
tents are made where they really unzip

485
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:41,678
really far and you've got access to most

486
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,448
probably three of the four sides of that

487
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:45,549
grow probably one sides up against the

488
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:47,229
wall anyway so you can usually access

489
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,969
three full sides in the tents if you do

490
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,129
it right I would recommend the trellis

491
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,509
those sticks are great but they get

492
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:55,149
dangerous you'll poke yourself in the

493
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:56,889
eye with them also make it dirty break

494
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,448
one of those bamboo sticks open one time

495
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,620
and see how much mold and see how much

496
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:01,389
[ __ ] is inside of there

497
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,308
you'll be grossed out it's kind of gross

498
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,318
if you're gonna use sticks I recommend

499
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:09,308
you throw them away after every grow or

500
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:10,269
use the plastic coated metal type garden

501
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:12,578
sticks they're a little more expensive

502
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:14,619
but they are safer you can clean them

503
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,658
they're more reliable they last longer

504
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,828
it's an investment up front but you

505
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,539
don't have to throw them away and they

506
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,398
don't cause problems in the end all

507
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,619
right I should keep myself on track here

508
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:25,088
where are we I am at this part using

509
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,068
bamboo sticks in my first girl I have a

510
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,470
question about the number of plants I

511
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:31,119
should try to grow in a 3x3 as I know

512
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,710
your plants will grow with hyper vigor

513
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,389
and I'm curious if I should start

514
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,788
growing one plant and give her some room

515
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,190
or go for two and have them bump elbows

516
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:41,408
so to speak the only issues I had with

517
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,450
my first girl was heat but I did go with

518
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:45,789
the gorilla grow tent this time and I

519
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,980
have a 9 foot ceiling so I think things

520
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:49,460
will be slightly cooler and I do have a

521
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,740
carbon filter with a

522
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,000
six inch infinity fan all right you've

523
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,919
got a lot of cool things to think about

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,659
keep in mind that even if you've got a

525
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,220
carbon filter in the fan wherever you're

526
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,960
dumping that heat if it's going right

527
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,909
into the same bedroom it will end up

528
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,220
back into the tent I've done a recent

529
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:06,140
episode on grow tent setup I recommend

530
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,089
you check that one out also hopefully

531
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,309
you've already heard it now the main

532
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:12,740
question here is how many five-gallon

533
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:15,109
pots should I run in a three by three

534
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,028
tent you have got a couple of options

535
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:19,308
and a couple of things to think about if

536
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:22,308
you were going to scrog it I recommend

537
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:25,278
somewhere between two and maybe four

538
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:28,129
five gallon pots in that small space and

539
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:29,750
I would use a scrog net really close to

540
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,669
the plants to spread them out really

541
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,558
wide don't let them grow straight up get

542
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,480
them really wide once they're nice and

543
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,369
spread out I would put another net above

544
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,860
them and let them grow into that net

545
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:42,500
then I would work that net to fill the

546
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:45,019
entire canopy once the entire canopy was

547
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,089
filled with a nice nice bushy hedge of

548
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:49,308
branches and tops that's when I would

549
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:51,139
put a third net above that and flip into

550
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:53,599
flower and let them grow into that third

551
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,190
net so you would have three layers of

552
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,928
net you would have a spreader then you

553
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,298
would have a scrog stretcher then you

554
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:02,298
would have the support net I would do

555
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:04,788
somewhere between two and four five

556
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:07,158
gallon pots now let's go deeper into

557
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:09,710
some of those options if you do one it

558
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,080
is going to take quite some time to veg

559
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,759
that one plant out long enough to fill

560
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,308
that space it's going to take quite a

561
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,679
while if you do too you start filling

562
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:20,148
the space more quickly you don't have to

563
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,940
wait as long you're gonna fill the space

564
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:24,859
twice as fast if you do three obviously

565
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,470
you're reducing veg time if you do four

566
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:29,509
obviously you've cut down veg to mend

567
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,579
ously we can fill this space much more

568
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,200
quickly with more plants now there are

569
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,879
things to consider when it comes to

570
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,590
these plant numbers how many plants are

571
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
you allowed to have if you can only have

572
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:41,298
two stay legal grow two

573
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,339
wink-wink now when we start watering

574
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:46,129
these five gallon pots we are

575
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:48,678
introducing a lot of water into a three

576
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,380
by three room you're running five gallon

577
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,620
radical bags how many gallons of water

578
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,110
does it take to fully saturate a five

579
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:59,839
gallon radical bag I'm going to guess

580
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:02,148
you can pour a solid gallon maybe two

581
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,779
gallons of water into that radical bag

582
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:05,449
and

583
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:07,879
every two to three days now if you've

584
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,650
got four of those in that room that is

585
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,140
going to be approximately eight gallons

586
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,780
of water poured into your radical bags

587
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,180
and a three by three grow tent every two

588
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:19,940
to three days that is going to create a

589
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,320
tremendous amount of humidity first

590
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,000
you've got the water you've already

591
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,619
poured into the pots the light in the

592
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,750
room is going to heat up the room that

593
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,819
is going to create evaporation from the

594
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,140
water that is already in the pots then

595
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:32,359
the plants are going to be letting out

596
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,710
water already on their own that is going

597
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:35,569
to create more humidity in the

598
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,160
environment you are going to have to

599
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,259
vent that room and pay very close

600
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,240
attention to your VPD you will have to

601
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,339
defoliate heavily to slow down that

602
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,559
release of water and also to prevent any

603
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,849
kind of bud rot or powdery mildew you're

604
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,159
going to have a lot of moisture in the

605
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:51,379
air and that causes a lot of problems so

606
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,360
if you can get the air out of that room

607
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,280
I would do four pots if you can't

608
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,679
control the air and the moisture maybe

609
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,139
reduce it to three if you can be patient

610
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,000
and let it veg really slowly go for two

611
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,200
if you're really worried about moisture

612
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,180
which you shouldn't be I'm making you

613
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,009
paranoid one or two plants will be fine

614
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,720
three will be kind of pushing it for

615
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,519
you're gonna have to pay attention if

616
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,500
you can get that air out of the bedroom

617
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,480
or whatever room you've got your tent in

618
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,309
you'll be okay but keep in mind if

619
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,620
you're just ducting the air out of the

620
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,089
tent into a spare bedroom it is going to

621
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,219
go right back into the grow tent you've

622
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,049
got to adjust that climate somehow with

623
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,299
equipment or cycle it through another

624
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,799
room let that air blend with room from

625
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,450
another bedroom from the main part of

626
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,250
the house from the central air you've

627
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,470
got to get that humidity that old

628
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,690
stagnant air balanced out also we need

629
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,910
air exchange to get fresh co2 to the

630
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,470
environment but again I would recommend

631
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,360
one plant if you want to be really

632
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,370
patient to plants if you want to fill

633
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,199
that scrog up three plants if you want

634
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,449
to go at it and four plants if you

635
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,529
really want to [ __ ] kill it maybe if

636
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,180
you can fit them in there and you

637
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,730
haven't already bought the pots maybe

638
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,380
consider two seven gallon pots but again

639
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,299
we're going to have a lot of water and a

640
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,980
lot of moisture in there part of my

641
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,289
thought process almost recommended

642
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,289
reducing the pot size so that we can get

643
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,879
a faster wet and dry time but I still

644
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,619
think we're going to be pouring a lot of

645
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,390
water into that room just more

646
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,159
frequently but it is something you can

647
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,840
consider if you have smaller pots that

648
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,940
is less water but you're going to have

649
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,428
to water every day or every other day

650
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,740
there are pros and cons to the bigger

651
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,600
pots in the smaller pots you guys know

652
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,829
that I like to water every other day

653
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,618
because I like a custom-tailored

654
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:26,298
nutrient mix I also like to add boosts

655
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:28,459
and do different things every other day

656
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:30,408
that gives me a lot of control bigger

657
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,360
pots you only get to water them once or

658
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:34,700
twice a week so you can only adjust your

659
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,469
feed that often if you see a problem you

660
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,610
want to make a change you've got to wait

661
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,048
if you watered Monday

662
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,028
you've probably got to wait until

663
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:42,168
Thursday to make a change and if that

664
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,298
change doesn't work you're probably

665
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,700
waiting until Monday for your next water

666
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:48,950
when I'm running smaller pots of cocoa I

667
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,509
get to water every other day if I say oh

668
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,069
I should increase nitrogen that means

669
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,450
tomorrow I get to increase the nitrogen

670
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,638
I don't have to wait until Thursday

671
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,319
that's just something I like something

672
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:59,479
to think about something to consider

673
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,509
don't let me derail your entire project

674
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,849
with crazy ideas and crazy grower talk I

675
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,278
like your plan your strategy is going to

676
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:10,038
work so I would probably do two or three

677
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,839
five gallon pots or two seven gallon

678
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,638
pots if they would fit in the room if

679
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,959
you want a lot of work and you want to

680
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:17,990
kind of struggle and make it a challenge

681
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,860
do four five gallon pots it'll keep you

682
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,720
on your toes

683
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:22,038
alright there is more to this message it

684
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,470
says I just wanted to pick your brain

685
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,388
also the nectar of the gods line does

686
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,490
have a six bottle sample pack they send

687
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:31,308
out for free Bhuvan e offered me a pack

688
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,138
um I don't have room to test a sample

689
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:34,278
pack right now but maybe in the future I

690
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,589
do appreciate that

691
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,388
I am stocked up on veg bloom and new mil

692
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:40,970
and I've got a nice system and I'm

693
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:42,079
afraid to change it honestly but it says

694
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,240
I've listened to it probably a hundred

695

on us it does not feel like it because

736
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,888
of this social distancing because of

737
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:10,229
