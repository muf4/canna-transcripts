to a few other people in the previous

00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,119
episode i read a message from a disabled

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,039
veteran

102
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
who was asking about advice for a grow

103
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,560
light i didn't think that their budget

104
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
was going to get them a quality light so

105
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
i asked my audience for a little bit of

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,519
guidance and possibly some help

107
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,158
and the response was overwhelming thank

108
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
you

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,840
this listener that asked for help is

110
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
going to get a grow light and a few more

111
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
of my listeners are going to get grow

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,719
lights

113
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,759
because we had some very generous people

114
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,598
reach out to me

115
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,120
uh by the time this episode comes out i

116
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,679
will be in the works of putting people

117
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
in touch

118
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
to get grow lights shipped to the

119
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
appropriate people so we can get some

120
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
disabled veterans and some people in

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
need growing quality medicine

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799

123
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,158
and contributed wanted a shout out

124

125

170
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,478
we were in the same club

171
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,240
we were both big followers and

172
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,478
supporters of subcool

173
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
we are both in the irie army i may be

174
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,240
the leader i think i may have

175
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
designated lemur priest as the leader of

176
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,038
the irie army the captain and commander

177
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,000

179
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
when subcool passed i did feel uh sort

180
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,000
of a

181
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
an absence a gap in the cannabis

182
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
community i'm gonna keep reading the

183
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,959

184
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,840

00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,519

194
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,240
for me

195
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,758
to read it's more private to myself the

196
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
part i wanted to touch on

197
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,038
is the sub cool part thank you first of

198
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
all for the compliments i'm glad you

199
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,439
found me

200
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,799
um when subcool passed i did feel a void

201
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,680
there was an opening there was something

202
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
that had to be done

203
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,959
subcool love him or hate him subcool was

204
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
a great teacher he was a speaker he was

205
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,079
outspoken

206
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
he liked to interact with his people his

207
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,918
followers whatever you call them

208
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
uh the tga team green avengers he

209
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,519
interacted the weed nerds he interacted

210
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,279
with the weed nerds quite a bit

211
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,560
i enjoyed that i learned a lot from him

212
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,478
without sub cool

213
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,079
i wouldn't be where i am today so if you

214
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,399
love sub if you hate sub

215
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,240
i am partly his fault he's partly my

216
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,758
fault no i think i'm his fault

217
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
he created this monster he's part of

218
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
what created this monster so

219
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,478
without subby i wouldn't be here i

220
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,918
wouldn't have a seed company i wouldn't

221
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,519
have a podcast things would be much

222
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,079
different for both of us without sub

223
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,680
cool

224
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,519
so big shout out to subcool i think um

225
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,720
what i'm getting at is when subcool

226
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,478
passed i knew

227
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
there was a void i knew there was a gap

228
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,800
that needed to be filled and i think

229
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,520
i slowly accidentally took it upon

230
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
myself

231
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,120
to kind of fill that sub cool gap

232
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
somebody's got to be teaching people

233
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
somebody's got to be reading emails and

234
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,879
giving solutions and helping [ __ ] out i

235
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,479
thought that would be me so i've stepped

236
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,360
up my game a little bit since sub cool

237
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,079
is gone

238
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
um i do more shows i try to do more live

239
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,879
shows i go on more things i answer more

240
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,038
emails

241
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,879
i try i've tried to step up and fill the

242
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,360
space that subcool left i feel like in a

243
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,879
way

244
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
the torch has been passed i was the

245
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,639
generation after sub cool

246
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,879
subcool didn't physically reach down and

247
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,280
go rasta jeff it's your turn but

248
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,959
in many ways that torch was passed to me

249
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,758
i know that it's my responsibility to

250
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,879
carry on

251
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,199
that sub cool thing that he was doing

252
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,120
in several ways i'm doing it uh here on

253
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
social media here on youtube here on

254
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
apple podcast through

255
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
podcasting through social media i'm

256
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,079
getting the sub cool

257
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,519
vibe and things carrying on through me

258
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,038
i'm doing my own thing but a lot of it

259
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,279
is for and from sub

260
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,199
another thing i'm doing have done is i

261
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,918
crossed a bunch of my stuff

262
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,520
to a sub cool jack the ripper male i've

263
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,719
got a jack the ripper male that is just

264
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,639
a [ __ ] stud

265
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
i've pollinated several of my irie

266
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,038
genetics elite cuts with that plant

267
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
so i've crossed the ire genetics with

268
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,240
the sub cool seeds

269
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,639
that's one thing i can do to kind of

270
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,560
honor subcool i made jack the ripper f2s

271
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
that'll keep sub cool's memory and honor

272
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,079
alive he'll be growing in people's

273
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
gardens long after we're both gone so

274
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,318
that's going to be something i could do

275
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
for sub

276
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800

my respects with a little cash you've

322
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,359
definitely saved me more

323
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,360
than 10 a month i love hearing that

324
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
i put out these episodes for free it's

325
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
supposed to be free to reach everybody

326
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,399
if somebody saves a couple of bucks in

327
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,479
their garden if you make a couple of

328
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
extra bucks on my advice feel free to

329
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,680
hit me up on patreon like our friend did

330
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
here i don't expect it

331
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,199
it is not required but these types of

332
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
things like a little tip like a little

333
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,879

growing thc rich plants

393
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
it's a really good question in my

394
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
experience

395
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,638
i did not notice much difference if any

396
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
difference at all

397
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,320
when growing cbd dominant rich plants

398
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,078
i was working in a large commercial grow

399
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
we had nearly a thousand plants in the

400
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,719
flowering room

401
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
most of those plants we were aiming for

402
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,759
that high thc stuff a lot of golden goat

403
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
uh we had lemon jeffrey uh what was also

404
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
well what else was in there the

405
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,799
uh the pineapple the cactus cooler was

406
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
in there uh just a bunch of stuff like

407
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,439
that that would really hit the pineapple

408
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,799
something was in there

409
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
a bunch of sativa stuff that would

410
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,120
really pay the lemon g was in there all

411
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,958
day

412
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,879
stuff that would pay the bills sativa

413
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,719
dominant stuff that hit real hard

414
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,078
also we knew that we needed medicine in

415
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
there for the cbd

416
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,519
desired people so we had some cbd

417
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,159
crosses in there

418
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
if i remember correctly in that grow we

419
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,838
had

420
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,399
harlequin in there also we had ac dc in

421
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,040
there

422
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,320
we also had a plant called toro bora in

423
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,159
there i'll talk a little bit about each

424
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,399
of these plants now

425
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,958
harlequin was a uh cbd rich plant that

426
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,879
grew

427
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,000
like a sativa it grew tall it grew

428
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,679
skinny it had

429
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,278
kind of longer slender leaves it didn't

430
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,958
have the big fat white leaves you would

431
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,439
expect an indica plant to have

432
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,319
it had more of a skinny sativa structure

433
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
that plant was

434
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,160
very very cbd rich

435
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
that one grew exactly like all of the

436
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,159
other thc plants in the garden

437
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,159
it got tall it got branchy it looked

438
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,319
just like them it smelled just like them

439
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,759
but when we cut it down and tested it it

440
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
was mostly i don't remember the numbers

441
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,399
off the top of my head but i know that

442
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,278
that one was around

443
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,078
for the cbd and it was very cbd rich i

444
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,480
wasn't doing

445
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,399
anything in the grow special to bring

446
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,399
out the cbd it was just happening from

447
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,679
that plant it was that plant's tree

448
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,240
so the harlequin grew tall and skinny i

449
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,319
looked a lot like the other thc dominant

450
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,360
sativa style plants in the room

451
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
the other one we're growing is ac dc the

452
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
ac dc

453
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,439
was similar to the harlequin it was a

454
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,278
tall plant it was branchy

455
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
it had those skinnier leaves it branched

456
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,480
out quite a bit uh

457
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,479
had like more of a sativa look i just

458
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
keep saying sativa it had that branchier

459
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,000
sativa look not the

460
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,000
short squatty indica thing that we think

461
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,879
of sometimes when we may think of cbd

462
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,159
plants

463
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,399
so these two looked like our normal

464
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,399
thc plants they grew just like them they

465
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,078
got the longer skinnier leaves

466
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
it didn't do anything different it

467
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,838
didn't smell look taste or grow

468
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,198
any differently than the rest of the

469
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,240
grow those

470
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,919
were rich rich in cbd we didn't do

471
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,198
anything i didn't do anything to either

472
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,479
one of those plants to make them

473
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,958
different

474
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,839
there was however a plant that i did

475
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:35,039
grow that was known to be rich in cbd

476
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,519
that was a um honestly it was a picky

477
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,278
finicky little [ __ ] that plant didn't

478
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,879
like anybody or anything

479
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,799
everybody i gave that plant to was like

480
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,120
yeah i got rid of it [ __ ] that plant

481
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,958
uh that plant was called tora bora that

482
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
plant was a gift from a friend

483
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,479
they won cbd awards with this plant this

484
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
plant produced

485
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,759
really great cbd numbers it was like a

486
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
2.5

487
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,240
to 1 cbd to thc that meant for every

488
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,519
thc nanogram or milliliter uh in the

489
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,198
percentage that was there

490
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,440
there were 2.5 percent uh 2.5 times that

491
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,639
of cbd so if there's one thc there was

492
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
2.5

493
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
whatever your measurement in increments

494
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
was of cbd that was kind of unheard of

495
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,159
and amazing at that time

496
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,679
that plant went around the medical

497
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,919
marijuana community here in southern

498
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,439
colorado for quite a while i got it

499
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,879
i'm not sure i was supposed to spread it

500
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
out but since it's medicine like that i

501
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,000
[ __ ] spread it out i gave that cut to

502
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
a lot of people

503
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,759
also i bred to it none of the breeding

504
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600
projects that came out of that were

505
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,879
worth the [ __ ] either all the offspring

506
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
were a little bit funky they were

507
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,480
finicky they were picky i was not the

508
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,159
best breeding ever

509
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,680
so let's talk briefly about the tora

510
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,639
bora it looked

511
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,638
like a purple squatty indica plant no

512
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
matter what you did to it it would look

513
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,480
angry and frustrated the leaves would

514
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
curl up at the tips it would turn purple

515
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
and dark by the end of flower

516
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
it was an og kush dominant plant i can't

517
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
remember the cross off the top of my

518
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,638
head it was og-18 and something else

519
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,039
uh maybe la confidential but they called

520
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,198
it tora bora it was from dna genetics

521
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,958
i'm not bashing their strain i'm bashing

522
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,919
the cut that we had

523
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,719
they put out amazing medicine but it was

524
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,278
a [ __ ]

525
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,079
to grow it was the worst to grow in the

526
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,399
garden

527
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,159
uh it was squatty it was short it was

528
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
stout it didn't like water it didn't

529
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,639
like being dry it didn't like warm

530
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
it like being cold and [ __ ] just

531
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,919
leave it alone and let it grow

532
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,278
if you topped it it would slow down if

533
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,399
you popped and twisted it would get

534
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,000
angry on you

535
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,958
that plant sucked to grow so

536
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
the things i can say is in my experience

537
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,638
there wasn't anything we but that plant

538
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
the torabora plant that sucked put out

539
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
high numbers no matter what we did so it

540
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
was i think it's plant-specific if you

541
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,039
grow the plant like you're growing the

542
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
thc plants

543
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,599
it should put out the high cbd if that

544
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
is what the plant does

545
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
i haven't tried to bring out the cbd

546
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,759
honestly i grow when you're running a

547
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,198
300

548
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,800
[ __ ] light area and you've got

549
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,319
thousands of plants in there they all

550
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,000
get fed the same thing they all get

551
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
treated basically the same way

552
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,278
there may be rows that could treat it a

553
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
certain way but i don't we didn't do

554
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,038
anything special to bring out the cbd

555
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,119
and the cbd rich plants

556
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
i can talk about things that i know they

557
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,159
do on commercial

558
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,759
cbd farms hemp farms that do bring out

559
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
the cbd but also

560
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,400
this is done in colorado this is my

561
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,600
setup to this in colorado

562
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
we have to test our cbd our hemp crops

563
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,879
have to be tested for thc

564
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,558
and cbd if there is the higher amount of

565
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
thc than allowed in there

566
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,319
that crop cannot be sold as hemp that is

567
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,759
now a cannabis crop

568
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,279
and if you're a hemp grower that's now

569
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,640
illegal it's got to be thrown away it's

570
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,599
trash

571
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,440
so one thing that the hemp growers do to

572
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,000
prevent their test from getting too high

573
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,360
in

574
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,480
thc oftentimes they will cut the plants

575
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,159
down early

576
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,679
you don't have i don't i'm not going to

577
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
assume you've got the ability

578
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,000
to test your plants on like a daily

579
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,720
basis but in some cases

580
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
these guys on the farms with big cbd

581
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,839
farms

582
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
will cut a bud off of the branch off the

583
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,558
plant every

584
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,159
three every five days every week at a

585
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,319
starting around week six they'll start

586
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,759
cut maybe week five start taking buds

587
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,798
off and mailing it into the lab or

588
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,079
getting it to the lab

589
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,319
so they can test it the minute we see

590
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,599
the thc starting to rise higher than

591
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,599
it's acceptable if

592
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,119
we start seeing thc in there we got to

593
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,399
cut down the plants because now they're

594
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,000
going to start the cannabinoids are

595
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,919
going to start converting the cbg will

596
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,839
now become thc

597
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,000
that is their way around a lot of

598
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,119
failing lab tests just cut it early

599
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,240
before it can become a thc before it can

600
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,399
convert

601
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
also that may be a thing you can do if

602
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
you want higher cbd and less thc you may

603
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
cut it down

604
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,000
earlier i'm not saying that's a way to

605
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
do it but that is something i've seen

606
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
done in colorado

607
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
if you want to get it before it gets to

608
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
thc you can do that if you're making

609
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
topicals or something and it's not

610
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,960
smokable

611
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
that may be a viable option for you

612
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,880
another thing i do think helps is

613
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
colder temperatures seems to bring out

614
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,679
that cbd i can't

615
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,918
promise that that is something i've

616
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,759
heard the cbd growers mention

617
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,000
so grow it just like normal dial it in

618
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,679
i always say grow that cultivar grow

619
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
that plant a few times if you've got

620
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,840
something that you know

621
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,520
presents cbd grow it the best you can

622
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,319
and see how much cbd you were getting

623
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,839
out of it

624
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,359
uh one thing i can recommend is cut it

625
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,119
down at different intervals maybe cut

626
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,918
one in week seven one at week eight one

627
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,599
a week nine

628
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,360
maybe cut a branch a week seven eight

629
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,439
nine and see which one is better for you

630
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,279
but to the best of my memory the best of

631
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,840
my knowledge the best of my ability

632
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,279
we just grow the cbd rich plants exactly

633
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,558
like we do the thc

634
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,879
and we just let them produce the

635
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,519
cannabinoids they naturally create for

636
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
us

637
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,720
uh dial in the room dial in the plants

638
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,240
build a relationship with it

639
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,759
and hopefully you can get those numbers

640
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,519
up right where you need them uh good

641
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,798
luck to mom i hope she is cancer-free i

642
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,918

666
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
controversial question

667
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,400
it says the guys on the dude groad show

668
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,158
dude groves

669
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,038
show have talked about whether it's

670
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,880
beneficial or not is this something new

671
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,400
flushing has been a hot topic for quite

672
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
a while i've talked about it a couple of

673
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
times it always comes up in the cannabis

674
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,119
community it's a great question

675
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
it says have you tried this before is

676
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,558
there new information about flushing

677
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,038
thanks again for your help and have a

678
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,319
great day you can say my name it is ryan

679
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,679
what's up ryan thank you for the great

680
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,759
message

681
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
so let's get into this we're going to

682
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,038
stir up controversy on this episode i

683
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,400
look forward to your feedback my email

684
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,359
address is grow fromyourheart at

685
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,400
hotmail.com make sure you put the word

686
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,000
flushing

687
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
in the subject line when you respond

688
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
about this flushing

689
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,879
there are a lot of ways to look at

690
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,200
flushing a lot of ideas behind flushing

691
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,480
a lot of purposes to flushing

692
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,840
um and i see two different or three or

693
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
maybe four different approaches to

694
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,720
flushing

695
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,839
if you're growing in a super soil if you

696
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,038
have taken

697
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,158
a natural organic product a bunch of

698
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,079
i don't even know what's going to go in

699
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,080
our super soil alfalfa meal

700
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,599
uh we would hear bone meal fish meal

701
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,879
blood meal i wouldn't put that stuff but

702
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,038
that type of stuff goes in

703
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
if you've got an organic living soil if

704
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,879
you're building a soil

705
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,359
and it is cooking and you're not using

706
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
uh

707
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:47,439
chelated bottled buffered nutrients

708
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,400
there may not be a need for flushing

709
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,480
because

710
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,080
your plant is not going to uptake things

711
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,519
that it doesn't need we're not force

712
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,319
feeding the plant when you make

713
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,798
an organic soil that is just naturally

714
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,439
bio

715
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,000
available to the plant the roots go down

716
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
and this is

717
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
just the very simple version of this

718
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,599
don't get on me too critically

719
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,599
the roots start growing and they're

720
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,519
growing and they say the plant goes

721
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,798
hey roots we need some nitrogen and the

722
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,079
plants go oh there's nitrogen over here

723
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,119
and it just grows down and gets it and

724
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,399
eats up nitrogen

725
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,479
and then exudates in the plant

726
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
communicate with enzymes uh that

727
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
communicate with the rhizosphere that

728
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,319
says hey bro

729
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
we got enough nitrogen you think you

730
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,639
could send up some malibu number the

731
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
roots go

732
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
believed in them we got you bro turn off

733
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,120
the nitrogen suckers start shooting the

734
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,038
lead in them around

735
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,479
now it's like basically you had enough

736
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,200
of your main course whatever your main

737
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
course was

738
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
maybe now could you send me some mashed

739
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
potatoes down sure bro we got mashed

740
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,319
potatoes for you

741
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
so now you're just getting different

742
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,879
things the plant signals that it needs

743
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,640
different things

744
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,159
through exudates to the root zone the

745
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,440
root zone goes oh you need this we'll go

746
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
find it and it goes and finds those

747
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,519
things

748
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,279
the plant basically eats what it needs

749
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,038
when it needs it it's there

750
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,639
bioavailable in your plant in the

751
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,200
rhizosphere in the root zone because

752
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,759
you've

753
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,720
whipped up and cooked an organic soil or

754
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,798
a living soil

755
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,240
that has got all of your necessities in

756
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,400
that soil right

757
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,839
so the plant it's not going to overfeed

758
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
itself it's not going to stuff itself

759
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,558
it's not a fat glutton it's not going to

760
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,558
get a big old

761
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,240
pork pot a big old pot belly geez that

762
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,678
was hard to say it's not going to get a

763
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,558
big old pot belly and just sit around

764
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,240
and become lazy

765
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,839
because it's got to work for its food

766
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,759
it's got triggers that tell it i'm full

767
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,000
i should stop eating

768
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,158
the difference when we're feeding

769
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
bottled chelated nutrients

770
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
is that there are things in those

771
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,519
nutrients that tell the plant [ __ ]

772
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,119
eat this

773
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,279
and you're basically just injecting the

774
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,038
plant with more nutrients all day long

775
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,798
the signals to tell it to stop don't

776
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,480
work because it's not eating the right

777
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,000
the same kind of food i just said right

778
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
food maybe that organic way is the way

779
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,919
to go

780
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,520
it's not eating the things that would

781
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
tell that plant yeah i've had enough

782
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,918
nitrogen

783
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
let's work on that molybdenum there are

784
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
things in those shalated buffer

785
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,480
nutrients that go oh

786
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
nitrogen take more ooh nitrogen take

787
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,319
more and it's almost like drugs for your

788
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,679
plants the plants will easily easily

789
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,599
overdo it

790
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,278
so with those two things in mind with

791
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,959
the salts and the bottled chelated

792
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,679
nutrients let's talk about why to flush

793
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,200
one and why one may not be necessary

794
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,720
i'm sure you could see it with the

795
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,278
bottled chelated nutrients we've got a

796
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,519
soil

797
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,319
that is filled with salt bottled

798
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,038
nutrients

799
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,399
chelations uh weird ionic exchanges that

800
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,720
i'm not even sure what's happening in

801
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,038
there

802
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,079
that plants being force-fed [ __ ] all day

803
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,000
long

804
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,839
so that plant may need to be flushed

805
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
because it's got a lot of excess stuff

806
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,959
running through that plant through its

807
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
vascular system it's got things moving

808
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
around mobile elements

809
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360
that we may not that may not be we're

810
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
going to talk about this part in a

811
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,558
moment that may not be

812
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,158
desirable when it comes to smoking time

813
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,558
it may not make our plants burn and

814
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,039
taste

815
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,678
the best that it could so in my opinion

816
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,640
it is

817
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,320
absolutely desirable and best to flush

818
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
if you're using bottled nutrients

819
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,480
absolutely flush for 7 10 maybe 14 days

820
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,159
depending on

821
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,159
how much you fed what you fed and what

822
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
your uh what's in your pot or using

823
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,480
cocoa

824
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
are using soilless mix if you're in

825
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,000
hydro you can definitely go like 10 days

826
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,319
and you should be clean if you didn't

827
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,558
over

828
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,639
feed if you're using a soilless mix you

829
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,079
might want to flush for like 14 days

830
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
clean out that rhizosphere clean

831
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,918
everything out get the plants to quit

832
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,558
eating

833
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,159
let them cannibalize themselves now if

834
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,839
you're using organics and you didn't put

835
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
anything that was buffered chelated in

836
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,839
there

837
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,678
it may not be necessary to flush i

838
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,879
cannot tell you you don't need to flush

839
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
because i don't want to [ __ ] up your

840
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
grow

841
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,798
but the plants aren't eating anything

842
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,558
unnecessary

843
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,158
if the plants are done and they know it

844
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,759
is time if they're in senescence they

845
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
have stopped eating anyway

846
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,240
they're just going to quit eating

847
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,519
they're going to cannibalize themselves

848
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,960
and they're going to fade off like it is

849
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,558
fall they're only supposed to be around

850
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
for a year they don't expect to live any

851
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,480
longer

852
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,240
so you may not need to flush also our

853
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,480
friend sub cool shot at the sub cool

854
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,839
he used to whip up super soil mixes and

855
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,798
he would say i've been flushing the

856
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,199
whole time

857
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,798
he would make a batch of soil that in

858
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,038
his experience would be

859
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,119
strong enough lively enough potent

860
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,200
enough nutrient rich enough

861
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,798
to last the duration of the grow he

862
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
would start in a veg pot

863
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,240
then right before a flower he would up

864
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
that pot into a larger pot with fresh

865
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,798
soil in it

866
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,719
those roots would grow into that and eat

867
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,240
all the nutrients in that soil and feed

868
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,159
the plant through its whole life

869
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,519
all he has to do is feed it water all

870
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,880
i've been doing is flushing the whole

871
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,278
time is what he would say

872
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,120
so in that situation like we're saying

873
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,960
he's been flushing the entire time and

874
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,119
the plan is not being force-fed

875
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,278
it may not be necessary to actually

876
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,959
flush in that type of environment

877
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,960
i am open to feedback i'm open to

878
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,798
opinions i'm open to education

879
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,079
i am not the definitive answer of

880
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,679
cannabis uh

881
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,158
i'm still learning just like you but

882
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,278
these are my opinions and my experience

883
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,360
i think if you're using bottled

884
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,359
nutrients absolutely do flush

885
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,439
if you're not using buffered chelated

886
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,439
nutrients if you got a super soil

887
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
maybe it's not necessary to flush i'm

888
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
not going to tell you not to flush

889
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,319
i don't know for sure now let's talk

890
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,919
about

891
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,639
something that i honestly i don't have

892
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,360
the

893
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
uh real scientific botanical biological

894
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,879
education

895
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,720
to open this can of worms but here is

896
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
how my brain thinks about it

897
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,519
um the things we have fed the plant

898
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,159
aren't in that plant as

899
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,119
nitrogen potassium phosphorus calmag

900
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
molybdenum

901
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,678
that stuff has been converted into plant

902
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,599
material plant matter

903
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,840
biomass if you will it has been

904
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,798
photosynthesized and processed into

905
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,319
stuff

906
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:16,000
um if i went and i ate uh

907
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,798
7 000 [ __ ] snickers bars today

908
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
if you eat me if you smoke me it's not

909
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,319
burning snickers bars

910
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,919
there's not snickers bars are not me i'm

911
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,798
not snickers bars i am

912
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,640
rasta jeff i am jeff i have converted

913
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,879
all of those snickers bars into

914
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
biomass it's either fat it's fat it's

915
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
all it's gonna it's [ __ ] fat and

916
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,519
diabetes is what it's going to be and

917
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,080
the rest of it was a poop

918
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,960
so i've converted into a turd and

919
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,398
biomass

920
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,640
you're not going to find snickers bars

921
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,038
in me for like maybe like for like an

922
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,720
hour

923
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,319
after i eat it you might find pieces of

924
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,519
snickers bars you'll identify peanuts

925
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,519
for a real long time

926
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,798
but i think the plants aren't gonna have

927
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,918
if you feed the plants snickers bars

928
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,359
they're not gonna [ __ ] have snickers

929
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
bars hanging off the branches it's gonna

930
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,759
break down snickers bars it's gonna kill

931
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,359
your plant but

932
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,798
follow me what i'm saying here it's not

933
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,918
gonna be snickers bars in the plant it's

934
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,480
gonna metabolize

935
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,038
and turn into biomass and plant matter

936
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,079
leaves

937
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,919
stalks buds trichomes shoots

938
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,519
terpenes it's going to turn at esters

939
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
paleous is going to turn into all kinds

940
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,440
of [ __ ]

941
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,880
sugars so i don't know

942
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,880
that what are we flushing out what are

943
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
you trying to do you can only

944
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,720
like if i tried to flush me i can only

945
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
pee and poop so much and only so much is

946
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,798
gonna come out

947
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
after that i'm just gonna piss and [ __ ]

948
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,960
pure water uh

949
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
what you can't then am i gonna smoke

950
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
better am i gonna burn better i don't

951
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,558
know so i don't know what you're trying

952
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
to get out

953
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,759
you're trying to flush out nutrients but

954
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,559
they're in the leaves they're in the

955
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,599
stalks

956
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,558
the buds have become buds it has turned

957
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,599
all of your

958
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:44,480
building blocks of life into a plant

959
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,240
so flushing is controversial and i wish

960
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
i wish i had some science to back up the

961
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,359
part i'm talking about now there are

962
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
people that have much better education

963
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,918
than me on that

964
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,319
and i'm willing to admit you guys i'm

965
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,840
not the most uh book and school educator

966
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,278
when it comes to cannabis but i [ __ ]

967
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,558
done it i put my hands on the plants

968
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,839
i've done a lot of things that's why i

969
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,519
feel that i'm credible

970
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,038
not to discredit the school guys i need

971
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,480
one of the school guys to back me up on

972
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,519
this question but

973
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,159
in my opinion definitely flush with uh

974
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,679
salt nutrients hydro something like that

975
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,000
maybe you don't need to flush if you're

976
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,880
running

977
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
organics my question to you is uh what

978
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
are you trying to flush out what are we

979
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,960
trying to do

980
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,399
we want to clean rhizo rhizosphere so

981
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,079
that the plants don't have a bunch of

982
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,599
stuff in them when we smoke it if you

983
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,798
don't overfeed it if you didn't over

984
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,038
fertilize

985
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,879
it should burn cleanly at the end maybe

986
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,000
do an experiment maybe grow one plant

987
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,399
and don't flush it

988
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
and grow one plant and flush for 14 days

989
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,918
dry and cure exactly the same

990
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,599
let's smoke them at the end and see

991
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,880
let's see if we really can tell let's

992
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,079
see if that [ __ ] we're blaming that

993
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,159
crunchy ash on

994
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,199
is something else other than just a

995
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,039
basic flush

996
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
that's my two cents on that part i do

997
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,839
have some feedback on one other avenue

998
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,880
of this question

999
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,000
um i do know that we had

1000
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,440
a commercial grow that had

1001
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,359
an incident i can't get into their

1002
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,440
business we had to harvest a room a

1003
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,199
little bit early and the plants in one

1004
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
section did not get to get flushed we

1005
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,759
thought we had more time

1006
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,440
uh things went wrong uh had to cut down

1007
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,278
we decided instead of trying to sell

1008
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,120
these unflushed flowers that we would

1009
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,200
freeze it and turn it into fresh frozen

1010
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,359
live resin

1011
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
that [ __ ] came out amazing we could not

1012
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,439
tell that those plants had not been

1013
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,320
flushed

1014
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,000
the live resin they came from just not

1015
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,398
even flush those plants probably got

1016
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,200
fed that day and they got cut down they

1017
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,278
got froze

1018
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,278
they got turned into concentrates and it

1019
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,919
tasted [ __ ] beautiful so

1020
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,720
we did not notice anything in the fresh

1021
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,720
frozen

1022
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,079
live resin from plants that were not

1023
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
flushed that's the only thing i can

1024
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,918
testify to

1025
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,519
in that department so i wish i had a

1026
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,799
more definitive answer to you but i hope

1027
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,639
i sparked your mind

1028
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,000
i gave you a little bit of guidance i

1029
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,960
want to know what do we think we're

1030
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,640
flushing out

1031
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
like i keep saying all the stuff we fed

1032
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,960
the plant became the plant

1033
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,558
it didn't become like little bags of

1034
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
phosphorus and potassium hanging off the

1035
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,440
plant it's not moving around as that

1036
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
still

1037
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,640
it's a plant now so there's a lot to

1038
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,399
think about there i will continue to

1039
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,480
read i will always continue to educate

1040
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,518
myself on cannabis and when i do have

1041
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,880
a real solid definitive answer on this i

1042
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,000
will be here on the show to talk about

1043
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,200
it maybe i'll bring somebody on the show

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,440
