1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,379
hey what's up podcast world it is time

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,139
for episode 427 of the growth from your

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,250
heart podcast no long fancy intro no ads

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,410
we're not gonna talk about what I'm

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,609
smoking no patreon shoutouts we're gonna

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,789
get right down to business

7
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,980
today I am frequently a guest on a show

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,259
called embracing organics embracing

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,929
organics is of course an organic based

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,970
cannabis growing podcast that is found

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,278
on YouTube we record the show on

12
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,379
Thursdays at 7 p.m. mountain time I

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,910
encourage you to join us I am on the

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,230
show quite frequently I like to talk

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,920
about growing and I like to talk about

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,450
breeding

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,340
but even when I'm not there it is still

18
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,160
a great podcast and the boys have a

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,320
great time on the most recent episode I

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,878
brought up a great topic that I wanted

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,460
to cut from their show with their

22
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,769
permission and replay here on my podcast

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,239
I don't feel like it requires a lot of

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,859
setup because I do a pretty good

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,109
explanation in the rant that I was

26
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,000
delivering I will also be back at the

27
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,500
end of that recording to deliver some

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,230
fresh information that I've discovered

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,939
since that original recording so ladies

30
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,948
and gentlemen with no further ado let's

31
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,978
time travel back to last Thursday and

32
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,310
revisit my rant about Philo's bioscience

33
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:10,500
on the embracing organics podcast

34
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,000
[Music]

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,500
[Applause]

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,450
[Music]

37
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,829
there's dead air silence the thing that

38
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,600
has been popular in the cannabis

39
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,920
community that I haven't touched on yet

40
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,539
seems to be the the FiOS galaxy news

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,590
that has come to light lately sorry I

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,530
sound distracted I'm getting a dad

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,829
together I know you get your dad

44
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,780
together and you know I'm kind of gonna

45
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,548
play a little devil's advocate here but

46
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,320
personally I haven't dude I haven't

47
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,630
looked into anything about this Philo

48
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,629
stuff you know as far as I know from

49
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,158
what I've seen on Instagram and blah

50
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,868
blah blah blah people are claiming that

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
they're stealing genetics they're

52
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,799
claiming that you know they're taking

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,959
their stuff and heading for the hills

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,570
with it I'm seeing a lot of like you

55
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,069
know oh FiOS is doing this file is is

56
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,739
doing that but I haven't really dug

57
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:08,189
anything up I haven't got any my own

58
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,919
research so you seem to know a little

59
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,719
bit about what's going on so go ahead

60
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,309
and inform me well there's

61
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,000
to it and a lot of it a lot of the

62
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,170
reaction is kind of Miss information and

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,639
the cannabis industry loves a nice

64
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,109
witch-hunt we love to hang someone out

65
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,299
to dry as soon as we hear somebody say

66
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,220
something that ruffles our feathers I

67
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,260
tried not to get involved in that

68
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,710
feather ruffling and tried to kind of

69
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:34,449
wait and see how it unfolded the big

70
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,180
misconception that I see people seem to

71
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:40,389
think that Philo's has our plants they

72
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,400
think that we sent them clones or small

73
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:45,069
babies or something that they have made

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,870
a tissue culture or a clone of that is

75
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,639
not the case they do not have our plants

76
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,950
they have got our genetic data is

77
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,569
basically what they have when you send

78
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,549
material to Philo so you don't send them

79
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,319
a plant you take a small card that

80
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,790
unfolds you rub part of the plant

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,799
material in there to get the juices out

82
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,150
of the plant you fold it back up and you

83
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,830
send it to them just the same way that

84
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,370
you spit into a little package for

85
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,040
23andme it is the same process 23andme

86
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,480
can't they maybe they could but 23andme

87
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,219
doesn't have my arm I didn't have to

88
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,409
send them part of my arm for them to get

89
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,569
my my DNA you don't send them a plant

90
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,129
you send them this juice is basically so

91
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,620
they don't have our plants they can't

92
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,169
regenerate our plants from the small

93
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,819
amount of data we gave them what they do

94
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:30,399
have is the genetic marker of all of our

95
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,259
plants so now they know what makes up

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,060
each plant what they do have is an

97
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,879
advantage now they have already seen

98
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,349
basically what happens if you breed

99
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,150
almost all of the popular cultivars that

100
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,680
are out there they have seen it bred to

101
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,530
all of the other cultivars and they've

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,120
got a really good predictive chart and a

103
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,909
map and a kind of a cheat code

104
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,230
inbreeding that is that's basically to

105
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,659
my understanding what they have done

106
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:56,590
their intention to my understanding is

107
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:58,090
not to take our plants and reproduce

108
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,060
them they want to use the info that we

109
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,709
have provided to breed better plants for

110
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,239
the future in their opinion better

111
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,830
plants for the future I don't know how

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,810
that is gonna go I can't speak for their

113
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,700
intention there but from what they have

114
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,050
released they don't have our stuff they

115
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,389
can't steal our stuff they're gonna use

116
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,890
our data because we all sent them our

117
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,019
plants with the agree you sign an

118
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:19,750
agreement saying that they can use your

119
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,519
data they can use it for science they

120
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,079
can reproduce it there's a long list of

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,550
things you allow them to do when you

122
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,399
send them your material so we gave them

123
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,009
permission to do this also when you say

124
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,899
and a scientist or a laboratory any sort

125
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,490
of material they're not storing it and

126
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,019
doing you a favor they're going to use

127
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,460
that that is part of their job that is

128
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,948
what science is for you don't get into a

129
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,478
science industry to just collect data

130
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,370
you want to do something with that data

131
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,689
so that's what they did I know they're

132
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,300
looking to breed with that they're going

133
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,439
to use our research years and this is

134
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,870
what is kind of frustrating the

135
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,459
community we have spent years doing this

136
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,560
somebody in the chat earlier said that

137
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:55,779
they have done what a small family of

138
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,759
breeders would have done in several

139
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,529
years they've got all of that data to

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,240
themselves what the entire cannabis

141
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,038
community has done over years they've

142
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,930
got all of that data to themselves and

143
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,870
they charged us to get it they charge

144
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,209
you 250 to 300 dollars per submission to

145
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,160
enter a strain into their galaxy so they

146
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,750
charged us money they put our strains

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,400
into their galaxy now they're using that

148
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,870
data to their advantage that is what

149
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,579
it's kind of pissing off a lot of

150
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,819
growers and breeders and the industry as

151
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,469
a breeder I'm not worried they if and

152
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,579
when they do get to breeding and

153
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,860
creating their own strains that are

154
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,329
going to hire breeders who were people

155
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,250
just like us who have experience with

156
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,079
plants they're going to pay those people

157
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,250
to do projects that are charted out

158
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,978
they're gonna have instructions to

159
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,370
follow that's how breeding happens they

160
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:42,189
are going to be Budweiser or Walmart and

161
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,389
I'm always gonna be whoever I don't even

162
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,949
know the smaller one to compare to I'm

163
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,509
always gonna be mom-and-pop and people

164
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,250
are always gonna there's gonna be a

165
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,050
choice a lot of people go to Walmart a

166
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,089
lot of people by Budweiser but so many

167
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,199
people want that mom-and-pop stuff so

168
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,689
I'm not worried about it I think there's

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,848
integrity in good breeding I think what

170
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,168
they're doing in a way it helps the

171
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,759
movement it helps the industry it helps

172
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,740
the plant we're going to develop they

173
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,199
are going to develop plants that will be

174
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,288
they say more resistant to bugs more

175
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,330
resistant to pathogens more resistant to

176
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:12,879
mildew and molds and they claim that

177
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:16,149
they'll be able to dial in specific

178
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,459
strains to have very specific terpene

179
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,109
profiles to where if you want cheesecake

180
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,788
you can breed a strain that tastes like

181
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,879
cheesecake or you can breed one that

182
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:27,250
tastes like public knowledge that

183
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,079
another breeder could use their data and

184
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,120
do the same thing and choose the parents

185
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,800
that they want because there's that kind

186
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
of like a public thing it's not or do

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,418
they have grown like you think they

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,129
recommend if you explore their their

189
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:41,139
galaxy there are spaces where they

190
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:42,819
recommend breeding specific

191
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,650
strains together they say nobody has

192
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,509
done this yet and since these strains

193
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,248
are so far apart in our galaxy we

194
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,528
recommend a breeding them because it

195
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,789
would make unique phenotypes is

196
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,949
something that they actually send that

197
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,399
to you when you file strains with their

198
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,718
galaxy

199
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,399
they'll make those recommendations for

200
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:58,959
you and they actually suggested

201
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,299
something that I had already done they

202
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,098
recommended I crossed first they said

203
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,020
Girl Scout cookies to grateful dog and I

204
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:07,209
had already done it they also suggested

205
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:09,459
I crossed the space clean to my grateful

206
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,498
dog and I had already done that so they

207
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,388
were they were predicting things that I

208
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,370
was going to do they were predicting my

209
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:21,389
moves that I had been planning through

210
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:23,319
science they saw it before I did as a

211
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,300
breeder you know a lot of the

212
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,718
information they have is lineage breed

213
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,360
or living it's information besides a lot

214
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:34,689
of unknown cultivars you know where you

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,348
don't know the lineage most of the data

216
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,419
was out there um you know before you as

217
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,788
a breeder before you take upon any

218
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:45,188
project you do your research and do what

219
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,870
you're crossing you don't just go oh

220
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,718
this looks pretty and this looks pretty

221
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,478
and slap them together hopefully yeah

222
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:54,490
hopefully there's a long process behind

223
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,459
it and the information was out there and

224
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,550
is out there and you know you find your

225
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,918
lineages you see how those have been

226
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,468
grown out and what the result and you

227
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,838
make your best educated you know

228
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:11,019
decision based off of the data that you

229
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:14,800
you draw they've just drawn a ton of

230
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,228
data and brought it into one spot a ton

231
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,389
of data and here's the thing like

232
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:21,399
everybody forgets how many active

233
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:24,460
compounds of Canada this plant itself

234
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:27,610
has and every seed is a little different

235
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,579
than the other seed that you germinate

236
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,440
and they make me similar but they're

237
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,299
still different compounds are a little

238
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,789
bit higher in each one so for them to

239
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,799
really take that and say hey this is

240
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,809
what we're gonna create they still don't

241
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,198
know exactly what all compounds they're

242
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,698
gonna find they have an idea but they

243
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:48,099
don't know for sure and that's what

244
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:52,028
they're looking for 13:30 I like the

245
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,800
fact compared them to like wiser or like

246
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,360
you know like a miller or something you

247
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,289
know I mean like I

248
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,990
really big just broad industry and you

249
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:03,539
know me personally I'm not a drinker but

250
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,759
I would much rather go to a small

251
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:09,149
brewery I would much rather support a

252
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,828
small poem brewer versus like a big

253
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,240
corporation like Miller I mean dude

254
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:14,669
there's tons of people out there that

255
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,919
want that stuff that are perfectly happy

256
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:18,990
and fine with that hey what's going on

257
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,088
humidor through this hey guys the

258
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,740
embracing organics podcast is recorded

259
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,440
live on Google Hangouts which gives the

260
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,600
opportunity for guests to come and go at

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,100
different points of the show sometimes I

262
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
have to leave the show early sometimes I

263
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,009
show up for the show late at this point

264
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,379
in the show we were joined by another

265
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,389
friend I'll be politely greeted him we

266
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,070
said hello to him for a few minutes we

267
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,659
let him talk about where he was he was

268
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,740
at a new cannabis club we let him hype

269
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,019
that up for a few minutes

270
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,079
he politely said goodbye then we

271
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,820
continued on with our talk about Philo's

272
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,799
dirt man dan seem to remember exactly

273
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,600
where he was so let's just let him pick

274
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,240
up right where he left off ladies and

275
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,339
gentlemen here is dirt man Dan but yeah

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,409
like I was saying earlier I like the

277
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,390
fact that like Jeff was comparing these

278
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,189
guys to like a big corporation like a

279
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,610
Walmart or a Miller or something like

280
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,310
that

281
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,480
I guess they're their is their place for

282
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:11,729
it but me being the person I am I like

283
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,860
supporting the small mom-and-pop shops

284
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,449
even though there is that giant

285
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,940
corporation right down the street and

286
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,609
I'm gonna wind up spending more at the

287
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,019
mom-and-pop shop but I know at the end

288
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,789
of the day I'm probably getting a better

289
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,929
quality product and that makes me

290
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,789
happier well I think some of the issues

291
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,069
too were as people weren't getting

292
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:35,039
credit for some of these genetics that

293
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,949
people sold over the years and people

294
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,980
wanted to know what really was going on

295
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:43,319
and who really had what to begin with

296
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,310
and this kind of helps sort through some

297
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,899
of that oh yeah now we can see we can

298
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,159
trace it back through DNA we can see

299
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,559
well that came from this came from this

300
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,759
came from this or no we're we have more

301
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,889
opportunity to find out what

302
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,539
oh gee really is we're gonna find out

303
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,899
what oh gee cush really is where it came

304
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,669
from

305
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,179
we'll find out if all these different

306
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:05,159
different named oh geez the sfv the

307
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,419
original oh gee all the different ones

308
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,039
we'll find out if they're the same cut

309
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,240
or if they came from the same sea

310
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,309
stock we'll be able to narrow that down

311
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,709
and in that rumor which will be really

312
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:15,689
cool for the cannabis world yeah because

313
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:18,778
everybody swears they have a cut of the

314
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,209
OG or you know I got og this I got og

315
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:24,809
that dude it don't matter where you're

316
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:26,729
at somebody's got yo gee yeah but is it

317
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,859
that original og because there are so

318
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,449
many OGS back in the day there's the sfb

319
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,970
and then there's the Tahoe and they're

320
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:38,669
probably very similar yeah exactly

321
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,399
supposedly the one group like so many

322
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:47,879
different variances and Fino expressions

323
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:49,440
that came out of that plants being

324
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,110
handed down and down from generation

325
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
generation just also gets lost to yes

326
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,100
somebody will click somebody will you

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,559
know forget what it is and then make up

328
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,970
a name and we've been growing that for

329
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:07,349
forever it doesn't matter what the name

330
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,490
is people forgot I think that in your

331
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,430
neighborhood there's a guy over there

332
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,350
sellin OG Kush and everyone's buying OG

333
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,958
Kush but I need mine to be different so

334
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,159
I'm gonna call it Jeff's og now mine's a

335
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,479
little bit more expensive and you want

336
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,429
to buy Jeff's OG because it's that new

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:31,528
hot [ __ ] so we just got to rename it and

338
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:33,059
that's how a lot of that happens on your

339
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,578
channel change the name of them

340
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,318
something like we don't want people to

341
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:40,259
know what this is and where it came from

342
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:42,599
like oh okay like I was saying before

343
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,019
the show I see a lot of this stuff as

344
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,959
the inevitable and like I'm hoping for

345
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,860
federal legalization honestly I mean I

346
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,289
want to be able to grow these plants

347
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,870
like they're Tomatoes you know I want

348
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:57,629
everyone to be able to have access to it

349
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,938
though that needs or want access to it

350
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:04,610
as long as they're you know an adult and

351
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:09,269
responsible with their life whatever but

352
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,750
my whole point is like this is only the

353
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,889
inevitable of when legalization comes in

354
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,669
because you're gonna have companies like

355
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,470
bear you know big [ __ ] like FiOS is tiny

356
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:21,179
you're gonna have big [ __ ] boys

357
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,220
coming in and

358
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,199
thrown down you know intellectual

359
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,350
property rights all over [ __ ] trying to

360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,240
you know patent these strains and stuff

361
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,490
and they're gonna have some real money

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,769
to throw at it and then people are

363
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,299
really gonna be [ __ ] it's like this that

364
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,769
people are freaking out over nothing

365
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:44,429
right now go over some some data because

366
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:46,409
that's all Philo's has data yeah but I

367
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:48,779
think it's gonna be too hard to patent

368
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:54,389
this plant itself there's too many

369
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:56,459
variables to it gonna do besides hurt

370
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,409
maybe they're trying to be legal you're

371
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,540
gonna put some sort of tracer in there

372
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,730
and they're gonna let their [ __ ] grow

373
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,949
and their pollens gonna [ __ ] fly or

374
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,980
something and then they're gonna come in

375
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:13,250
your field find you know seed and your

376
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,250
[ __ ] crop from with their genetic

377
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:18,349
yeah see you know that's what Monsanto

378
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,930
farms because of all this [ __ ] yeah so

379
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,980
at this point in the show we kind of

380
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,959
drifted off into a different

381
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,580
conversation there are about six people

382
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,350
in the Y feed at this point so it does

383
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,330
get a little bit hectic I chose to cut

384
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,000
out at this point you can hear the full

385
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,700
unedited version of that podcast on the

386
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,789

00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:03,419
more to talk about here with the Philo's

397
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,579
galaxy controversy as stabby and med fit

398
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,979
touched on there are things to think

399
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,379
about like intellectual property a lot

400
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,990
of breeders a lot of creators of very

401
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,509
popular strains sent their information

402
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,610
to Philo's they have now got our data

403
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,350
they have got our intellectual property

404
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,539
they are going to use our intellectual

405
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,850
property to further their breeding

406
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,319
projects there are a lot of different

407
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,000
ways to think about this you can think

408
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,080
about this as your aren't being used you

409
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,059
can think about it as your business

410
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,950
being used there are a lot of different

411
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,839
approaches to come at this subject I'm

412
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,290
trying to come at it from all angles and

413
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,940
keep a clear head and a

414
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:40,629
in mind said I can relay the information

415
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,639
properly without being biased a recent

416
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,230
rumor or allegation that has been flying

417
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,409
through the cannabis community and

418
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,509
social media is that Philo's bioscience

419
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:51,879
may possibly be linked up with a company

420
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:54,519
in Israel who is actively working to

421
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:57,220
patent specific cannabis strains or

422
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,560
variety so that is something that would

423
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,290
be really shitty and shady of them to do

424
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,969
we gave them our plant data now they are

425
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:07,299
using that data to create their own

426
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,250
patents that is again an allegation and

427
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,500
a rumor that I will look more into and I

428
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,419
will report more information to you as

429
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,789
it does come to light there is a lot of

430
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,799
information coming out very quickly the

431
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:19,750
owner and spokesperson of Philo's

432
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:22,359
bioscience has been scheduled to appear

433
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,028
and speak on numerous podcasts this past

434
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,250
week but as expected he has backed out

435
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:29,679
at the last moment for every interview

436
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,328
he has scheduled so when I do find more

437
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,489
information I will update you with that

438
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:35,229
information and I will keep you guys in

439
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,350
the loop as to what is happening with

440
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,819
Philo's bioscience as I'm wrapping up

441
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,560

442
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:43,360

445
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,440

446
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:53,049

452
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,289

453
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:10,359
leaders with Mowgli that's the video you

454
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:13,328
want to watch Mowgli speaks for almost

455
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,519
an hour about the things he said in that

456
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:17,168
controversial YouTube video that

457
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,168
controversial Instagram clip that

458
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,339
everybody saw that sparked all of this

459
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:24,100
controversy for his company so I

460
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:26,500
recommend you check out Philo's

461
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,500
bioscience industry leaders with Mowgli

462
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,450
on the soil Kings YouTube channel and of

463
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,609
course give him a subscribe since he's

464
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,200
got such a great video up ladies and

465
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:37,509

466
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,640
to cover for the Philo's bioscience

467
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,408
controversy if I do learn more I will do

468
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,780
my best to present that to you on this

469
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:46,059
podcast I think the conversation between

470
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,849
Mowgli and our friend soil King will

471
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:50,079

472
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,579
