00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,399
and ask if you grow questions i want to

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,399
know

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
the relative humidity the temperature of

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,280
your grow i want to know if you're

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,319
growing indoors and outdoors i want to

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
know what kind of plants you're growing

62
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,679
once you tell me that i give you the

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
opportunity to ask a question then i

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,439
will do my best to use that info to

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
answer your question this one did come

66
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,598
from our friend mike and it goes a lot

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
like this

68
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,280
it says ross to jeff thanks for your

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
response on the show about growing out

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
mother plants yes if you listen uh to

71
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,199
the previous episodes i did talk about

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,479
growing mother plants we had a listener

73
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,318
sent an email and their mother plants

74
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,439
were dying they weren't uh performing

75
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
well when they would put them into

76
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,159
flower i gave some advice this is a

77
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,560
follow-up on that email it says what you

78
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,159
said did make sense i didn't think they

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
were root bound because i trimmed the

80
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,759
root ball and transplanted them from two

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
to three gallon containers before

82
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,039
flipping so that may eliminate one

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
opportunity why they were getting sad

84
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,639
but it says the real question is i have

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
grown out four different cultivars and

86
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,318
only one of them just straight dies

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,840
every time

88
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,759
i'm not sure why that's happening i'm

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,519
not sure uh there are so many anomalies

90
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,199
so many variables here that i'm not

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
exactly sure what's happening but he

92
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,399
does go on to say because of low yields

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
i don't think i will waste time growing

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
out the mothers anymore that is a good

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
idea unless you are planning and

96
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,479
prepping from the beginning to grow out

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
those mothers it may be best just to

98
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,199
retire them toss them use them as clone

99
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
donors then set them to the side trash

100
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,798
them put them in the compost bin you

101
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,479
don't have to use everything that is

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
something that um

103
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,479
i enjoy and i admire i respect and

104
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,158
appreciate the idea that people want to

105
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,119
use everything that comes from their

106
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,598
garden

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
i appreciate that but it's not always

108
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,359
necessary sometimes you're going to

109
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,039
spend more time energy money

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
resources on trying to make something

111
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,479
out of your waist then you could have

112
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,000
just thrown it away and actually not

113
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,759
spent that money you're not going to get

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,719
much out of it sometimes if you don't

115
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,158
have anything to do if you're just

116
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,680
looking for something to do on saturday

117
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,079
you want to figure out how to turn all

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,438
this wasted leaf into a juice that may

119
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
be something to do but most of the time

120
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,719
it is not worth it sometimes we got to

121
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,039
bite the bullet and throw things away

122
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,400
don't you don't have to use everything i

123
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,679
appreciate it and i respect it but

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
sometimes it's not worth your time

125
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
energy effort you end up spending more

126
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,560
energy more time

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,239
buying more equipment and then what you

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
get isn't worth the output you could

129
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,358
have just gone to the dispensary

130
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
possibly and bought that for a few bucks

131
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,798
sometimes once again you don't have to

132
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,159
use everything i do admire that you're

133
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,159
trying to use those mother plants but it

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
may be time to put them in the compost

135
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
bin and realize they have done what they

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
needed to do for you thank you for the

137
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
follow-up bro um it is crazy that you're

138
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,319
up potting them and they are still not

139
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
acting right maybe uh the pot is

140
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,279
shocking them there are so many

141
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
variables that i just don't know what to

142
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,879
tell you send me more info send me more

143
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
details or it looks like you may have

144
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,719
just given up on the idea altogether

145
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,360
let's move forward that's all we can do

146
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,240
from here this one says ross to jeff i

147
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
have a quick question if i may you guys

148
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,439
i'm going to read this one because uh

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
we'll just read it then we'll talk about

150
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,839
it it says what would happen if i

151
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
pollinized and it does say pollenized uh

152
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,000
the word is pollinated what would happen

153
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,799
if i pollenized a male plant with

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,399
another male's pollen would it be f1s

155
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
with trait from both males just like a

156
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,959
male and female breeding project

157
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
um i'm not even as then it says cheers

158
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,239
and kiss your mama then it says if it's

159
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
worth it you can mention my name i'm not

160
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,519
going to mention your name but thank you

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,519
for the great message i do want to uh

162
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,799
explain this this is a good question

163
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,079
although this is a very um honestly i'm

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
not sure if i'm being trolled to be

165
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,879
quite honest with you but i'm going to

166
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,639
answer this like a serious question you

167
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,600
may be trolling me this may be a real

168
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
question

169
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
uh male plants cannot receive pollen

170
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,478
male plants only give pollen female

171
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,478
plants receive the pollen so

172
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,079
you could pollenize a male with another

173
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,038
male all you want and all you're going

174
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,879
to get is a male plant with more pollen

175
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,279
dusted on it nothing is going to happen

176
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,319
except a pollinated mess you're going to

177
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,559
have a bunch of pollen you're going to

178
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,159
sneeze you're going to need to clean up

179
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
nothing will happen if you put male

180
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,639
pollen from a male plant onto another

181
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,839
male plant male plants cannot receive

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
pollen they don't have pistols they

183
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,279
don't have ovules they don't have all

184
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,679
the parts needed to make seeds

185
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,000
that is like two dudes rubbing wieners

186
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
two piles of semen two piles of sperm

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,439
doesn't make anything you need an egg

188
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
you need a sperm to make that happen

189
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,319
male female basic biology basic breeding

190
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,918
that is how plants work as well

191
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
there are variables we can do weird

192
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,079
things with plants but with two male

193
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,360
plants ah we're just touching peepees

194
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,279
and this isn't gonna work you're not

195
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
gonna do anything this is a sword fight

196
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,038
as all this is my friend it says the

197
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,478
reason for my question is i have two

198
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,478
male plants from different strains and

199
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,758
both have unique traits and as a mad

200
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,279
scientist i like new weird projects um i

201
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,560
would pick one of those males and use it

202
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,799
and throw the other one away that would

203
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,879
be my advice pick your favorite use it

204
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,319
toss the other one or use them

205
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,918
separately you do have to pollinate

206
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
female plants so maybe get a female

207
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,359
plant do one cycle of pollen from male a

208
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,478
do another run it's got to be a totally

209
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
separate run you got to finish the

210
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,879
plants cut it down dry it cure it then

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
do a different plant plant b pollinate

212
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,399
that with the same meal and see what

213
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,319
that male is offering to your mix but

214
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,159
the bottom line here is this is basic

215
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
biology um

216
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
i'm really not sure if i'm being trolled

217
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,959
and if not i apologize i should be

218
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
respectful to everybody this could be a

219
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,918
real question males do not receive

220
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,598
pollen males give pollen females receive

221
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,000
the pollen the things you guys call

222
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,839
hairs uh those are those are pistols

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,478
those are what uh actually receive the

224
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,799
pollen and that pollen will slide down

225
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,159
that little hair uh into more parts of

226
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,598
the plant and make a seed without that

227
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,120
part the seeding cannot happen so um

228
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,079
my friend i hope i answered your

229
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,879
question and i hope um i can encourage

230
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,719
you to read some basic grow books and

231
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,199
basic biology with all due respect

232
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
because there's some basics uh some

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
basic schooling that got skipped there

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
my dude all right thank you for the

235
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,519
great message i'm gonna keep going um

236
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,198
let's see this next one says uh hey ross

237
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,120
to jeff this one came from our friend

238
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,280
spaceman spuff

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
very unique name it says

240
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,839
i just realized okay there's more we're

241
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,520
gonna cut out some of this because there

242
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,119
this is a two-part message

243
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,279
it says i forgot to mention that the

244
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,519
18-6 light cycle for the last seven to

245
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,439
ten days of flower does seem to work for

246
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,198
me as far as bulking up plants that is a

247
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,120
great bit of feedback i have talked

248
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
about in a lot of previous episodes

249
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
about putting our plants are flowering

250
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,399
plants under 18 hours of lighting at the

251
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,079
end of flower 18 on and six off a lot of

252
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,839
people think i'm absolutely freaking

253
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,079
crazy for doing it the people that have

254
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,519
tried it have given me great praise

255
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,959
great feedback and great thanks for

256
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,639
giving them the information because they

257
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,959
are all completely satisfied with the

258
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,278
results of this new technique so the

259
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,958
last seven to ten maybe 10 to 14 days of

260
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,240
the flowering cycle i will return my

261
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,918
lights to an 18-6 cycle 18 hours on six

262
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
hours off that gives the plants more

263
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,918
photons more light energy they do grow

264
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
more quickly they get beefy they get

265
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,240
bulky they do ripen up quite quickly i

266
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,559
think i get more weight and faster when

267
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
i do this so our friend says i forgot to

268
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,000
mention the 18 to 6 light cycle for the

269
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,800
last 10 days of flower does seem to work

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,039
as both as far as bulking up my plants

271
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,479
i'm not sure it did much for one of my

272
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,799
plants but there was a noticeable

273
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,320
bulking up on my other plant especially

274
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,919
on the top main cola yes that's where

275
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
you're going to notice it the most it

276
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,199
goes on it says i just want to know if

277
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
going any longer than 10 days at 18 6

278
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
will cause any problems or cause reveg

279
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,639
also will this cause any problems with

280
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
re-veging so we've got like a three-part

281
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,679
question here which is super great he

282
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
also included some picks dude your

283
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,199
plants look awesome i think i replied

284
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,278
and asked what strain that was because

285
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,278
that top cola looked [ __ ] beefy good

286
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
work dude even if that's not one of my

287
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,799
crosses you did a great job with that

288
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
plant it looks excellent so let's talk

289
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,719
about this our friend is running the 18

290
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,560
6 light cycle um he is curious um

291
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,360
if he wants to know if going longer than

292
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,439
10 days at 186 will cause any problems

293
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,879
or possible re-veging the second or

294
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
maybe third part of the question is will

295
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:53,039
it mess up a revenge if they do intend

296
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:55,679
to re-veg going longer than 10 days

297
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,599
maybe 14 maybe 15 maybe 16 days

298
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,559
shouldn't be a problem you will start to

299
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
see

300
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,799
signs of re-veg before there are any

301
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,240
problems it will look like the buds are

302
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,359
just getting little nubs at the tips

303
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,278
it'll look like little leaves are

304
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
starting to come out at the very first

305
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,078
sign of that i recommend a harvest that

306
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,639
will take probably a minimum of 14 maybe

307
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,039
16 17 days before you will start seeing

308
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,919
that by then by now your plants should

309
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,559
be done unless you started your 18-6

310
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,879
light cycle way too early which is why

311
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,278
sometimes i recommend to run the plants

312
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,799
one time on a normal light cycle before

313
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,720
we do this don't do this with a brand

314
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,240
new plant like i don't know i've never

315
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
dated this girl i don't know what she

316
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
likes normally now i don't know how to

317
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
make things perfect i never learned how

318
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,319
to make it right so i wouldn't do this

319
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,759
the first time on a run with the plan i

320
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
would wait to do this the second maybe

321
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,039
the third run but if you've done it on

322
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,399
the first time and you found that you're

323
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,399
going to take a little bit longer to

324
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
flower just pay attention to those buds

325
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
they may start developing a little it

326
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,278
looks like a fox tail it looks like the

327
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
tip is starting to put out more leaves

328
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,039
that is your first sign of reveg you can

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
chop immediately you won't have any

330
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,360
problems the trichomes may not be where

331
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,399
you want them to be but you can harvest

332
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
at this point

333
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,639
re-vegging doesn't happen like instantly

334
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,480
like overnight you see it start to pop

335
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,159
up on a couple of buds probably smaller

336
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
buds toward the bottom you'll see it

337
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,519
start to happen and then you'll say oh

338
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
[ __ ] they're going to reveg you can cut

339
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
everything down at that time it will not

340
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,799
be a problem the buds may not look it

341
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
completely perfect but you'll see it

342
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,799
before it is problematic and then just

343
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,719
cut down now if the plants aren't ready

344
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,719
by that point they should be because

345
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,399
they've been under 18 6 for 10 14 16 17

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
maybe 20 days at this point

347
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,639
and now they are definitely going to

348
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,639
start finishing more quickly so um the

349
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,759
first part of the question was will 18 6

350
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,519
cause problems um i don't think so um

351
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,519
only if you go for too long and then it

352
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,440
says will it cause or re-vegging that is

353
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
the only problem i assume you may run

354
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
into and that is if you go for extremely

355
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,320
too long the third part of this question

356
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
is will it cause any problems with the

357
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,760
re-veg cycle no this will actually

358
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,919
encourage and increase the success of

359
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,159
your re-veging cycle think about it now

360
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,958
we are already starting the re-veg

361
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,719
process 10 to 14 days before we harvest

362
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,479
the plan is already being told some

363
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
weird shit's going on our life cycle

364
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
changed we may need to make some

365
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,360
adjustments the hormones will start

366
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,279
shifting it'll start making differences

367
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,639
within its uh within within the plant

368
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,519
that the plants will change in the plant

369
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,600
it'll show you about 10 or 14 days later

370
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,759
then what we don't cut down if we leave

371
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,320
that that plant has already technically

372
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,480
been in reveg the start of reveg for two

373
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
weeks you will get your revenge success

374
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,680
much more quickly than most of your

375
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,680
other re-veg attempts so i think it will

376
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,679
increase the luck of your reveg i think

377
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,159
it'll make your plants bulkier and i do

378
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,039
not think you will run into any problems

379
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,319
unless of course you started this way

380
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,679
too early all right my friend spaceman

flower grower in a illegal state got a

399
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,760
lot of genetics i want to run and i have

400
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,040
a bunch to run but i don't have the time

401
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,600
to run clone and sex all of them what

402
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,958
would you do that is a great uh good

403
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
question right there it says i've built

404
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,239
a heligrow started okay he talks a lot

405
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,159
about his grow which we don't need to

406
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
talk too much about right now but the

407
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,559
question is our friend has let's see

408
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
what's the word here i have a bunch to

409
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,719
run and i don't have time to run them

410
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,000
clone them and sex them all what would

411
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,079
you do i definitely as a seed breeder

412
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,480
maybe a seed hoarder definitely a seed

413
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,799
collector i may understand this problem

414
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,039
of having a lot of seeds and not having

415
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,039
the uh time space energy [ __ ]

416
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,679
resources basically the space and

417
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,198
honestly the legal capacity to run as

418
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,000
many numbers as i would like to run if

419
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,439
it were up to me i'd be running uh 500

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,120
small plants at a time that wouldn't

421
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
take up very much room but legally i

422
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,879
cannot do that i'm limited to 12 here in

423
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,799
the state of colorado so

424
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,720
what would i do that's a very good

425
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,958
question what would i do if i wanted to

426
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
grow a bunch of stuff out uh find the

427
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,239
keepers find the winners and see what

428
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,919
i've got that's a really good question

429
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,360
it's kind of all about your goal i say

430
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,278
that quite often

431
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,440
anything and growing is about your goal

432
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,198
what's your goal do you want to build a

433
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,079
big stable of keepers do you want to

434
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,319
find

435
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,479
just a few mommies for yourself are you

436
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
looking to fill a greenhouse or a

437
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,560
commercial grow with a stable for a

438
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,319
medical supply so that you can have a

439
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,000
bunch of strains on a shelf are you

440
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,000
looking to become a breeder what are

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
your goals are you growing for you are

442
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,519
you growing for patients are you growing

443
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
for the market uh what are you growing

444
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,198
for that is going to be the first

445
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
question here how many moms do you need

446
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,120
how many different varietals do you

447
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,278
actually need around why do you need so

448
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
many that's things i just ask questions

449
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,838
because that makes you think and then

450
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
you can answer your own question for

451
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,560
yourself and maybe figure things out

452
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,399
without me getting too involved but um

453
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,919
always have a goal what are you trying

454
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,360
to do what are you looking for are you

455
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,439
trying to find keepers are you just

456
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,519
trying to see what you made again i'm

457
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,399
not sure what the ultimate goal here is

458
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
but what would i do i would set a goal i

459
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,919
would know what i'm looking for then i

460
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
would pop seeds

461
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,759
depending on the numbers of plants which

462
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
you were allowed to have that would

463
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,399
dictate how many seeds i pop if it were

464
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,519
unlimited i would pop as many as i could

465
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,078
possibly manage um i would do hundreds

466
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,639
500. i would like to do 500 seeds if i

467
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,479
possibly could i don't know your

468
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
environment your situation your setup i

469
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
don't know how brave you are i don't

470
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
know if you want to follow the law i

471
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
don't know if you want to break the law

472
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
i can't encourage or promote you to do

473
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,560
anything like that but if it were up to

474
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,719
me i would run a bunch of small small

475
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,479
plants um

476
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,480
there are several ways to do it i would

477
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,959
run let's say i would get a tr i've got

478
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
a tray that uh fits um when i was

479
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,399
working the commercial grows these

480
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,799
little trays i would buy would hold 25

481
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,879
24 plants perfectly so four of those

482
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,799
trays was basically a hundred plants a

483
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,480
hundred cups i could put beer cups in

484
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,879
there so now i could grow a hundred beer

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,399
cups under one small light and i can see

486
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,120
a lot of stuff from a seed line if you

487
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,039
run 100 seeds from a line of seeds you

488
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,039
will definitely see a lot of expression

489
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,480
in that batch of seeds first of all

490
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,838
you're going to cull about 50 of them so

491
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,399
there's two trays that are gone right

492
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
away now we're down to 48 plants um now

493
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,278
i'm down to my females because we're

494
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,120
going to eliminate the males now we're

495
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,799
going to start seeing the dominant

496
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,639
phenotypes which phenotypes really

497
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,240
express themselves you'll see

498
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
the keepers the not keepers you'll see

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,919
the traits uh you'll see if there are

500
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,919
any sex trade or enter any intersex

501
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,399
traits any hermaphroditic traits any

502
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,479
weirdos any mutants any anomalies any

503
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,078
standouts any anything that you do

504
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,278
notice anything you do love anything you

505
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,359
do hate you're going to notice that

506
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,278
within a hundred seeds that will you'll

507
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,919
definitely notice that so i would run a

508
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,000
hundred of them then uh keep an eye take

509
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,078
notes number them label all of them then

510
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
when you're done uh don't harvest

511
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,838
everything leave enough there to where

512
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,519
you can re-veg your favorite one also if

513
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,759
you're if you've got that many seeds and

514
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,439
you see something in a pack of 100

515
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,359
you're probably going to be able to find

516
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
it again as the breeder as the person

517
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,879
that made that pack you could probably

518
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,240
identify that one again in the future

519
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
and be able to find that keeper if you

520
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
found 100 it is there again that's not

521
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,720
going to be super rare you can find that

522
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,558
so i would pop a bunch of seeds i would

523
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,558
hunt through those seeds i would find

524
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,038
the keeper then i would re-veg that

525
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,119
keeper then i would pop another hundred

526
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,119
seeds then i would do it all over again

527
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,798
i would keep doing this until i found

528
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,038
the amount of plants which i needed to

529
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
fill my stable here in colorado i'm

530
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,480
allowed 12 plants i guess i'd work on

531
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
finding like four or five great mom

532
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
plants and then start growing those out

533
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
then every so often i'd run another pack

534
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,319
of seeds and then once you've decided

535
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
your number of mother plants we'll save

536
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,678
five let's we've got five good mom

537
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,679
plants right now you run another pack of

538
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,759
seeds if one of those seeds is better

539
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
than the five you've got call the worst

540
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,119
one of your five keepers and replace it

541
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,359
with that new girl then you've got the

542
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,279
five best all the time so i would pop

543
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,439
seeds i would hunt them i would repeat

544
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,200
and i would build a catalog i would do a

545
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
bunch of small plants because that way

546
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,360
you don't have to worry about cloning

547
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
very small plants that you can re-veg i

548
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,439
talk a lot about re-veging it's very

549
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,918
easy to do and it saves you all that

550
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
time and space of cloning every time you

551
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
clone you basically double your plant

552
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,639
count you double your workload i do

553
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,399
understand so

554
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
if you've got an unlimited plant count i

555
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
would do a bunch of tester runs and cups

556
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,320
that's how i do my testers honestly i do

557
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
them in cups i veg them until they're a

558
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,519
few inches tall depending on the strain

559
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,000
depending on the structure of the plant

560
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,839
then i flip it ah they flower for 70

561
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,599
days and we know what we've got at the

562
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,519
end of 70 days i cut them down leave a

563
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,959
little bit on the bottom re-veg them if

564
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,079
i want to run it again i've got that

565
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,679
plant for future use now one thing i

566
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,960
want to talk about is

567
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,880
um

568
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
it's really fun to run through a [ __ ]

569
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,039
ton of seeds don't get me wrong i love i

570
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
just said i love to run through 500

571
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,400
seeds that's a good time you get to take

572
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
a lot of notes you get to see a lot of

573
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
expressions you get to learn a lot of

574
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,279
[ __ ] about the plants that you have made

575
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,879
but that's also like going on 500 dates

576
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,918
how are you going to remember anything

577
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
how are you going to know if you're

578
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,640
really interested in anything because

579
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
you got 499 others distracting you to

580
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
think about there's a lot of data that's

581
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,480
a lot of info my advice may be one of

582
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,918
the options may be to pick your favorite

583
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,679
batch of seeds what's getting your

584
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,919
attention the most somebody out of all

585
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,360
of the seeds you've got is saying grow

586
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,799
me and you know which one it is you

587
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,159
don't even have to think about it

588
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,319
there's a pack that you've been going i

589
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,440
should grow that grab that pack grow

590
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,119
that pack

591
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,759
grow all of the phenotypes out of there

592
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,159
to the best of your ability grow as many

593
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,240
as you can then narrow it down to about

594
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,640
five of your favorite females out of

595
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
that big population now you got the best

596
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
five grow those again when you grow

597
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
those again narrow it down to your

598
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,759
favorite two or three now it's gonna get

599
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
harder the next time now narrow it down

600
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,400
to your favorite one or two how about

601
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,558
instead of running 500 plants and trying

602
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,519
to find a bunch of keepers why don't we

603
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,399
run

604
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,839
50 100 and find the one keeper really

605
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,759
focus on some plants build a

606
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,839
relationship with these plants it's fun

607
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,359
to grow a lot of [ __ ] but how do you

608
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,119
know that that plant that you're working

609
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,119
with is reaching its potential and

610
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,519
showing you what it could really do if

611
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,519
you're messing with 500 total plants

612
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,879
it's like dating if you got seven dates

613
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,480
you're not going to know which girl was

614
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
into strawberry ice cream which girl was

615
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,519
into vanilla ice cream you're gonna have

616
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,359
to guess you're like oh [ __ ] you gotta

617
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,200
take notes you don't build any real

618
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,359
relationship if you focus on one plant

619
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,360
one person you'll learn all the details

620
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,279
all the anomalies all the ticks all the

621
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,199
things that makes that plant shine all

622
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,200
the things that make that plant angry

623
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,038
you'll learn that around week five if i

624
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,038
give it a nice boost of potassium it

625
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,960
really goes crazy you'll learn that if i

626
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,960
over give it too much calmag around week

627
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,038
seven it'll go [ __ ] crazy it will

628
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
start to learn all these nuances of the

629
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,240
plant if you develop a relationship with

630
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,558
one cut and run it multiple times over

631
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,960
and over again i know that doesn't sound

632
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,038
as exciting as running a bunch of seeds

633
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,519
but imagine what you can do once you get

634
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,919
one plant really dialed in the first

635
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,759
time you grow it it'll be good but we're

636
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,600
running 500 plants in the same

637
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,599
environment same conditions they don't

638
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,599
have a solid chance to show us what they

639
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,519
can really do we need to take a couple

640
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,038
of plants and learn them like i said a

641
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,879
moment ago maybe it wants something

642
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,279
special at week six maybe it doesn't

643
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,039
want something at week six maybe if you

644
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,240
make it colder a week seven it'll do

645
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:23,599
something maybe if you make it really

646
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,200
hot at week nine it does something

647
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,639
different we've got to learn these

648
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,798
things about the plants and the only way

649
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,038
we learn that is by growing them over

650
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,319
and over again and seeing how they react

651
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:33,679
to different

652
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,439
environments and different different

653
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
stressors different feedings different

654
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
things

655
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,159
i like to try little different things

656
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,679
every time i grow because i've got a

657
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
good grasp on growing i know what my

658
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
plants are going to do what if what if i

659
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
get it real real cold in here this

660
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,479
season what if i get it real real hot in

661
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
here this season what if i forget to

662
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,960
water the plants let's just see what

663
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,038
happens experiments that's where you

664
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
learn the most and then if you grow that

665
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,480
plant several times throughout the year

666
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,120
like i just said maybe it gets real hot

667
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,319
maybe it gets real cold i'm in colorado

668
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,519
this summer

669
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,839
it's going to hit like 112 115 degrees

670
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,000
in the winter it gets to negative 17

671
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,038
degrees i do my best to keep my grow

672
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
spaces dialed in and evened out but i'm

673
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,158
[ __ ] not there all the time [ __ ] goes

674
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,159
wrong sometimes it gets a little bit

675
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,000
cold in the grow rooms sometimes it gets

676
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,240
a little bit hotter in the grow rooms i

677
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,599
notice differences in the performance of

678
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,519
different plants based on these

679
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,359
anomalies in the grow room which i

680
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,000
failed to control because of my outside

681
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,918
environmental factors sometimes honestly

682
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,839
it's so cold outside i can't warm the

683
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,000
grow room to be 80 degrees i can only

684
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,678
get it to 70. sometimes it's so hot

685
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,159
outside i can't cool the grow room down

686
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,880
to 74. i can only get it to 80 because

687
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,640
it's so hot that's when i really do see

688
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,720
different expressions from some of these

689
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,720
plants also different light cycles

690
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,480
different feed cycles then different

691
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
defoliation methods maybe not

692
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
defoliating maybe do or maybe do not pop

693
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,159
it and twist it all these different

694
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,159
things do make a difference to the plant

695
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,600
so i love the idea that you want to run

696
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
through a bunch of [ __ ] and find all the

697
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,839
keepers but also maybe you're missing

698
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,000
something by going so quickly through so

699
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,678
many numbers and not spending time on

700
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
that one plant maybe that one right

701
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
there that you keep looking over because

702
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,558
you got 499 others maybe that one is the

703
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,880
next [ __ ] golden chem gorilla cookie

704
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,960
biscuit biscotti

705
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,039
what's the diesel kush i'm trying to

706
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,279
name all the popular [ __ ] but ah the

707
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,960
piff whatever else is popular cake stuff

708
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,798
maybe it's a new popular one and you

709
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,798
don't even know it because you haven't

710
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,960
taken the time to dial it in and perfect

711
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,960
it so dial in each cultivar before you

712
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,480
pass them on of course if that strain

713
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,240
sucks completely the first time you grow

714
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,000
it you could tell as an experienced

715
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,079
grower as a final hunter you could tell

716
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,599
when something straight up sucks but if

717
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,960
you think it's a seven on the first time

718
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,038
you run it and you're looking for nines

719
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
and tens give it another run maybe you

720
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,038
did something wrong you can bring out

721
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
the potential of that plant so what

722
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,119
would i do i would run a whole [ __ ]

723
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,439
bunch of plants or i would slow my ass

724
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,599
down and just run a few with the space

725
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
and resources i've got keep yourself

726
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:05,519
legal keep yourself safe keep yourself

727
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,440
