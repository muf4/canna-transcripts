for the question uh thank you for the

131
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,639
service now let me ramble a little bit

132
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,198
about uh so the question is uh it sounds

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,519
like you've got some plants they've been

134
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,840
pollinated and no you want to know how

135
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,399
far they need to go into that process

136
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,519
until those seeds are ready until you

137
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,879
can Harvest those seeds uh most of the

138
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,079
time after

139
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,399
pollination so this is after you know

140
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,038
the plants have been successfully

141
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,120
pollinated I pollinate twice I'll hit

142
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:16,120
them one time I'll let that boy uh

143
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,720
regenerate another batch of pollen then

144
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,639
I'll go in there and I'll hit them again

145
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,360
usually about 5 to seven days apart

146
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,560
maybe 10 days at the most I don't want

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
to go that far to be honest with you but

148
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,639
5 to seven days apart is ideal hit them

149
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,879
twice chop down the dude clean up the

150
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,680
pollen then let those plants start doing

151
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,319
their thing now uh the question the

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,759
answer to the question is generally from

153
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,039
that point about 6 to 8 weeks it depends

154
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,759
on several factors uh it could be 6 to n

155
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,959
weeks it just depends on how much light

156
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,400
is in the room what kind of light is in

157
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,159
the room how intense is the light how

158
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,159
many watts is it the appropriate

159
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,000
Spectrum how many hours is that light

160
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,400
running things like that definitely uh

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,639
contribute to the finishing time of your

162
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,439
seeds also uh humidity warmth cold swing

163
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,079
Wings overwater underwater all of those

164
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,918
things will contribute to the finishing

165
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,598
time of those seeds in what I would call

166
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,318
ideal conditions 6 to8 weeks and that is

167
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,319
going to be plant specific some of your

168
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,919
plants will spit them out in eight weeks

169
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,560
some are going to take nine weeks

170
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,959
because that is what that plant does you

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,918
won't be able to speed it up you can't

172
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,638
rush it there are tricks and tips you

173
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,318
can do like I said lighting and things

174
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,280
but that plant is just going to take

175
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,120
that long no matter what in some

176
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,918
phenotypes now I do have some tips here

177
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,598
uh you can get them to finish more quick

178
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,478
if you use a method that many people

179
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,120
that listen to my podcast or are at

180
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,120
least trolls on the Internet or have big

181
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,840
mouths on Twitter they think this idea

182
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,639
is crazy but anybody that's tried it has

183
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,000
sent me a message and said dude I tried

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
your uh the 186 method is what it's

185
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,079
called a lot of people know what I'm

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,960
leading to already people that are

187
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,639
afraid to try it think I'm a lunatic for

188
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,079
this they use a lot of creative words to

189
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,400
describe my idea here it's not my idea I

190
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,639
don't remember exactly where I learned

191
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,959
it it was a combination of things

192
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
falling into place now one practice I do

193
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,439
recommend heavily is after those plants

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,038
are pollinated what I like to do is I

195
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,000
turn my light timer back to 18 hours on

196
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,318
and 6 hours off I go to my regular

197
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,720
vegetative uh light cycle for those

198
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,120
plants after pollination has happened

199
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,240
many people's heads are blowing up

200
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,959
they're like why would you put your

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,000
flowering plants back into a veg cycle

202
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,839
because at this point I don't care about

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,519
buds I'm not growing for buds I don't

204
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,959
want flowers I don't care what they look

205
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,120
like at the end I am strictly growing

206
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,000
these plants for seed I focused on seed

207
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,598
production uh you're not going to get

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,399
any usable smokable flour out of this a

209
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,399
lot of people want to be able to grow a

210
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,959
plant that makes flowers to smoke and

211
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,198
seeds and when I'm doing it I focus on

212
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,079
one or the other I make a crop that is

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,240
going to be fully seeded because if I'm

214
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:51,038
making seeds I want every single every

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,360
single bat every single CX to be stuffed

216
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,680
with seeds in that entire plant I want

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
as many seeds as I can possibly get if

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
I'm going to smoke it I don't want any

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,919
seeds in there so it's one or the other

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,680
for me so if I'm doing this method I'm

221
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,439
doing it with a fully seated crop I'm

222
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,639
not con too concerned about the

223
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,158
appearance of this crop of the flowers

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,680
of the buds I don't care what it looks

225
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,879
like as long as those seeds are super

226
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,280
healthy that is all that matters to me

227
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,560
so when your head's blowing up saying

228
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,318
those plants are going to go back into

229
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,120
veg or weird stuff is going to happen

230
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,879
yes absolutely weird stuff is going to

231
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,158
happen uh after about 21 days the plants

232
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
will show signs of R about three weeks

233
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:28,240
into this uh you're going to be like

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,038
what is happening the plants are

235
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
spitting out little shoots starting to

236
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,879
put little plants coming off the top of

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,879
my regular plant what's going on it's

238
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,479
completely going into rev the leaves are

239
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,479
going to start twisting and doing weird

240
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,800
[ __ ] but guess what the seeds are going

241
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,680
to be very healthy very happy and very

242
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,319
viable and when you grow them you will

243
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,199
see that they're they are very

244
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,959
productive very happy seeds uh they will

245
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,720
make all of your grower friends very

246
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,838
happy if you sell them or share them

247
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,720
with them so what I do when I making

248
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,839
those seeds is I pollinate two times

249
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
then I turn that light back on to 186

250
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,040
and it speeds up that process this will

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,680
get those eight weers down to seven

252
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,838
weeks this will get the seven weers down

253
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,838
to six weeks the plants that take longer

254
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,720
to ripen the seeds will also take longer

255
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,240
in those expect that uh but uh not as

256
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,040
long as the plant will take to finish a

257
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,079
few weeks shorter but expect them to go

258
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,519
longer you can speed them up by doing

259
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,199
this 186 light manipulation method so

260
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,200
just a recap because we all know I like

261
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,920
to get rambly uh the quick answer to

262
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,480
this is most plants are going to take

263
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,120
you 6 to 8 weeks for those seeds to be

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,879
done maybe 9 we and some plants uh but

265
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,919
typically it's about 6 or eight weeks

266
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,838
until they're done after the pollination

267
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,199
of course and then uh the second part of

268
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,480
the question that I wanted to add to was

269
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,560
you can speed that process up by

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,278
changing that light cycle back to 18

271
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,518
hours on and 6 hours off again expect to

272
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,600
see Wild [ __ ] coming from those plants

273
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,078
but the seeds will be amazing all right

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,680
my dude weed vet I want to thank you

275

question is also about seeds and

286
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,240
breeding going to keep the theme moving

287
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,720
this one came from a friend who wants to

288

298
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,120
been having a lot of fun putting out the

299
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,759
podcast lately thank you for listening I

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,078
appreciate that uh the question says I

301
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,039
was hoping you could share a little more

302
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,359
information I'm starting to flower out

303
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,000
some plants and I'm only worried about

304
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,399
producing seeds with them so that will

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
make this easy it said my question is

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,559
when growing for seed making what

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,679
changes in your nutrition and light

308
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,879
cycle would you make if any uh thank you

309
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,319
much man stay well all right this is a

310
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,159
great question I do have fun with this

311
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,760
one the thing we're mostly going to do

312
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,719
if we're producing seeds and we're not

313
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,639
focused on uh flower production is I'm

314
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,079
going to drop out those Bloom boosters I

315
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,320
don't need the big heavy PK boosters at

316
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,799
the end of flower those aren't necessary

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,440
because I'm not uh boosting blooms I'm

318
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,479
just making seeds so we're going to drop

319
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,120
those out is going to be our first major

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,159
change we're going to feed the basic NPK

321
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,679
uh basically if you're a bottle-fed

322
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,838
nutrient grower person I don't switch

323
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,078
out uh so when you regularly go from Veg

324
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,079
to bloom you're going to switch to your

325
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,399
Bloom nutrient if you're making seeds

326
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,719
keep that veg nutrient going uh give it

327
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,519
that little bit of an increased nitrogen

328
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,560
uh lower volumes of potassium and

329
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,759
phosphorus uh that's just basically what

330
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,278
I've seen work well for the uh seed

331
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,278
production you don't need that Big Bloom

332
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,039
booster going on uh then a little a

333
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,838
little bit of extra uh calcium maybe a

334
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,838
touch extra of magnesium they come in

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,480
the same bottle everyone's going to say

336
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
just use the Cal Mag that's that will

337
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,800
work for you a little touch extra um and

338
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,000
then some silica I like to add a little

339
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,879
bit of silica a tip if you're mixing all

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,078
these nutrients in make sure silica

341
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,958
first um that's just a rule of thumb

342
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,519
when you're mixing silica products into

343
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,479
your uh solution mix the silica first

344
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,560
get it thoroughly emulsify then add your

345
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,759
other products in I would go the silica

346
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,119
your base nutrient the CAG

347
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,919
and then after that I would add some

348
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,440
amino acids is another thing I would add

349
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,679
you can add carbs in there if you'd like

350
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,199
but amino acids is another thing that I

351
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,719
would definitely add to that micro

352
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,958
Hydroponics makes a great Amino booster

353
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,800
product it is cost effective you need

354
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,159
very minimal of that to make healthy

355
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,399
seeds I would add that to your mix amino

356
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,078
acids are the building blocks of life it

357
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,480
makes sense to me to add a little bit of

358
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,319
aminos to my feed for my seeds it makes

359
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,680
sense to me so that's mainly what I

360
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,839
would recommend and then um for light

361
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,120
once again I would talk about that 186

362
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,639
light light cycle some people will tell

363
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
you to leave in the uh if you do switch

364
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,600
out the HPS for the metalight if you're

365
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
old school uh some people may tell you

366
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,399
to leave that metal highight in there uh

367
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,078
throughout the veg process right into

368
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,198
flour but uh my main nutrition

369
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
difference is going to be I'm going to

370
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,439
cut out those Bloom boosters I recommend

371
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,440
usually um some boosters I'm not going

372
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,519
to say them because I don't want to

373
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,880
confuse your head cut those out we don't

374
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,399
need those uh we need so another thing I

375
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,198
also want to recommend is the entire

376
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,559
room needs to be in line you need a

377
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,399
solid VPD um if your plant does get

378
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,958
powdery mildew the powdery mildew will

379
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,078
attack the seeds the seeds will have

380
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,919
powdery mildew on them uh that doesn't

381
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,719
mean they will grow powdery mildew that

382
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,719
is not what that means at all but if an

383
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,120
educated consumer buys your seeds and

384
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,600
puts them under a microscope a

385
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,639
magnifying glass they can identify the

386
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,800
presence of pathogens that were on that

387
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,639
seed as it was shipped uh there can be

388
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,799
fungus on the seed when it arrives to

389
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,039
your customer if you got Bud rot if you

390
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,159
got powdery mildew uh make sure not to

391
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,000
do that let's get that room dialed in

392
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,319
get the whole room in line you need

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,440
everything beautiful not just uh not

394
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
just the nutrition you need uh subcool

395
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,240
used to call it the laws the lights the

396
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,959
air the water and the soil all of that

397
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,198
needs to be dialed in and when you're

398
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,078
making seeds it's very nice to get all

399
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,479
of that extra dialed in to get those

400
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,559
seeds extra perfect uh to get the plants

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,440
extra healthy that way you can get as

402
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,599
many uh as many pistols as possible on

403
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,560
each plant and then make as many seeds

404
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
as possible to start with and then just

405
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,559
keep those plants thoroughly healthy all

406
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,919
the way then you have healthy happy big

407
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,159
fat robust round seeds all right let me

408
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,159
make sure I've answered this question

409
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,600
because I'm super rambly today which is

410
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,679
not a problem for a podcaster uh what

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,360
changes to nutrition uh drop out the

412
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,758
bloom boosters keep that uh the base

413
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,480
nutrients coming all the way through uh

414
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,079
you don't have to flush because you are

415
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,278
feeding seeds uh no one's going to smoke

416
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,519
this and I think flushing is partly

417
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,480
mostly a myth anyway uh flushing is a

418
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,039
myth I'm standing to buy it um increase

419
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,839
your Cal Mag feed them some silica and

420
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,519
of course feed them those amino acids

421
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,440
and if you want to get frisky give them

422
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
some carbs and always nobody pays me to

423
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,600
say this but give them some microbes big

424
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,519
shout out to my buddy Scotty reel get

thank you for the podcast and thanks for

478
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,360
the inspiration to LEAP into making my

479
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
own seeds my dude uh thank you for

480
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,318
listening to the show and thank you for

481
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,480
considering me an inspiration I've been

482
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,480
called a lot of words a lot of names and

483
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,360
an inspiration is when I'd like to be

484
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,720
called again thank you my bro the

485
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,959
question said my question is this uh

486
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,519
when pollinating a receiver plant makes

487
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,798
sense so far is it possible to pollinate

488
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,759
two different branches with different

489
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:45,359
pollen and make multiple crosses from

490
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:48,919
one female plant it is possible but I

491
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:52,719
don't recommend it you can do it but I'm

492
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,799
a stickler I like Purity I like um I

493
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,400
like knowing a lot of where uh pedigree

494
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,119
is what I really like to know I want to

495
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,240
make sure that the seeds that came from

496
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,639
this Branch definitely are what I think

497
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,120
they are and I'm hypercritical about

498
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
that if you're not 1,000% stressed about

499
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,479
it if you don't care that maybe the

500
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,798
pollen from this pollination got over to

501
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,519
this one and and vice versa go for it

502
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,079
but I don't want that to happen I sell

503
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,200
seeds I need people to be able to rely

504
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,639
on this is what I said it is if you're

505
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,960
going to grow it yourself and have fun

506
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,080
with it uh get down to it bro do make

507
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
the [ __ ] happen have a good old time

508
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,678
but if those seeds are going any I don't

509
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,798
recommend it because you could you could

510
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,320
simply cross-pollinate which isn't a

511
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,558
thing that I normally say that's a silly

512
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,240
word to me but that's what you could

513
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,079
accidentally do cross-contaminate your

514
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,079
two pollinations and you could get

515
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,480
because pollen is microscopic pollen is

516
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,359
Tiny and it just takes one strong breath

517
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,079
and you can move that pollen

518
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,879
accidentally around so I wouldn't do it

519
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,759
the could you yes would I know that's

520
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,960
that's the quick version of that answer

521
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,119
but um could you is it possible yeah yes

522
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,679
it's possible to uh pollinate different

523
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,918
branches with different pollen to make

524
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,919
different crosses from one plant it

525
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,720
absolutely is but it's risky and I would

526
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
not do it but like I said if you're a

527
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,240
home breeder if you're a dude having fun

528
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,759
uh that sounds like fun to me I can't do

529
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,880
it in my position CU I really I want to

530
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:22,038
know the pedigree of everything in my

531
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,720
garden to a really um an OCD type of

532
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:24,960
level there is more to this I'm not

533
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,519
going to shoot you down completely and

534
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,960
in the question though it says also when

535
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,879
growing plants for seed is the drying

536
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,519
the same as for smoke or should it be

537
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,840
drier than normal thank you for the time

538
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,519
I took a dab and I gave my mom a hug bro

539
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,918
thank you for the dab and the hug I

540
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,558
appreciate that uh she mumbled something

541
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,679
about orange gasm oh I'm not going to

542
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,599
read the rest of that um that's that's

543
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,840
that that's cringey bro I like it um I'm

544
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:54,399
just not going to read the rest of it so

545
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,639
I only recommend one male is what I

546
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,840
wrote on as my notes Here pollen moves

547
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
easily you could breathe pollen into the

548
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,678
wrong part but like I said if you're

549
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
having fun get down to it bro Jungle

550
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,919
Boogie now let's talk about this other

551
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,840
part how dry should I let these plants

552
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,080
get what I do we're just going to talk

553
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,480
briefly about how I harvest seeded

554
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,960
plants because that's the only way to

555
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,120
get this right uh what I normally do is

556
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,038
I take the plant and I chop the plant

557
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,678
down I take the plant tag and make sure

558
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,038
it is now attached to that dried plant

559
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,759
in a or in that harvested plant in a way

560
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,319
that it will not come off that plant tag

561
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,798
is moving with that plant now for the

562
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,319
rest of its life it ends up in the bin

563
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,000
with the seeds that helps me verify it

564
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,079
just keeps it stays all the way through

565
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,200
so I chop down the Plant I take the

566
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,038
plant tag it goes with it it hangs over

567
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,960
a tupperware bin might be a sterlite bin

568
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,440
I don't remember the name it's sterlite

569
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
it's a short one it would normally go

570
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,240
under your bed for clothing is what I

571
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,880
think they sell it for but it's just the

572
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,880
right size for a harvested plant so I

573
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,720
hang the plant right above that I hang

574
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,280
it above that in case I leave it too

575
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,240
long and it starts to dry and the seeds

576
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,798
do fall out then it falls into my

577
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,720
Collective bin right underneath it it

578
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,158
most of the time they don't get that far

579
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
but I do let them get what I would

580
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,799
consider the unit of measurement for how

581
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,399
dry they are would be dry as [ __ ] that

582
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,480
is the unit of measurement which I let

583
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
them get to they'll be they will be dry

584
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,480
as [ __ ] then I will take a pair of

585
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,918
gloves and I will grab one the plant by

586
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,319
the stock and I will hang it over that

587
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,919
uh Bin and I will pull all of the buds

588
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,079
right off of that stock just like this

589
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,720
and it's so dry that it just sounds like

590
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,918
it's raining seeds right into my

591
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,839
collector bin and then with those same

592
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,640
gloves I will take my hands and just

593
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,879
mush that butt up into little tiny dust

594
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,880
basically and then now I've got dust of

595
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,240
green dust with a bunch of seeds in

596
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,640
there now the fun part after that is

597
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,120
sifting that green part the chaff is

598
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,480
what that is called from the seeds

599
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,000
that's what that is uh you want you got

600
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,919
to get all the chaff out of the seed or

601
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,159
the seed out of the chaff depends on

602
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,038
what you got more of is how I guess

603
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,440
you're going to refer to it but that is

604
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,319
the fun part I've got a machine that

605
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
helps me do it uh there are a lot of

606
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,319
different creative machines available

607
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,639
but uh you're asking about how dry I let

608
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,678
it get dry as [ __ ] my dude uh just let

609
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,960
it get crispy dry and the seeds will

610
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,720
probably start plopping out and that's

611
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
when you want to grab it and just chuck

612
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,000
all those buds shuck all the buds right

613
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,839
off the stick into a bin and then I just

614
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,759
give it the old dusty [ __ ] hand

615
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,079
treatment just grind it up all your

616
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,079
material is going to fall right into

617
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,879
that bin you could tip it one way and

618
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,240
most of the seeds will roll down but

619
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,440
there are a lot of different methods to

620
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,839
get the chaff separated from there many

621
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,200
of them involve using uh either a light

622
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,278
fan or a vacuum if you can put a vacuum

623
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,880
on low and learn how to feather it

624
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,240
brother just to get uh just get the the

625
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,760
weed out and not the seeds you'll figure

626
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,319
out how to do it you'll suck up a few

627
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,440
seeds in the beginning but uh if it's

628
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,000
yours it's okay just don't go ham and

629
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,278
[ __ ] suck that whole batch of seeds

630
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,679
up don't do it just skip this idea um

631
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,798
I've seen it done I know how to do it

632
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm not going to teach you how to do it

633
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:50,679
and suck up a whole batch of seeds in

634
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,839
the vacuum because you'll be mad as [ __ ]

635
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,240
at me bro here comes the hate mail

636
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,879
roster Jeff I'm digging through my

637
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,278
vacuum for my f1s no thank you don't

638
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,200
want to hear it but if you learn how to

639
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,880
do it you could gently feather a vacuum

640
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,038
over your batch of seeds and suck up all

641
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,840
the chaff and not get the weed or the

642
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,839
seeds that you want all right where are

643
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,158
we what am I even talking about at this

644
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,119
point let's not make it a morovich

645
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,520
situation unless you really wanted to

646
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,158
get it dry as [ __ ] and find a process

647
