00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,739
day I apologize that stitcher failed to

40
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,960
grab that I did repost it as soon as I

41
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,579
was notified I shot it to my friend that

42
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,959

know that stitcher did not pick up the

48
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,129
episode what happens you guys I put the

49
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,140
episode up to my website and then

50
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,759
stitcher and iTunes and all the other

51
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,650
services grab it and they post it for

52
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,329
some reason stitcher has been missing

53
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,740
all of my episodes they don't grab it

54
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,500
appropriately I have to go back and

55
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,819
repost it specifically for stitcher not

56
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,409
sure what's going on I've emailed them a

57
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,569
couple of times they take forever to

58
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,280
respond by the time they respond I've

59
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,500
already corrected the issue myself I

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,900
will keep an eye on it and I will keep

61
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,610
the the episodes coming and keep it

62
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,989
issue free on stitcher for you guys

63
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,440
thank you for everybody that listens on

64
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,599
stitcher I do appreciate it one thing

65
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,159
that sucks about stitcher there's not a

66
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,329
lot of good ways for you to leave

67
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,579
comments you can leave them on the

68
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,960
episode you can leave them on the pay

69
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,030
but it's hard for me to find it I have

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,030
to go search each episode nothing

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,460
notifies me that I've got any review or

72
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,539
a comment there on stitcher so it's hard

73
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,400
to find them but I appreciate your

74
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,109
comments and reviews leave them I look

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,879

76
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,240
reviews I want to start the podcast by

77
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,460
reading the most recent iTunes reviews

78
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,840
let me turn down the music and get right

79

00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,259
me consent written permission and I

167
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,968

168
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,620
alright those are the two most recent

169
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:55,959
iTunes comments I appreciate you guys

170
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,680
for leaving them let's move forward with

171
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,658
the podcast last week I teased that I

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,819
would be reading emails from a couple of

173
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:05,528
listeners from down south so I've got

174
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,419
those emails in front of me I'm just

175
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:10,000
picking randomly which one goes first

176
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:12,310
this one's on top this email I'm looking

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,259
to see if they use a name ah nope they

178
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,939
don't use a name so it goes like this hi

179
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,560
my new friend I live in Georgia my wife

180
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,750
and I are planning to move to a greener

181
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,180
state next May or June

182
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,889
most likely Colorado I have some family

183
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,228
in the springs and I have lived there

184
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,870
before Colorado Springs is about 45

185
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:32,228
minutes north of me it is a military

186
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,680
town it's not a bad place they are one

187
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:38,740
of the few towns or cities with actual

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,810
smoke clubs that's where the canna

189
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,788
Canyon is that's where the dab lounge is

190
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,459
it's where a lot of these smoke places

191
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:47,620
are so Colorado Springs is not a bad

192
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,870
place this person that goes on to say I

193
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,240
want to get into the industry growing

194
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,590
eventually I currently have little to no

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,449
experience I

196
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:58,359
have kids so an illegal grow is not an

197
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,430
option I have sis I have inspected and

198
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,680
consulted a few local growers with basic

199
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,689
problems but I like an experience I make

200
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,879
up for in knowledge and research skills

201
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,589
I'm trying to be as proactive as

202
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,569
possible without getting any charges

203
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,889
that's very smart of you especially

204
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,089
since you said you've got children in

205
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,099
here so that's a cool way to do it

206
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:16,419
you're going to other folks as Gardens

207
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,250
and learning in there then you can leave

208
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,259
and not be part of anything that goes

209
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,459
wrong should anything go wrong pretty

210
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:26,289
smooth move ah then you go on to say I

211
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,000
read listen learn I have no college but

212
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,640
I feel like all information is locked up

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,040
in books not buildings my question is

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,139
what advice would you give an uneducated

215
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,879
family man with nothing more than a deep

216
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,310
passion for marijuana and a lot of

217
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,949
determination that wants to get in to

218
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,110
the industry then you ask a couple more

219
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,849
questions but we're off to a great start

220
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,770
the first thing that you're gonna have

221
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,670
to think about um can you get your badge

222
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,409
everybody that works in the state of

223
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,600
Colorado marijuana industry the

224
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,810
regulated industry it's a marijuana

225
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,490
enforcement regulated industry everybody

226
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,370
that works there has to undergo a

227
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,620
thorough background check if you want to

228
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,079
there are three levels of badges there

229
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,850
are support badges there's a key badge

230
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,800
and there is an owner badge each badge

231
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,689
cost more money to get an owner badge

232
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,340
you actually have to be a license holder

233
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,290
you have to own the license of the

234
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,569
business to get a key badge

235
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,610
a key badges for somebody I've got a key

236
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,829
badge a key is for somebody who has got

237
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,830
keys somebody who would make decisions

238
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:30,099
there has to be a keyhole a key badge

239
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:31,810
person on premises at all times if there

240
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,250
are other people in the building if

241
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,470
you've got somebody with a support badge

242
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,169
there has to be a key badge in the

243
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,720
building around them at all times so a

244
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,519
key badge is ideal if you're going to

245
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,360
move into the industry and plan on

246
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,100
having any sort of AA management

247
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,379
position or any sort of authority within

248
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,149
the CRO you're going to want to get the

249
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,279
key badge the support badge is how you

250
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,990
get your foot in the door the trimmers

251
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,819
are only required to have a support

252
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,370
badge blood tenders are only required to

253
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,830
have a support badge but you were

254
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,690
limited on tasks and duties and jobs you

255
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,150
can perform which means you are limited

256
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,860
on income you can receive

257
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,600
of course as you move up in the cannabis

258
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,379
industry you're paying creases

259
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,870
drastically from a trimmer to a grow

260
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,970
tech to the lead cultivator to the

261
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,960
consultants to whoever else you've

262
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,100
gotten the building there are a lot of

263
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
people that you guys there are lawyers

264
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,600
there are consultants there packagers

265
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,310
there are advertising people there are

266
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,659
accountants there's payroll there are a

267
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:30,639
lot of people in different departments

268
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,589
but as you move up you certainly do make

269
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,569
more money so the support badge is a

270
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,670
good start the key badge is where you

271
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,000
want to be so the first thing you need

272
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:42,219
to do Google how do I get my Colorado

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,649
marijuana Enforcement Division support

274
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,990
badge or a key badge google it it will

275
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,389
take you to I think it's the marijuana

276
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,669
Enforcement Division website there will

277
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,069
be a page in there with about 10

278
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,169
questions and it says if you say yes to

279
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,810
any of these questions you are not able

280
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:00,789
to get a badge I do not remember the

281
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,549
technical parts off the top of my head

282
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:05,980
if you've got drug felonies within like

283
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:09,669
5 or 10 years I think that excludes you

284
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,500
if you've got felonies within the last 5

285
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,120
years of some sort that excludes you

286
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,279
there are just certain things that will

287
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,049
exclude you you need to have your

288
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,389
student loans they don't need to be paid

289
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,879
off you need to be showing progress that

290
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,740
you're paying them I pay child support I

291
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,360
had to show that my child support is

292
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,669
current and that I'm not [ __ ] up my

293
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,019
child support and once I provided a copy

294
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,339
of that like oh yeah all your stuffs

295
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,169
current and here you go here's your your

296
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,639
badge I got my badge because my

297
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:36,490
appointment was at 10:00 in the morning

298
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,379
and I had my badge by 5 o'clock that day

299
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,759
it was finished if I wanted to stay in

300
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,110
Colorado Springs I could have picked it

301
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,519
up I had the mail it to me because I

302
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,779
didn't want to stick around in Springs I

303
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,909
didn't have anything to do I drove home

304
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,159
and just had to mail it but they got it

305
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:50,529

306
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,449
by 5:00 and ready for me to pick up so

307
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,759
that's how long it took for me to get my

308
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,100
badge it's not that hard if you've got

309
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,750
stuff on your record you may have to

310
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,279
bring paperwork you may have to show

311
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,350
that all of your court records that all

312
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,699
of your obligations for court have been

313
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,129
completed if you were required to do

314
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,290
classes or pay fines or do whatever you

315
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,210
need to show that that's been done if

316
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,980
you've got any sort of court cases all

317
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,230
of it needs to be tied up or shown that

318
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,149
you're handling it responsibly so first

319
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,190
thing I would do before uh the next line

320
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,230
and the email is what can I do until we

321
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,950

322
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,720

323

eligible to get a badge if you've never

324
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,899
been in trouble before you're just fine

325
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,310
if you don't have any outstanding debts

326
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,919
any student loans anything like that

327
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:32,019

328
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,299
fine if you've got some fuck-ups in your

329
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,699
in your past you may need to check out

330
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,589
what you need to do to correct that so

331
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,750
that you can get the badge the next

332
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,060
thing you can do until you move it seems

333
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,070
to be like you're on the right path

334
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:47,289
read read a lot of books about growing

335
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,629
cannabis read the most up-to-date books

336
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,799
about growing cannabis whenever a new

337
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:53,230
book comes out about growing cannabis

338
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,629
read it go back and read all the old

339
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,330
books about growing cannabis read all of

340
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,909
Jorge Cervantes grow Bibles read all the

341
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,470
Ed Rosenthal books read all of the Greg

342
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:04,240
Greene books there are so many authors

343
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,310
in my head that won't come out right now

344
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,659
because I'm trying to say them as soon

345
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,699
as I quit thinking about authors they'll

346
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:12,399
all come to my head I would for sure

347
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,770
recommend DJ shorts new book DJ short

348
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,329
just recently put out another book one

349
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:18,429
thing I would recommend I said Greg

350
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,110
Green a moment ago I would recommend I'm

351
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:22,120
pretty sure Greg green wrote the

352
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,519
cannabis grow bible he also wrote the

353
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,789
cannabis breeders Bible I would heavily

354
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,220
recommend those books also I would

355
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:32,110
recommend podcasts not just mine I would

356
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,720
recommend a lot of cannabis podcasts

357
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,159
there was a show called free weed free

358
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,340
weed is part of what inspired this

359
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,809
podcast free weed was a pretty good show

360
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,090
there was some great info to come out of

361
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,709
that podcast the thing I didn't like was

362
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,720
if you asked a grow question if you said

363
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,250
hey I've got spider mites the host of

364
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,660
the show wouldn't teach you about mites

365
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,759
he wouldn't do much about it he would

366
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,559
say we'll go buy this product and spray

367
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,210
it which yeah that's cool but all that

368
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,769
does is make money for that company and

369
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,600
then later on on the show he would say

370
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,429
also this podcast is sponsored by the

371
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,870
company I told you to buy the product of

372
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:04,419
earlier and I felt it was a little

373
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,340
shifty nobody pays me to tell you to use

374
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,289
a product I don't use a product because

375
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,180
somebody pays for it I use a product

376
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:13,959
because it works and then I like to

377
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:15,339
teach you guys about why you're getting

378
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,509
that problem like if you've got spider

379
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,399
mites I try to tell you where they came

380
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,929
from how to fix it what the problem is

381
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,490
what to look for I don't just say go buy

382
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,759
some [ __ ] and spray it I kind of try to

383
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,470
teach you a long-term prevention that

384
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,029
other podcast was just like go buy some

385
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,110
[ __ ] because I'll get a kickback for it

386
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:31,389
and I didn't think that was cool but

387
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,159
listen to that podcast free weed there

388
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,000
will be some nuggets in there they have

389
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,219
some

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,200
panels from the High Times Cannabis Cup

391
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,149
the feature great growers and great

392
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,590
breeders and those shows will be the

393
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,500
most informative that will give you the

394
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,620
most usable knowledge other than free

395
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,250
weed I would recommend the spliff SPL

396
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,090
iff the spliff podcast hosted by Miss

397
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,559
bone Ellis

398
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,090
she's taking a little break right now

399
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,789
which gives you plenty of time to catch

400
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,040
up on all of her episodes she will teach

401
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:02,169
you a lot of things that you may not

402
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,759
even think about wanting to learn she

403
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:06,069
opens up my eyes to new ideas on

404
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,049
cannabis and cannabis usage all of the

405
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,640
time you don't only want to learn about

406
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:11,709
growing you want to learn about the

407
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,259
other end about the use the medical

408
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,879
effects you want to learn about Terps

409
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,429
learn about all of that stuff bo will

410
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,730
teach you that the dude grows podcast is

411
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:23,919
a great podcast also there's a podcast

412
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,100
called the Adam Dunn show if you are

413
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,349
looking for really long podcast the Adam

414
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,019
Dunn show can be three hours long

415
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,490
without any trouble I personally haven't

416
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,899
listened to the Adam Dunn show in quite

417
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,549
a while because it's such a long show

418
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,829
and I've got so many podcasts to listen

419
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:40,870
to and it kind of I noticed if I listen

420
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,490
to too many weed podcasts it affects my

421
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,730
show and it affects my voice in my

422
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,320
podcasting style and I don't want to rip

423
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,000
off anybody's show so I kind of put up

424
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,470
blinders and ignore their shows and

425
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,870
listen to bone ellas because we're on a

426
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,149
totally different path of podcast ideas

427
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,370
she talks more about the consumption and

428
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,439
the that part of it and I talked more

429
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,299
about the production so I don't feel

430
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,630
that her show contaminates my mind very

431
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,609
much but I feel like free weed and the

432
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,529
dude grow show and the Adam Dunn show

433
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,120
can kind of contaminate me it's like if

434
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,919
I were a comedian I wouldn't listen to a

435
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,089
lot of other comedians too often because

436
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,129
I wouldn't want to start sounding like

437
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,020
them like if I did comedy right now I

438
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:19,539
would just sound like Joey Diaz and

439
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,559
[ __ ] all those people it's like music

440
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,730
you just start saying I don't want to do

441
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,019
that to my podcast anyway let me get

442
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,870
back on track with the [ __ ] I was saying

443
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,819
that Adam Dunn show I think it's hosted

444
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,669
by Adam Dunn from th seeds of course I

445
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,400
think the co-host when I last listened

446
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:35,829
was Mitch Inasa who has worked with a

447
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,620
lot of big names in the industry he's a

448
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,570
very well-respected guy I respect him I

449
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,089
appreciate his work Mitch brings a lot

450
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,760
to the table for podcasting he writes

451
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,370
great papers he speaks well he's got

452
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,080
great presentation

453
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,269
stays on top of the cannabis industry so

454
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,310
he's well informed of what's going on in

455
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,528
the industry and socially and culturally

456
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,338
within cannabis and he's also just a

457
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:58,259
great dude

458
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,470
so it's good to have Mitch on a podcast

459
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,629
and also sometimes mr. Michael Holly

460
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,240
also known as bike is on the podcast and

461
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,610
then they have some amazing guests being

462
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,500
up there in Denver right in the heart of

463
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,509
Denver when events come through

464
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,190
everybody goes and stops at the Adam

465
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:16,588
Dunn show they've had chem dog on there

466
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,390
that was one of my favorite episodes the

467
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,000
dudes from Dark Horse have been on there

468
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,860
a lot of Miele has been on there if you

469
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,500
know anything about Miele Jensen DJ Nick

470
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,629
attea has been on there Tim Martin drops

471
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,669
in occasionally so the Adam Dunn shows a

472
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:33,240
great podcast I would say listen to all

473
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,250
these cannabis podcasts also I would say

474
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,450
scour the internet forums for

475
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,339
information but be very careful what you

476
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,680
believe there will be a lot of [ __ ]

477
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,700
on there let the forum's spark your mind

478
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,679
and then search whatever you read do the

479
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,140
research and see what you can learn from

480
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,939
that because I will see [ __ ] in a forum

481
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,220
and I'll say this is such a cool idea

482
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,020
then I'll go wait some dude on the

483
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,399
internet wrote this who knows who wrote

484
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,559
this it could be a nine-year-old little

485
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,958
kid it could be a 50 year old guy it

486
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,849
could be anybody it could be all made up

487
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,009
you never know so every time I read

488
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,448
something I want to go google what

489
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,129
they're saying from seven other

490
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,350
directions and see how this works why it

491
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,559
works if it works what could go wrong

492
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,818
just go scour the forums get some ideas

493
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,389
and then just start reading on your own

494
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,338
and figuring it out from there also what

495
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,870
can you do before you move keep doing

496
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:27,178
those consultations if somebody else

497
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:29,519
around you is growing go check out those

498
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,210
grows just be around as many grows as

499
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,650
you can also be around plants they don't

500
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,000
have to be cannabis plants if you're

501
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,410
working with plants you're learning

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,150
about transplanting you're learning

503
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,700
about watering you can tell how much

504
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,259
water a plant will need be in a

505
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,660
greenhouse if you can be in a greenhouse

506
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:49,220
or wherever be around plants working

507
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,840
with plants most of what we do in a

508
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,569
marijuana grow in a cannabis cultivation

509
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,609
facility is basic horticulture things

510
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:58,079
that would happen in other plant

511
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,789
production facilities if you're

512
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,490
producing tomato plants or tulips or

513
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,349
whatever

514
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,529
a lot of it is the same [ __ ] something

515
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:07,359
else he could do learn about insects and

516
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:09,460
insect control a lot of people don't

517
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,699
know enough about how to take care of

518
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,980
insects one thing you can do go to the

519
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,529
Colorado does Google allowable

520
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,240
pesticides in Colorado marijuana and it

521
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,220
will be the Department of Ag as the

522
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,779
website you want to find Department of

523
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,250
Ag will have a list the Colorado

524
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,139
Department of Agriculture will have a

525
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,109
list of products who are allowed to use

526
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,340
in marijuana Enforcement Division

527
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,990
regulated grows learn those products

528
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,730
think about which insects are going to

529
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,470
infest the crops that you plan on

530
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,079
working in those are spider mites thrips

531
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,210
white flies fungus gnats powdery mildew

532
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,279
is always an issue those are basically

533
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,569
the things you're gonna run into think

534
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,970
about all the basic bugs you're gonna

535
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:52,178
get in a grow indoors then learn how to

536
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,190
combat those pests with the things that

537
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,080
are allowed on that list and get good

538
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,390
strategies because not enough people

539
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,529
have strategies for that so if you come

540

546
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,980
do once we move once you move here get

547
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,589
set up before you move move to an area

this may sound like a no-brainer but

566
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,100
I've seen people post things on social

567
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,408
media that let me know that I need to

568

facility at risk you cannot bring

576
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:24,168
product your own personal product into a

577
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,409
facility that is highly illegal do not

578
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:29,210
do that also as as the lead cultivator

579
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,980
of a facility if I'm hiring you as a

580
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,960
grow tech to be my backup guy I don't

581
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,819
want to see the product you grow that's

582
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,350
not gonna matter too much I've got that

583
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,878
part under control what I want is

584
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,199
somebody that can show up on time

585
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:42,288
somebody with a solid work ethic

586
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,359
somebody that is willing to learn one

587
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:46,069
thing if you know too much about growing

588
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:48,408
and you're trying to work at the

589
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:50,269
facility that I run chances are I may

590
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,470
not hire you because I'm concerned that

591
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,569
you're going to come in and try to

592
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,909
reinvent my wheel we've got a very good

593
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:57,349
system at Three Rivers myself and a

594
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,359
couple other people have devised a

595
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:02,028
really good system from clone to harvest

596
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:04,308
it works very well there's a lot of

597
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:06,288
money invested in the rooms and the

598
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:08,388
systems and the procedure we can't

599
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:09,919
change that because the new guy thinks

600
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:11,148
he knows how to grow weed better than me

601
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,899
and all the people that have been there

602
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:16,459
and designed the whole pattern so we

603
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,898
need people that are moldable people

604
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,489
that are willing to learn people that

605
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:21,498
are willing to listen people that are

606
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,569
willing to take command from somebody

607
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:25,669
who may be younger than them I see that

608
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:27,019
to be a problem in some facilities I had

609
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:28,549
a boss who was younger than me

610
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,749
and he had a hard time telling me what

611
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:31,940
to do and I'd be like bro you're the

612
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,409
boss tell me what needs to be done I can

613
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,778
do it some people don't like taking

614
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:39,259
orders essentially from someone younger

615
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:41,599
than them be just be receptive be open

616
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,720
and be willing to start as a trimmer you

617
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,459
want to be a lead grower 90% of the

618
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,710
people that start off in the Colorado

619
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,778
marijuana industry start off as either a

620
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,340
budtender or a trimmer that's your way

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,889

624
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:00,230
applications taller than my water bottle

625
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,028
and I just go through them and I throw

626
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,259
half of them away nope not qualified no

627
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:04,128
they wrote something stupid in their

628
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,220
application nope

629
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:09,408

that may benefit my cause not that I'm

643
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,390
aware of there is a bud tending school

644
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,759
here in Colorado I don't think most

645
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,920
employers care too much about it you'll

646
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,650
have to understand a system called

647
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,000
metric ami TRC I don't unders I don't

648
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,600
remember what it means marijuana

649
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,519
something something tracking something

650
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,109
you'll have to learn that so be able to

651
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,970
use computers put on your resume that

652

you understand how to use computers a

653
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:01,850

698
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,440
application call call back and bother

699
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:35,959
them and see if they've seen your

700
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,910
application or resume or drop in go in

701
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,500
there and check when you go in

702
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,779
here's advice when you go in to check on

703
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,539
your application don't shop also make it

704
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,700
a separate visit go in there and buy

705
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,589
product or go in there and check on your

706
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,759
application don't do both because then

707
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,839
it looks like you just dropped in to buy

708
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,029
weed and you thought while you're here

709
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,909
you would check do those on separate

710
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:58,129
trips all right so go in there and be

711
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,720
aggressive call back let them know you

712
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,520
want the job because we've got so many

713
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,410
applications that we you might want to

714
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,029
remind us that yours is in the pile so

715
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,160
just call back bother them let them know

716
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:09,769

717
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,690

720
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:16,700
some of them can be on time someone that

721
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,350
is honest someone that can take

722
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,539

cannabis in our state however I am NOT

795
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,029
optimistic the way things have been

796
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,159
going yeah it doesn't look well for

797

Florida right now but eventually every

00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:07,490
goes on to say it's completely changed

807
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,470
my outlook on the way that cannabis is

808
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,480
handled today in our society after

809
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,009
everything that has happened it is only

810
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,660
strengthened my resolve to become a

811
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:16,490
breeder in order to help others get the

812
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,610
specialized medicine that they so

813
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,049
desperately need no it's terrible that

814
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,849
it took something like that to make you

815
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,980
change your outlook but I'm glad you're

816
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:26,779
on Team cannabis now and I'm proud of

817
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,579
you for wanting to be a breeder for such

818
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,950
a good reason there's a lot of people

819
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:33,529
breeding for the wrong reasons and for

820
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,360
selfish and personal reasons and it's

821
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,220
good to see more people growing from

822
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,869
their heart breeding with love even if

823
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,920
you're not there yet you've got the

824
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:41,779
right thing in your heart and that's

825
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,390
what we all need so you're going the

826
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,849
right direction I goes on to say with

827
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,080
that being said my question is this how

828
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:51,019
would you recommend getting into the

829
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,869
industry in new emerging States or estab

830
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:57,408
especially with former agriculture and

831
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:59,509
secondary education now in the last

832
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,309
email I read I talked about getting a

833
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,859
badge if you're not able to get a badge

834
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:05,569
you can still be I think you can still

835
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,459
be the accountant because you would be

836
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:09,619
an outside contractor you would not

837
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,230
actually work for the dispensary you

838
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:14,000
would be silver gooch personal

839
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,200
accounting or silver Gooch business

840
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,269
accounting whatever you called it and

841
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,710
then you would be hired it would just be

842
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:20,119
a service and be like going to Walmart

843
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,140
Walmart doesn't need a badge and I can

844
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:23,119
go there and buy supplies

845
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,130
I think I'm not certain that that's how

846
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,898
it works but that may be the loophole

847
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,340
perhaps if you're not able to get a

848
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,389
badge I don't know anything about you

849
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,759
but I'm just saying since you've got

850
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,278
that college experience there that may

851
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,230
be another way in for you your question

852
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:38,599
is how do you get in the same way that

853
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,069
I'm recommended in the other email take

854
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,798
the steps see if you can get a badge

855
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:46,038
then move to an area that Scott grows in

856
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,690
your area then apply heavily and then go

857
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:50,000
and make sure those people have seen

858
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,558
your application with all of that green

859
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,148
house experience I'm sure you've applied

860
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:54,619
pesticides I'm sure you know how to

861
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:56,658
water plants you probably know how to

862
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:59,509
take clones make sure you put that on

863
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:02,539
your resume and list everything you've

864
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:04,788
ever done especially stuff like if your

865
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:07,298
pesticide application certified in your

866
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:10,308
state write that down if you've got any

867
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:11,990
certifications any trainings even if

868
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,398
it's like an OSHA training everybody in

869
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,470
my growers worker protection safety

870
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:18,500
train which is a pesticide training that

871
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,329
looks really good on a resume I know how

872
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,909
to program the Gavita master controller

873
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:25,428
that is just one sends that adds to my

874
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:28,340
resume I am well versed in the eye

875
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:30,409
ponics the link for system controllers

876
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:32,418
that looks good on a resume any of the

877
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:33,710
program or any of the equipment or

878
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,820
training programs that you have taken

879
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,100
make sure you include that on your

880
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:39,689
resume and that will help you get into

881
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:41,759
the industry

882
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,920
so he goes on to say more importantly is

883
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,079
it unreasonable to set my sights on

884
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,180
becoming a grower / head grower /

885
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,939
breeder and living on that pay any

886
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:54,000
knowledge or contacts would be greatly

887
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:57,090
appreciated um so yes you can you can

888
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,619
live decently being a grower I should

889
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:01,169
not reveal what we pay

890
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,219
I had three rivers it just doesn't seem

891
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,060
appropriate

892
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,490
but the growers do make a livable wage

893
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:09,539
my friend one of my co-workers is all my

894
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,150
co-workers are my friends one of my

895
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:13,889
friends he's got a decent truck he lives

896
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,630
on his own he's got his own place and he

897
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:18,420
does all right he eats well he smokes

898
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,780
heavily and he lives off of being a grow

899
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,759
tech wage which is the I think he goes

900
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,589
trimmer and then grow tech and then in

901
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,480
our facility its trimmer grow tech and

902
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:29,669
then there's like a couple management

903
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,460
positions after that so he's just in the

904
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:35,070
second position and he's doing all right

905
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,930
I am the head grower and I obviously do

906
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,029
okay I've got a decent car I've got a

907
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:42,330
pretty big house I do it you can live

908
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:44,519
off of those wages I don't know how

909
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:45,990
lavish of a lifestyle you've got you may

910
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,160
not be rolling in the Mercedes you're

911
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,920
not hitting the strip club every night

912
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,140
you're not popping bottles but if you

913
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,750
live a modest life you can live off of a

914
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,950
grower head grower salary very

915
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:01,950
comfortably very easily a breeder unless

916
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,110
you are an established breeder with a

917
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,730
reputation there's not a lot of need for

918
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:08,219
a breeder in a commercial facility

919
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,839
nobody is making seeds right now other

920
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,990
than a couple of specialised facilities

921
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,459
and they've it's basically the owner is

922
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,190
the breeder and that happens I'm a

923
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,140
well-known breeder in Colorado I've got

924
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,610
I am i read genetics is my breeding

925
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,080
company my seed company it's available

926
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:26,039
at the dank team.com if you're

927
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:28,710
interested ah and I don't make any seeds

928
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,420
in a commercial facility that just

929
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,069
doesn't make sense right now eventually

930
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,509
there are talks at Three Rivers and I

931
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:35,129
will build a breeding facility together

932
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:36,690
and I will breed seeds in there and

933
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,150
those will be available exclusively at

934
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,910
Three Rivers but like I said that's just

935
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:45,390
in talks so don't look to make too much

936
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,830
money being a breeder being a breeder

937
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,200
would be something that you would do

938
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:50,529
more and your personal grow on your

939
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,600
private time and then

940
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:54,099
you'd grow those seeds out and then you

941
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,509
would want to get those if you want to

942
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:57,069
make any money being a breeder you've

943
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,629
got to get those seeds out get them

944
00:32:57,069 --> 00:33:00,759
known it takes a long time to get

945
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,730
established and then honestly right now

946
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:06,430
everybody is a breeder and people either

947
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:08,250
want to buy from rare dankness DNA

948
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:12,610
genetics all those guys that are winning

949
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,980
swamp boys stuff like that or they want

950
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,839
free seeds so it's hard to be a breeder

951
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,670
and make any money off of it right now I

952
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,589
do okay with the Huayra genetics line

953
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:23,200
but I'm not rolling in money for my

954
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:24,970
breeding project at all your best bet is

955
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,740
to start as a trimmer work your way up

956
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,890
is a grow assistant become a grow tech

957
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,390
then prove yourself as a lead grower

958
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,430
which sounds like you've got the the

959
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,259
potential if you've got three years in a

960
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,779
greenhouse you've got a lot more

961
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:39,220
experience than a lot of people so make

962
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:42,129
sure you can get a badge get out to

963
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,200
Colorado apply it as many places as

964
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,840
humanly possible do whatever you have to

965
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,130
do to apply it places get interviews you

966
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,079
get interviews just like you do with any

967
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,250
other job you bug the management you go

968
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,289
there you do what you need to do you

969
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,089
call you call you call I recommend you

970
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:56,500
don't shop and check on your application

971
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:58,809
at the same time once you do get an

972
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,809
interview dress sharp yeah it's the weed

973
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:03,700
industry but we need clean people we've

974
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,169
got a clean facility yeah I do have

975
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,549
dreadlocks but I keep them clean I wear

976
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,870
clean clothes to work we don't look like

977
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:10,148

trimmers once they're there for three

1008
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,690
four maybe five weeks we need

1009
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,429
at least a pound a day per trimmer out

1010
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,050

1011
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:10,639
and a half pounds there's a guy at

1012

another facility we're associated with

1013
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,848
that does nearly four pounds a day it's

1014
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,820
not the tightest trim in the world but

1015

1020
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,049
that day when you open up that bucket

1021
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:29,959

00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:43,068
that stuff I think I covered most of the

1058
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:44,509
basics on how to get a job in the

1059
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:46,250
cannabis industry it's just like any

1060
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,920
other job you guys you need to get your

1061
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,269
marijuana Enforcement Division badge

1062
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,338
that's your first step make sure you can

1063
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:53,989
do that before you even start thinking

1064
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:55,969
about coming to Colorado make sure you

1065
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,899
can get your badge if you come here and

1066
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,068
you can't get your badge

1067
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,539
you're [ __ ] you can't work in the

1068
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:01,369
industry and you got to figure out what

1069
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:02,869
to do your family's here you're here and

1070
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,608
you ain't got [ __ ] going on there's a

1071
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,780
lot of people that did that and it makes

1072
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:07,909
us kind of look bad to tell you the

1073
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,460
truth make sure you can get your badge

1074
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:11,868
then apply your ass off and then go get

1075
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,059
a job you're gonna have to start as a

1076
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:15,289
trimmer or a budtender don't be afraid

1077
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,328
to start at the bottom and work your way

1078
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:19,278
up people move up quickly

1079
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:21,259
people jump from facility to facility in

1080
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,849
this industry a lot there's a lot of

1081
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:24,949
weirdness and it's a new industry and

1082
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:26,869
people are stoners and people don't take

1083
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,189
it seriously so people get jobs and

1084
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,420
they're like cool I'm the new grower and

1085
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,818
then they [ __ ] it off because they don't

1086
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:35,298
take it seriously we fire them then we

1087
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:38,208
move up a trimmer to agro tech but I got

1088
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:40,818
my job honestly because the manager that

1089
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:42,528
was in my facility was removed from the

1090
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:44,358
management position and I was the next

1091
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,190
in line that was most experienced and

1092
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:48,858
had leadership skills I showed

1093
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:51,048
leadership skills from day one and when

1094
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:52,909
our old manager laughed at like hey

1095
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:54,650
people turned to me and they said hey

1096
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:55,848
boss man what do we do when the manager

1097
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,940
didn't show up for work the next day

1098
00:37:55,849 --> 00:38:00,200
they just everybody turned to me so

1099
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,659
start off at the bottom just like I did

1100
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,818
and you can move to the top just like I

1101
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,348
did you guys alright let's wrap up this

1102

1106
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,759
as a plant but also how much we can help

1107

here and participate and join us in

1179
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,030
legal cannabis and the beauty that these

1180
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:34,429
mountains have to offer and all of the

1181
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,190
[ __ ] seasons you get to see here I'm

1182
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:40,250
from California we had spring and

1183
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,079
summer.i in Colorado we get every season

1184
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,510
highlighted really well we get a huge

1185
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,909
winter we get a summer we get a fall we

1186
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,320
get a spring we get all the seasons come

1187
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:51,649
come enjoy them if that's what you want

1188
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,260
to do but I would recommend that you

1189
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,690
work on legalization where you are if

1190
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,480
you can't come here and do what you can

1191
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:02,179
to legalize where you are my hope is

1192
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,949
that eventually every state will be a

1193
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:06,049
cannabis legal state hopefully one day

1194
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:07,819
they'll just there won't be legalized

1195
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,890
states it'll just be legalized cannabis

1196
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,720
in the United States of America

1197
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:14,480
statewide you'll be able to travel from

1198
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,949
California to New York with your bong in

1199
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,840
the car with your weed in the car and

1200
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:19,219
nobody will give a [ __ ] unless you're

1201
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,720
hitting it of course that's not cool but

1202
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,829
you could have it you have it in the car

1203
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,449
and that's what matters I need to be

1204
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:26,239
able to drive from here to California

1205
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:27,589
with my hash and my rig in a container

1206
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,969
that is locked and sealed so that I'm

1207
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,410
not consuming on the road and have it

1208
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,849
safe and not have to worry about going

1209
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:34,909
to jail just because I'm carrying my

1210
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:36,529
medicine with me to keep my head right

1211
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,149
that's what I think I'm not trying to

1212
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,130
say don't come I'm just saying if you

1213
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,329
can't do what you can to get it legal

1214
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,740
where you are because if everybody keeps

1215
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:44,000

1216
