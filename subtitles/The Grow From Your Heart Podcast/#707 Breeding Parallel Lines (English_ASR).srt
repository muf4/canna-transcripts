41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,679
too much here at the start of the show

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
uh recently i was on my instagram live

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,799
feed that's right every monday i do an

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,720
instagram live at 7 10 p.m mountain time

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,439
i'm in colorado i'm dealing with the

46
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,000
mountain time zone so every monday 7 10

47
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,239
p.m mountain time i do an instagram live

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
i'm on my instagram account i re

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,959
underscore genetics that is me on

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,399
instagram irie underscore genetics i use

51
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,878
that one for the live feed there is a

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,639
podcast uh instagram it is the grow from

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,439
your heart podcast i don't post enough

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,279
there i try but i don't i re underscore

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,759
genetics on instagram i do an instagram

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,080
live show every monday on a recent live

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,840
show we started talking about labeling

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
and going deeper into labeling and

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
somebody asked me the question about f1s

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,239
and then they asked me the question

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,800
about what does v mean somebody noted

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,878
that the letter v was on a seed pack

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
recently we talked about the bx we

64
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,959
talked about f1 we talked about s now we

65
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,598
are going to talk about v and we're

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
going to lead that into further breeding

67
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,119
down the line we're going to talk about

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
parallel breeding in this episode so

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,360
let's start the conversation off talking

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,439
about v if you buy a package of seeds

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
and it's got the letter v marked on

72
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,598
there somewhere that can be very

73
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,439
confusing what does the letter v mean

74
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,119
i did not see the package that my friend

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,598
was talking about i'm not exactly sure

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
but i have a good idea of exactly the

77
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,280
breeder probably the line of seeds that

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
it came from so i can give a good

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
example of what i expect and i assume

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,560
this v means the v

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,840
means it is version so let's just say

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,840
hypothetically that i made a rise f twos

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,439
and the uh there were different

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,439
phenotypes that i liked i would run a

85
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,560
bunch of seeds and i would label them

86
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,079
probably number 1 through 25 or 1

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
through 100 or maybe they would be

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
letters a through z just kind of depends

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,080
on how i'm feeling when i label make the

90
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,318
labels that day in this case we're going

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
to say they were labeled numbers 1

92
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,798
through 25 and then i'm going to grow

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
those out i may find two that i really

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,840
like that have two totally distinct

95
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,119
traits features two different phenotypes

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,719
that really

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
they're both keepers in totally

98
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,439
different ways so i may work more with

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
those plants in the future and to

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,639
indicate that i chose uh maybe i got on

101
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,919
a rise plant that was super sticky and

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,079
super potent and then maybe i got

103
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,238
another arize plant that tastes really

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
good and grows really fast i would

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,319
indicate those by saying like version a

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,480
and version b and then on the website i

107
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,719
would go and indicate very clearly the

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,158
differences between version a and

109
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,239
version b

110
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,120
so i think the v just means version it's

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,438
either

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
version a or version b possibly version

113
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,279
2.0 is something i've also seen the way

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
that i have indicated that is i've just

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,679
simply given the plants different

116
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,159
numbers you may see a rise f2 number

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,439
four a rise f2 number eight there's a

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
rise f2 letter e that is the way i did

119
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,079
it those are different selections of the

120
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,679
arise phenotypes that i chose to

121
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,758
continue breeding with that is all that

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,600
indicates is a v4 version all right i am

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
back after a quick technical adjustment

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
i hope you didn't notice through the

125
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,198
magic of editing you will not notice a

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,439
thing let's stay on track here i talked

127
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560
about versions i did say i was going to

128
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,240
talk about

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,639
poly hybrids f1s and breeding parallel

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,519
lines i'm going to try to unravel that

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,319
ball here we go oftentimes in the show i

132
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,399
talk about f1s and f1 is known as when

133
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,800
we take two plants and cross them

134
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,560
together for the first time if i take

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,038
plant a that doesn't even need a name

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,478
and plant b and i breed them together

137
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
the seeds that come from that that's

138
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,079
called the progeny that is an f1 that is

139
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,399
the first filial generation now my

140
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,038
friend f1 pete his head just completely

141
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,198
exploded because unless we've done some

142
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,000
uh work before that or some very careful

143
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,319
selection that is not really nf1 it

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,959
could be labeled in f1 technically what

145
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,240
we just made is a polyhybrid we're just

146
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,399
pollen chucking we're just grabbing

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
plant a plant b putting them in a room

148
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,120
because

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,038
that one was called something cookies

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
and that was called something cake and i

151
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,839
think that something cookies and

152
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,680
something cake would be a cool [ __ ]

153
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,679
strain name that will sell me a lot of

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
seeds so i put them in a room and i let

155
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
them [ __ ] and now i got a bunch of seeds

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,478
and those are just poly hybrid hype

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
seeds

158
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,839
if you're into poly hybrids there's

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,279
nothing wrong with that if you've done

160
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
if that's what you want that's your

161
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,159
thing but that is not an f1 let's talk

162
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,879
about what would make an f1 and what the

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
difference is between a poly hybrid and

164
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,120
an f1 the main word is um breeding two

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
the main thing is breeding two

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,000
heterozygous plants together to create

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,879
an f1 if you're taking something that's

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,478
really uh og kush dominant and a lot of

169
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,079
kush on this side and a lot of kush on

170
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,359
this side you're just kind of pollen

171
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,439
chucking and putting kush and other

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
ingredients together let's do some work

173
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,120
do some building blocks let's talk about

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,720
how to do this and this will also take

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,079
us back to the versions so the main when

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
i'm breeding one of the things i really

177
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,680
look for is breeding plants that are

178
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,279
different why would i want to take

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
two strawberries and make strawberries

180
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,638
together and get double strawberries

181
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880
that doesn't make any sense to me i want

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
to take strawberries and blueberries or

183
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,240
strawberries and chocolate or

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
strawberries and not even bananas

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
because that's too cliche how about

186
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,918
strawberries and garlic let's just [ __ ]

187
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,679
it all up let's do things weird and

188
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,758
breed that and try to complement both

189
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,720
plants and see what they both do also

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,639
that helps us get to that f1 stage so

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,560
in my example again i'm going to go back

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
to making a rise we're going to work

193
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
with a golden goat female and we're

194
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,160
going to focus on a daybreaker male

195
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
that's where we're going to go i'm going

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
to flower them out and i'm going to get

197
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,479
pollen from the daybreaker i'm going to

198
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,598
put the pollen on the golden goat female

199
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,439
i have now made a rise f1 that is a real

200
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,279
thing that i've done i've called that a

201
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,680
rise f1

202
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,198
that could be debatably an f1 depl

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,918
debatably you could deflate it if you

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,120
want to also that may not be a true f1

205
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:34,240
it may be um those plants were so far

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,680
apart i think in appearance in genetics

207
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,519
and everything that i think i made in f1

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,759
maybe people would argue that and i

209
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,680
would accept your argument um they could

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
be a poly hybrid if you want to call it

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,759
that let's talk about what i could do to

212
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,519
further turn this plant into a true f1

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
if we want to really fit that label that

214
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,000
our friend fp f1p would like to see this

215
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,159
plant fall into shout out to my friend

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,079
f1p you're a very inspiring a very

217
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
knowledgeable dude and you did inspire a

218
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,839
lot of this and i learned a lot from you

219
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
brother so thank you let's keep going so

220
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,279
i've got my first arize f1 or my poly

221
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,439
hybrid stash of seeds from there i'm

222
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,878
going to find a male let's go back to

223
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,160
talking about the versions this is where

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,080
the versions are going to come in let me

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
keep myself on track from there i'm

226
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,439
going to grow them out and i'm going to

227
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,439
find traits that i really enjoy this is

228
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,879
just what you do when you get seeds a

229
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,478
batch of new seeds you grow them you

230
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,240
look for the traits what are these new

231
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,719
uh what is is what does the progeny

232
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,319
express you grow as many as you can and

233
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
through that population you take a lot

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
of notes and you say this is a common

235
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
trait this is a common trait this is

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,200
really common 25 percent of the plants

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,200
show me this 25 show me this 50 percent

238
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
of the plants show me this ten percent

239
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,959
of the plants did this weird [ __ ] over

240
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,199
here ten percent of the plants did this

241
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,199
amazing thing over here take a lot of

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
notes and see what you have created put

243
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
that plant in different environments

244
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,319
stress it out run it as many times as

245
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,479
you can see what you can do with this

246
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
plant how it reacts to different things

247
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
then

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
then if you really want to go further

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
find uh there are going to be two

250
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,159
different traits that you like two

251
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,000
different plants that you're looking for

252
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,240
i'm going to pick two very specific

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
traits once again we're going to say on

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,039
this side we have found a plant that is

255
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
super potent every time we smoke it i

256
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,879
said this before your brain flies out of

257
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
your head you got fireworks going off

258
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,480
every time we're gonna stick with a

259
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,000
super potent plant on this side on the

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,639
other side i'm gonna stick with

261
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,120
something we all enjoy terps flavor

262
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,278
whatever your favorite flavor is that is

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,240
on this side so i've got one line of

264
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,480
plants that are nothing but potency and

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
one breeding project that is nothing but

266
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,879
flavor an easy way to achieve this one

267
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,278
way we can do this is to use the same

268
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,360
male or two different males if you found

269
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,958
two males that you really like you want

270
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
to run two totally different breeding

271
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,119
projects that is acceptable that's a

272
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,119
great way to do this you can run one

273
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
male or two males this will work however

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
you want as long as you have found the

275
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
plants that meet the criteria and reach

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,159
the goals you were looking for uh you

277
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
can do two different males or the same

278
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,759
male that won't make a difference uh in

279
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,399
my opinion so what we're gonna do we're

280
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,879
gonna find that female super potent find

281
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,559
another female super flavor then we're

282
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,240
going to pollinate them with our male of

283
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,000
choice it's either it's got to be the

284
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
same filial generation is the most

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
important part here it could be the same

286
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,000
male uh could be two two different males

287
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,159
as long as they came from the same batch

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
of seeds so now we are going to find

289
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,319
that perfect male uh that perfect

290
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
perfect male if it's one or two find our

291
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
perfect females we've got our female a

292
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,720
and female b now we're going to

293
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,958
pollinate at this point we have made two

294
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,720
separate batches of f2 seeds we have

295
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:39,039
made f2 batch a and f2 batch b you can

296
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
do this at separate times if you've got

297
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,399
uh if you're doing different males you

298
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,000
might want to do it in separate rooms at

299
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,078
different times so you don't cross

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
pollinate if you're using one male you

301
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,759
can do this in one room you can

302
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,278
pollinate plant a and plant b as long as

303
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
you don't mix up the seeds when you're

304
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,120
done that will work out beautifully so

305
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,040
what you would do what i would do

306
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,839
you've made the f1 or the poly hybrid

307
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,399
generation find a solid male in this

308
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,800
case i found king solomon then i would

309
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,958
find a female nothing but potency a

310
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,039
female over here nothing but terps i

311
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,399
keep saying nothing but uh that's wrong

312
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,120
i shouldn't be saying it that way we

313
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,159
want structure vigor uh pathogen

314
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
pathogen resistance bug resistance uh

315
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,360
all of the other things you desire in a

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
plant that you're going to breed to it

317
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,079
needs that but also let's focus

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,919
90 of your focus is going to be on the

319
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,359
trichomes on the potency over here i

320
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,519
don't know about 90 i'm exaggerating

321
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
that that's hyperbole most of our focus

322
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,839
we're breeding mostly for potency over

323
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
here the other side breeding mostly for

324
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
flavor so you're going to get your

325
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,799
you're going to select that you're going

326
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,958
to have your male then i would take that

327
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,919
male and pollinate both of those

328
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,078
now i have now made the f2 or i guess

329
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,159
it's the f2 but not really the true f2

330
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,838
working toward our real f1 is where

331
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,078
we're headed we'll get to that so i'm

332
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
going to make new seeds i'm going to

333
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,359
take this batch over here that i'm

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
breeding just for flavor and i'm going

335
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,240
to find another boy and another girl out

336
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,440
of there in this selection process i am

337
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,919
focused once again on structure vigor

338
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,040
resistance to problems but i am focusing

339
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,799
mainly on flavor once again then guess

340
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,639
what once i found that perfect male and

341
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,879
perfect female out of my f2 batch of

342
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,320
this batch of seeds out of batch a i

343
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,480
don't remember which side was batch and

344
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
which side was which b batch b but we're

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,079
just gonna act like this is flavor batch

346
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
over here we've got our f twos we're

347
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,759
gonna make f3 we're going to find a

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,679
beautiful flavored plant again we're

349
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,519
going to make f4 we're going to go all

350
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,439
the way to f5 or f6 i want to go until

351
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,879
these plants come out every time i grow

352
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,800
them they are stable stabil stability

353
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,720
means that all of the plants are uniform

354
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,399
uniformity among phenotypes we're not

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,959
going to find a bunch of different

356
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,559
phenotypes in the in the population not

357
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,599
going to be any differences they're

358
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,359
going to look like we put a bunch of

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,959
clones out there that's how far i'm

360
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,759
going to breed it if i do my selection

361
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,759
properly f5 should get me there f6 will

362
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,039
really lock it in so what are we going

363
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,519
to do with these other plants that we're

364
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,679
focused on the potency side same thing

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,560
i've got my f1 seeds i'm going to find a

366
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,000
boy and a girl across those make f2s

367
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,319
find a boy and a girl that are highly

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
potent cross those i keep going up like

369
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
this like like there's a chart in front

370
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,600
of me but there is in my head so i'm

371
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,919
going to do that to both lines this is

372
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
what i'm calling parallel lines it's the

373
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,000
same genetics it's the same cross it's

374
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,759
the same genotype but i'm choosing

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,559
different phenotypes with different

376
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,799
goals in mind for my breeding once again

377
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,719
i'm just breeding for potency just

378
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,879
reading for flavor in two separate

379
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,800
projects i've got to use

380
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,559
the same batch of seeds over here to

381
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,479
make this work and the same

382
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,559
the the batch of seeds over here that is

383
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,320
allotted for this project over here the

384
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,559
potency seeds have to stay in the

385
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,639
potency rain the flavor seeds have to

386
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,239
stay in the flavor rain and run right up

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,320
that side of the chart so we're going to

388
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,680
f f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 both of them right up

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,680
each side then once we get to that f5 f6

390
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,439
level and we feel like we've got exactly

391
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,159
what we're looking for from our

392
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,720
phenotypes we're going to find a

393
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,838
beautifully perfectly structured

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,839
pathogen resistant bug resistant not

395
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,720
problematic plant that is ideal for our

396
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,399
grow room that is got the most amazing

397
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,160
[ __ ] flavor you could ever find

398
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
whatever flavor you think of when you

399
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,159
close your eyes and you inhale that

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
imaginary joint or imaginary dab or

401
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,399
imaginary bong rip and you go

402
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,639
whatever flavor that is that hits your

403
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,799
tongue this plant tastes just like that

404
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,959
times five it's almost overwhelming

405
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,958
almost overpowering because we've bred

406
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,039
it just focusing on that delicious

407
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,559
terpene content then we're going to find

408
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,039
one over here on the other side on the

409
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,319
potency side then when you open the bag

410
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,919
you don't even have to light it you

411
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
don't even have to put fire on it you

412
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,958
just go oh [ __ ] i'm too high to drive

413
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,240
somebody else has to drive the car

414
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,759
that's how high i want you to get from

415
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
that weed we're going to find a

416
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,759
phenotype that is perfect you got to

417
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,198
trust now which one which one do we

418
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,198
choose for the male i would say choose

419
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,799
the potency side for the male that would

420
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,039
be my idea but now what we're going to

421
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,198
do we're going to cross these together

422
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,919
we're going to take our f sixes from

423
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,159
each side or f5 from each side and pick

424
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,399
your potency male and your flavorful

425
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,278
female and cross them let's breed those

426
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,159
together now my friends we have made a

427
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,159
true

428
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:17,039
f1 cross we've taken uh these uh parents

429
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:20,480
that were golden goat and daybreaker and

430
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,958
we made the poly hybrid version uh part

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,278
one and then we selected version a and

432
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:29,039
version b and we bred them to f2 f3 f456

433
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,519
then we found our crown jewels out of

434
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:36,000
those we bred those together and we made

435
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,759
[ __ ] super arise the true f1 um that

436
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
would be a baddie uh that's like a

437
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,159
lifeline lifelong project for a lot of

438
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
people don't think that that's something

439
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,559
you should get done in just a few years

440
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,720
if you rush it you [ __ ] that project up

441
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,399
and if you ever have to go backwards

442
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
if one of your selections wasn't what

443
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,159
you thought it should be if you liked

444
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
the filial generation before never be

445
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,759
afraid to go back and crack more seeds

446
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,440
from that generation before find the

447
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,079
phenotype out of there you know when you

448
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
mess up you you'll see it it may be two

449
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,519
generations back but you'll know which

450
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
generation once you're breeding uh

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,600
filial generations and you see a problem

452
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,199
pop up you go oh yeah that was in two

453
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,399
generations back and i was too stubborn

454
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,319
to get rid of that i should have tossed

455
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,000
that plant i picked that plant because

456
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
it did that other thing that i liked and

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,440
i accepted the crazy thing uh just

458
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,679
because it had that other cool trait so

459
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
get rid of that um don't be afraid to go

460
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,838
backwards

461
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,198
always keep seed stock from every filial

462
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,240
generation

463
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,278
if you're making f2s f3s f4s you should

464
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,919
have f1 two three and four seed stock

465
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,600
just on reserve like i said just in case

466
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,000
you did not make the appropriate the

467
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,360
correct selection every time maybe later

468
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,759
on you want to take that uh f6 or f5 and

469
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
back cross it to an f2 or something

470
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
you'll once you start doing this you'll

471
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,720
see why breeding becomes so

472
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,359
i guess addicting as the word and then

473
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,680
you'll see how it also becomes very uh

474
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,839
predictive we can kind of once you do it

475
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,198
a lot you can almost anticipate what's

476
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
going to come out if you learn the

477
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,879
plants if you understand what's

478
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,240
happening um

479
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,120
you have to breed with the plants a

480
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,880
couple of times to see how much of that

481
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,798
male goes into the mix and how much of

482
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,160
that female goes into the mix and then

483
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,679
you'll see that different males and

484
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
females interact differently but the

485
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,360
only way to do that really is to breed

486
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,519
