15
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,359
preparing for our outdoor Harvest many

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,460
people have been working all summer long

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,079
most of the fall on their outdoor

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,539
Gardens and it is quickly approaching

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,640
Harvest Time this is a very critical

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,100
part of the growing process many people

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,558
Overlook the preparations and

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,540
expectations and needs of harvest time

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,879
so let's do a little quick talk here and

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
get everybody prepared to harvest their

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,298
outdoor Garden all right now when it

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,460
comes to harvesting our outdoor plants

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,860
the first thing I would think about is

28
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:20,039
where are we going to put this Harvest

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,959
we need a safe secure location to put

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,939
all of our plants when we chop them down

31
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,739
we can't just stack them up we can't

32
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,298
just pile them up in a corner they need

33
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,519
to hang they need airflow they need

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,460
space they need a controlled environment

35
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,618
do you have that area prepared do you

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,419
have something in mind start cleaning

37
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,459
that room out now because life gets

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,259
chaotic around Harvest time and you're

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,179
going to find yourself overwhelmed and

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,219
overloaded and the last thing you want

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,079
is to be scrambling for a dry and cure

42
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,700
space while you're chopping down the

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,618
plants let's get prepared we still have

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,659
a little bit of time before Harvest time

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,959
comes up let's start thinking about this

46
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,640
stuff now set yourself up for Success at

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,319
this point we've got time to start

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,299
looking for the tools and supplies in

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,798
space which is needed for Harvest maybe

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,899
even you need a few friends we'll talk

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,000
about that later on but let's start

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,159
preparing now before these plants come

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,800
down like I said a moment ago let's set

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,180
ourselves up for Success you have spent

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,520
weeks those plants have been outside

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
vegging for a couple a few weeks maybe

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,120
even vegged indoors for a couple of

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,560
weeks if you do big plants you vegged

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,659
them indoors you vegged them Outdoors

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,699
they flowered for eight to ten weeks

61
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,199
outside you took major care of them

62
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,299
every day you were out there watering

63
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,039
them defoliating keeping the bugs off of

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,900
them now at the Harvest Time this is

65
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,400
where we could really screw up all of

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,159
the love and care that we put into these

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,439
plants so let's be prepared the first

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,120
thing we need is that dry and cure space

69
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,439
do you have somewhere that when you cut

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,719
down the plants do you have somewhere

71
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,759
you can hang these plants safely you

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
need a room that I prefer a dark room if

73
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,479
there's a little bit of light in there

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,060
that is okay but I definitely prefer a

75
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,039
dark room for hanging the plants do you

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,959
have a room that is secure is this room

77
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,120
that you're thinking about secure is it

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,979
not accessible to Children is the main

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,019
important thing then the second thing is

80
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,419
is it accessible to thieves do people

81
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,159
know your ganja is in there is it locked

82
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,839
up safe and secure do you have cameras

83
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,639
do you have maybe a little alarm system

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,680
in case somebody gets in there but

85
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,359
definitely have a safe and secure place

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,219
for these plants we don't need the kids

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,780
getting in there we don't need thieves

88
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,158
getting in there we definitely don't

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,658
want animals to get in there if it's

90
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,818
your own domestic pets if it's wild

91
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,560
animals outside they're gonna love the

92
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,238
smell of that ganja and they may try to

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,158
get to it and they may try to eat it up

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
a lot of animals love the smell of

95
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,120
cannabis rats bunnies uh anything like

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,039
that they will get to your plants if

97
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,319
it's available and they will try to eat

98
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,598
it so you need plenty of space a secure

99
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,579
place with little white we also need

100
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,738
some airflow in this room are we getting

101
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,420
some airflow in there a room that uh let

102
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,920
me back up and this isn't even on my

103
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,199
notes this just came to my mind because

104
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,658
this is very important we want a room

105
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,459
that doesn't have a funky stanky musty

106
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:53,280
Aroma because if you hang these plants

107
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,378
in a funky stanky room instead of

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
getting good ganja smelling buds they

109
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:00,658
are going to absorb that funky musty

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,280
basement Aroma into the plants so think

111
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,620
about that when you are now that we're

112
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,419
preparing a dry and cure space maybe we

113
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,920
can clean out a room and open up some

114
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,658
windows and get some air in there and

115
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,938
get that old basement Funk smell out of

116
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,098
there or that old barn smell or that old

117
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:15,419
work shed smell whatever it is let's

118
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,519
freshen it up a little bit let's get

119
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,079
some airflow happening now so we can

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,060
freshen up the air in that room get rid

121
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,639
of some of that old nasty stale Aroma

122
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,560
whatever it may be because that will end

123
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,000
up into your buds instead of your buds

124
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,978
smelling like Grateful Dog or Morning

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,300
Dew or strawberry Starburst they're

126
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,639
going to smell like grandma's basement

127
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,220
and nobody wants to smoke that [Â __Â ] so

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,139
think about the uh the smell the aroma

129
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,419
that is already existing in your

130
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,460
anticipated dry space then the next

131
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:44,099
thing I wanted to talk about was airflow

132
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,620
we can start cleaning that funky air out

133
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,419
now if we get some airflow going you're

134
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,220
going to want air flow in the grow in

135
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,959
the dry space I would put a couple of

136
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,639
fans in there one up higher one down

137
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,519
lower maybe even one on the ground

138
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,740
stirring the uh the ground air around we

139
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,539
don't want the wind blowing directly on

140
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,519
the plants drying them out we want the

141
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,500
wind moving it around so that we don't

142
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,599
get any micro climates any Hot Pockets

143
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,120
any wet pockets in the room let's just

144
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,740
move and stir all of that air also if

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,019
you've got some sort of an exhaust fan

146
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,639
in that room to vent out that humidity I

147
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,620
out of the top Corner out of the top

148
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,439
middle of that room that would be ideal

149
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,759
also maybe consider a carbon filter in

150
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,680
that room if you've got neighbors

151
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,300
thieves something like that may smell

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,280
your ganja crop as you're drying it in

153
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,560
that room you're exhausting that nice

154
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,959
ganja scented air I would put a carbon

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,019
filter on there another thing to think

156
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,359
about is maybe a dehumidifier in your

157
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,339
dry and cure space when I've got plants

158
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,800
hanging in a commercial room I honestly

159
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,839
put a humidifier in one corner a

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
dehumidifier in the other corner I set

161
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,519
them both at 55 percent and I let them

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,620
fight all day so that room stays at 55

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,120
percent constantly unless we're opening

164
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,579
and closing the doors that does happen

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,959
but we with the moisture of the plants

166
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,478
in there the humidifier and the

167
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,978
dehumidifier battling we can get pretty

168
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,439
close to the parameters which we expect

169
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,879
in that room at all times also of course

170
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,439
I'm running a commercial facility when

171
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,879
I'm talking about this there's an air

172
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,918
conditioner in the commercial facility

173
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,459
we keep that at the desired temperature

174
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,719
about 60 65 degrees maybe between 60 and

175
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,939
70. I understand a lot of you are

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,680
drawing in a basement in your extra grow

177
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:19,379
room in your garage in the tool shed

178
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
we're going to try to meet certain

179
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,399
parameters it would be ideal to get

180
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,199
within five degrees or five percent

181
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,758
humidity but I understand that's not

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,919
always possible we may have to be

183
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,259
flexible and work with the 10 degree 10

184
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,560
threshold here that will work for you

185
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,139
let's try to stay right around 55 65 60

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
maybe the ideal temperature and humidity

187
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,918
a lot of people are going to have input

188
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,079
and different thoughts on that it's all

189
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,879
going to work just adjust as you find

190
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,000
necessary these are just guidelines for

191
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,800
you to start with 50 humidity sixty

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
percent humidity those will both work

193
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,400
you're just going to take a little bit

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,439
longer a little bit shorter time to dry

195
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,179
so think about the aroma in that room

196
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,240
think about the airflow in that room

197
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,340
like I said we don't want fans blowing

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,079
directly onto the plants all day would

199
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,879
you want fans blowing on you maybe some

200
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,918
of you weirdos do but you don't want it

201
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,839
blowing directly on you all day just

202
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,120
stir that air around don't dry the buds

203
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,159
out with the fan let them dry slowly but

204
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,139
have that fan moving the air around if

205
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,939
you need to rotate the plants so that

206
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,038
one isn't always getting beat up by the

207
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,959
fan at all times feel free to rotate

208
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,519
those plants so something I didn't even

209
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,318
talk about how are you going to hang

210
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,818
these plants in the room let's just say

211
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,259
that you've chosen a space in which to

212
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,539
hang your plants if you're using your

213
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,979
grow tent that's ideal also a lot of

214
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:33,899
people just cut down the plants and then

215
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:35,699
hang them right up in the grow tent but

216
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,159
how are you going to hang them what are

217
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,500
you going to use to suspend your plants

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
from the ceiling the rafters how is it

219
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,759
going to work one thing I recommend I

220
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,019
suggest that happens a lot and this is

221
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,720
great even if you're doing this and

222
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,399
you're grow tip this will work very well

223
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,199
buy a thing of clothes hangers just the

224
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,818
cheap plastic triangle clothes hangers

225
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,620
the little hook on the top you don't

226
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,240
need anything expensive anything fancy

227
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,800
if you're a broke ass get the wire ones

228
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,259
if you can even find the wire hangers

229
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,000
anymore but get some coat hangers and

230
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,319
then when you cut your plant pay

231
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,939
attention to the way that you're cutting

232
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
the plant if you watch the way the

233
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,019
cannabis plant grows it makes a stock

234
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,459
that comes up then it makes a branch

235
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,079
that comes off to the side than just

236
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,060
above that a branch that comes off to

237
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,219
the side if you cut the plant down

238
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,780
properly think about come from the top

239
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,000
of the plant work your way down a few

240
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,559
inches maybe I'm going to say about 10

241
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,478
12 inches I think that's probably about

242
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
10 or 12 inches then that's a good

243
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,740
section to cut if you find one of the

244
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,180
intersections where the main stock comes

245
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,459
off and there's a branch coming up this

246
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,860
way cut right below that you can use

247
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,658
that Branch as the hanger flip that

248
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,979
upside down put that on your coat hanger

249
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,259
and now you can hang that hanger

250
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,180
wherever you want depending on how big

251
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,038
your buds are how dense and fat and

252
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,139
beefy your branches and buds have gotten

253
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,480
you can probably fit several of those

254
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,919
branches per coat hanger don't waste too

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,019
much space and just do one bud per

256
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,120
hanger do at least three that's my

257
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,919
opinion so continue chopping your plants

258
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,259
start at the top take that main top off

259
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,639
cut it put it on the coat hanger have

260
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,679
the hanger hang it up on something so

261
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,539
you can access right then go down a

262
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,039
little further cut in sections that you

263
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,860
feel comfortable with and hang those up

264
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,659
and hang those up in that cool secure

265
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,240
place that dark place with plenty of

266
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,879
airflow and a controlled temperature and

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,039
humidity temperature humidity and

268
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,838
airflow are super important in the

269
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,419
drying and curing process

270
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,180
if you don't have enough airflow if you

271
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:27,000
get too much humidity you can definitely

272
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,799
ruin your buds by creating Bud rot it is

273
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,480
still potentially an issue to ruin the

274
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,000
inside of those buds with the wrong

275
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,519
environment so get that room dialed in

276
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,320
get the temperature down 60 or lower get

277
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,820
that temperature right let's get an

278
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,860
exhaust fan in there let's get some air

279
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,379
moving and let's try to get the water

280
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,120
out of those plants as slowly and

281
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,039
quickly as possible I know that sounds

282
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
redundant but as a grower that's what

283
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,000
you're trying to do you want it to dry

284
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,800
as slowly and quickly as possible you'll

285
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,958
figure this out when you get there the

286
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,819
longer the drying process takes the

287
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,159
better the weed will taste but the

288
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,300
longer it takes the longer it [Â __Â ]

289
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,219
takes which means there's more

290
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,500
opportunity for issues and problems to

291
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,000
arise once you pass a certain moisture

292
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,379
level don't even worry about it if

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,059
they're hanging you've got airflow you

294
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,620
will be fine if the first few days is

295
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,299
when you do really need to pay attention

296
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,639
and make sure that you've got plenty of

297
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,859
airflow and that your humidity is under

298
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,360
control now if we do have a drying and

299
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,220
curing space figured out a place where

300
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,839
we can hang the these plants let's

301
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,440
review what we need we need a dark room

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:29,399
that is secure with airflow and about 50

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,980
to 60 percent uh 55 to 65 percent uh

304
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,360
humidity and temperature in that room

305
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,860
like I said a moment ago in my

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,980
commercial environment I have a

307
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,740
dehumidifier set at 55 humidity I have a

308
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,959
humidifier set at 55 humidity I've got

309
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,220
an air conditioner set at 60 degrees at

310
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,439
the other end of the room I've got an

311
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,420
era a duck sucking air out so that all

312
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,220
of my stale warm air that Rose to the

313
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,319
top with all that humidity in there is

314
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,700
just being pulled right from the room in

315
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,800
a commercial environment I don't put

316
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,540
that carbon filter on there in a private

317
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,278
grow put that carbon filter on there so

318
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,599
everybody doesn't smell it but that is

319
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,100
the main setup we've got the

320
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,320
environmental controls happening in

321
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,060
there that also put a hygrometer in

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,860
there so that you can look and see what

323
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,319
is happening in that room at all times

324
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,820
uh something like you could just get the

325
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,200
little cheap one from the the local

326
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,300
hardware store that just sits on the

327
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,860
table and you can look at it manually or

328
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,719
you can get a pulse Pro and you can look

329
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,579
at it on your phone you've got so many

330
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,019
options for that but be aware of what's

331
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,299
happening in there so that you can

332
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,440
adjust it if you need to all right those

333
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,199
are the first things I would think about

334
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,779
that is the dry and cure space what

335
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,519
about some workspace how are you going

336
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:33,899
to manage chopping this down do you have

337
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,820
some space where you can cut these

338
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,740
plants down carry them to another table

339
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,940
then do some work with them or do you

340
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,100
need to do it all out in the field where

341
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,019
the plants are be prepared for that I

342
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,060
don't know your situation I know many

343
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,919
people so let's just hypothetically say

344
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,419
I've got a greenhouse out in the middle

345
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,578
of nowhere and that Greenhouse doesn't

346
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,078
have like a lot of work space for a

347
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,059
bunch of big plants once I cut them down

348
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,219
I've got one table that whole table is

349
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,599
covered by one plant maybe I can take

350
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,700
the plant carry it to that one table

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,259
break it down into smaller pieces then

352
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,300
put it on my coat hangers there and then

353
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,980
move it to my dry and cure space maybe

354
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,539
I'll take the whole plant to my dry and

355
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,519
cure space hang it all up at once and

356
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,500
then break it into smaller pieces it

357
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,299
just depends on your environment your

358
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,159
space what you've got the thing I'm

359
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,078
trying to get at is be prepared many

360
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,639
people Overlook the importance of the

361
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,739
workspace they think about I've got this

362
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,720
room where you going to do the work

363
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,480
another thing you want to think about is

364
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,879
supplies now is the time to get supplies

365
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,860
let's not wait until Harvest day to say

366
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,419
oh yeah I needed things what are we

367
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,339
going to need when it comes to harvest

368
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,219
time the main thing you're going to need

369
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,500
is gloves I go through lots of pairs of

370
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,759
gloves harvesting I put on thicker

371
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,200
gloves while I'm chopping down the

372
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,759
plants I wear thicker gloves when it

373
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,560
comes to shucking but when it actually

374
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,720
comes to the trimming the manicuring the

375
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,939
de-leafing part of the trim work I will

376
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,379
go through a lot of gloves another thing

377
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,579
I should add that I may have forgotten

378
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,500
to talk about that just came to my head

379
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,239
while I'm thinking about harvesting is a

380
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,120
few days before you harvest this could

381
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,639
happen uh seven five three days maybe

382
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,320
even the day before Harvest if you can

383
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,240
pull off a bunch of those big leaves

384
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,040
anything with a long pedial sticking off

385
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,139
if you and your trim crew can go and

386
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,578
just pull off all of those leaves that

387
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,220
will save you time when it comes to

388
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,259
harvesting all of those leaves just dry

389
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,940
up around the plant they become crusty

390
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,220
they become crispy it becomes a big mess

391
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,600
it's extra [Â __Â ] to manage when it does

392
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,459
come time to Manicure if you can pull

393
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,220
pull those off while the plant is alive

394
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,599
they come off much more easily it's just

395
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,740
quicker just go in and just pull all

396
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
those leaves off you don't even need

397
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,759
scissors for it just take off the leaves

398
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,860
you could pop off with your fingers that

399
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,539
will also speed up your drying time if

400
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,600
you're in a place where you are drying

401
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,799
too quickly maybe don't do that but if

402
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,899
you're in a place where you want to kind

403
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,578
of speed up the dry get those leaves out

404
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,139
of there that gets more moisture out of

405
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,599
the room immediately that's going to fix

406
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,820
the humidity and the drying cure space

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,500
and also that saves you less [Â __Â ] that

408
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,120
you have to clean up and Trim in the

409
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,059
future so get those leaves out of there

410
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
maybe a good start now let's see what

411
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,359
else are we going to need gloves I said

412
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,639
we need a lot of gloves if you're going

413
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,440
to trim by yourself get your size gloves

414
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,360
if you've got friends coming over be

415
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,639
considerate maybe buy an extra large a

416
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,500
large medium and a small box if most of

417
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,299
the time you won't use the small gloves

418
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,039
the small rubber gloves are super tiny

419
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,838
most people don't wear those check

420
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,519
around look and see what your crew wears

421
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,500
and just make sure to have gloves on

422
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,240
deck for everybody and the crew that is

423
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,578
super polite of you and then nobody's

424
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,778
gonna get their fingers all sticky and

425
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,000
then also you're not going to get their

426
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,679
skin in your weed and then if somebody

427
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
gets an eye itch or a booger itch they

428
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,659
could just take off their glove and

429
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
handle it they don't have to go wash

430
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,620
their hands just to itch their eye when

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,778
you're trimming this is not on my notes

432
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,419
this is just from experience don't rub

433
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,100
your eyes or do try it one time and then

434
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,019
you'll never do it again but my advice

435
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,240
is don't rub your eyes when you're

436
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,039
trimming not at all not a little bit not

437
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,440
with the corner of your finger not with

438
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,299
the back of your hand just don't do it

439
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,500
your whole hands are going to be sticky

440
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,299
you're covered in resin you got

441
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,578
trichomes and chlorophyll all over your

442
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,979
hands as soon as that finger hits your

443
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,899
eye your body's gonna go you [Â __Â ] up

444
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,699
about 20 seconds later you're just going

445
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,259
to be in the bathroom going oh man it

446
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,939
burns bro and you're just going to be

447
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,679
rubbing your eye and your hands are

448
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,360
sticky because you've been trimming and

449
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,679
your eye is sticky and then when you

450
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,120
move your hand away from your eye your

451
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,198
[Â __Â ] eyelashes are going to stick to

452
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,360
your fingers

453
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,740
just don't do it dude that's my advice

454
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,079
don't touch your eyes when you're

455
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,000
trimming uh use gloves if you're high or

456
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,319
nose itches take off the gloves take

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
care of your eye your nose do whatever

458
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,860
you got to do then apply a fresh glove

459
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,139
don't be a cheap ass and keeper using

460
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,940
gloves they're not that expensive put on

461
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,240
a new glove all right other things you

462
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,220
might need scissors have at least one

463
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
pair of scissors on deck for every

464
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,300
person that you plan to trim with you

465
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,740
everybody needs at least one pair but

466
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,838
after a few minutes of trimming those

467
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,519
scissors are going to get sticky as [Â __Â ]

468
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,500
A lot of times what we'll do we'll just

469
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,480
have a bucket of dirty scissors a bucket

470
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,339
of clean scissors when yours get dirty

471
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,500
throw them into that dirty pile grab a

472
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,240
clean pair of scissors somebody in your

473
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,860
crew will take it upon themselves maybe

474
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,659
it's you there's always a person in this

475
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,919
group somebody will say I'm sick of

476
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:57,480
looking at the dirty scissors they'll

477
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,979
grab the dirty scissors and they will

478
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,899
start cleaning all of those scissors

479
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,820
what is customary

480
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,379
as they take all that scissor hash that

481
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,940
comes off the scissors and they put it

482
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,799
in the middle of the table and that is

483
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,839
now smoke for the table if anybody in

484
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,639
the room wants to get stoned smoke that

485
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,220
scissor hash bro that [Â __Â ] is good stuff

486
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,198
that is Mike's favorite [Â __Â ] to smoke I

487
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,879
think Mike really loves scissor hash so

488
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,919
uh when you're trimming throw those

489
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,078
dirty scissors into a little pile then

490
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,399
somebody in the crew and maybe you who

491
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,559
knows there's always somebody that likes

492
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,419
to do that the one person with OCD will

493
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,159
grab all those scissors clean them up

494
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,078
take all that resin off there roll it up

495
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,458
into a ball maybe they'll even be polite

496
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,379
enough to pack it into a bowl and get

497
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,359
that going around for everybody but

498
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,278
rotate scissors out have enough scissors

499
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,899
for everybody and then have maybe a

500
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,179
backup pair for everybody also I know

501
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,458
that adds up quite quickly but then also

502
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,500
have something on Deck to clean those

503
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,119
other scissors I like to use a small

504
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,860
razor blade just to scrape all the [Â __Â ]

505
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,459
off of it and then I soak them in

506
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,919
rubbing alcohol like 91 ISO if you have

507
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,838
some of the Dark Crystal glass cleaner

508
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,939
that also works very well to clean

509
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,339
scissors also a little bit of coconut

510
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,078
oil will get that extra residue off of

511
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,818
your skin off your fingers if you got

512
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,379
some up here on your arms or whatever a

513
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,720
little bit of coconut oil will help that

514
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,939
rub off so have gloves have scissors for

515
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,338
everybody have a way to clean those

516
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,980
scissors have a backup pair of scissors

517
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,659
for everybody if possible another thing

518
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,939
if you can get them have the little

519
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,319
springs for your scissors have backups

520
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,480
of those because you have no idea until

521
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,099
you get down to it you have no idea how

522
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,720
many pairs of those scissors the spring

523
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,519
is going to fly out the spring is going

524
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,200
to get stuck if you can get the scissors

525
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,839
they come with the backup spring I

526
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,120
recommend purchasing those another thing

527
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,459
you will need is some sort of trash

528
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,759
receptacle a trash bag a trash can

529
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,279
something to put leaves and trim and

530
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,200
sticks and waste into another thing to

531
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,418
think about is where are all of your

532
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,919
sticks and stems and empty pots and all

533
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,720
that [Â __Â ] where's that going to go when

534
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,179
you're done are you going to recycle

535
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,160
upcycle your soil are you doing a living

536
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,320
soil where you can just keep going did

537
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,179
you do Cocoa did you do uh what else is

538
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,918
the other option uh maybe you did some

539
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,320
hydroton Maybe maybe you did rockwool

540
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,120
cubes what are you going to do with your

541
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,678
waste I don't know where your grow is

542
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,839
taking place are you in a legal state

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,460
are you in a Prohibition state if you're

544
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,199
in a legal State it's much easier to

545
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,419
dispose of your waste but still be

546
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,400
careful because if somebody Drives By

547
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,020
and sees a bunch of five gallon pots

548
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,940
outside in your bag of Fox Farms left

549
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,319
over soil and a bunch of sticks they

550
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,419
know you just harvested they know

551
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,980
there's a crop in the house if it's law

552
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,538
enforcement they want to check on your

553
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,038
crop and see how much you got if it's

554
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,779
thieves they want to come get your crop

555
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,119
if it's the homies they want to come

556
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,038
smoke your crop be discreet with your

557
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,519
trash whether it's illegal or illegal

558
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,038
place in most locations once your trash

559
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,019
goes to your curb that is now fair game

560
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,940
law enforcement does not need any sort

561
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,558
of Warrant to go through your trash

562
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,080
think about that when you're putting

563
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,058
your trash at the curb maybe just maybe

564
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,579
you need to find a safer more discreet

565
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:56,339
place to get rid of your trash hopefully

566
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:57,779
maybe you're living in a rural area and

567
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,939
you can just throw it all in the compost

568
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,500
bin that would be ideal but I do

569
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,120
understand that's not option for

570
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,558
everybody I want you guys all to be

571
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,899
successful and I want you all to be

572
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,700
careful so that trash can be used as

573
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,860
evidence just as much as your harvested

574
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,200
product so keep that in mind wherever

575
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,779
you are the other thing I mentioned is

576
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,240
some hangers or some wire of some sort

577
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,740
and some little screw hooks let me talk

578
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,179
about what I'm talking about we need to

579
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,038
hang these plants when we cut them down

580
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,620
the first thing I talked about was the

581
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,779
space how are you going to hang these if

582
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,399
you use your grow tent it's already got

583
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,899
those bars in the ceiling that are

584
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,580
holding it up and the bars that come to

585
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,320
hold up the uh the carbon filter and the

586
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,480
light you can just hang the coat hangers

587
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,099
from there if you don't have that what

588
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,259
you're gonna do something I can

589
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,939
recommend is get those eye hooks that

590
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,440
screw into the wall and of course don't

591
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,820
do this in like the living room do this

592
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,440
in the work shed do this in the garage

593
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,359
do this in the basement do this

594
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,160
somewhere like that use little eye hooks

595
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,599
screw them into the wall then walk

596
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,279
across the room and at the same height

597
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,740
put another eye hook in the wall over

598
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,819
there then use a piece of you can use a

599
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,919
lot of different things I've seen

600
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:00,659
fishing line used I've seen twine used

601
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,919
make sure it is very strong because

602
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,200
you're going to hang more than you

603
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
anticipate but just run some sort of a

604
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,160
line from one end of the room and string

605
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,599
up as many lines as you need and hang

606
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,640
those plants on there but let's start

607
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,678
thinking about it now before you're

608
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,000
cutting down plants and then you go oh

609
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,559
[Â __Â ] where am I going to hang these

610
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,538
because that's what a lot of people do

611
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,639
that's what a lot of Stoners do that's

612
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:23,220
what a lot of Growers do let's be ahead

613
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,559
of the curve let's set ourselves up for

614
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,179
success and be ready for this upcoming

615
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,918
Harvest now I've covered the main

616
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,780
supplies that we need for a successful

617
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,640
Harvest let's talk about a couple of

618
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,579
small details that will make this

619
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,900
Harvest better comfortable chairs are

620
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,819
very important you're going to be at

621
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,620
this for several hours I don't know how

622
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:42,418
many plants you've got I don't know how

623
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,279
well you did but hopefully you're going

624
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,080
to be trimming for several days I heard

625
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,178
somebody today say that they will be

626
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,399
trimming until Christmas they're going

627
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,259
to chop down around Halloween and they

628
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
will be trimming until Christmas imagine

629
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,640
how much ganja that is imagine how many

630
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,140
hours of sitting in a chair with

631
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,660
scissors in your hand looking down at

632
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,880
some buds imagine how much time that is

633
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,980
think about a comfortable chair I don't

634
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,480
know what you consider a comfy chair I'm

635
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,000
sitting up in a higher bar stool type

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,319
chair right now it makes me sit with a

637
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,538
straighter back and kind of gives me

638
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,918
forced better posture that would be a

639
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,000
good chart for me to trim in of course

640
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,400
then I'm going to get tired and want to

641
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,259
lean back but consider what you like as

642
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,298
a comfortable chair also be considerate

643
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,220
to your trim crew if you invite people

644
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:24,779
over don't give them a five gallon

645
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,819
bucket to sit on don't expect them to

646
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,740
trim your weed while they sit on a crate

647
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,240
give them a comfortable chair give them

648
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,038
a pillow to put on that chair if they

649
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,019
need to think about the people you've

650
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,819
got coming some of you young guys can

651
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,158
trim all [Â __Â ] night with no problems

652
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,079
my back gets sore right about here my

653
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,700
nickel gets sore right about here I've

654
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,699
got to think about how to keep that neck

655
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,500
and back in shape I recommend taking a

656
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,360
lot of breaks I know that sounds like

657
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,279
laziness but you got to get up you gotta

658
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,959
stretch that any other job you're

659
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,940
required to take a break every two hours

660
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,798
take a break for every two hours you

661
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,538
don't want a repetitive stress injury so

662
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:59,038
make sure you set a timer set on put on

663
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:01,259
a podcast or something at the end of

664
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,538
every podcast make sure you in the work

665
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,119
crew stand up stretch your wrists do a

666
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,200
couple of different wrists stretches

667
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,000
wiggle your arms put your hands above

668
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,100
your head get some some Wiggles going on

669
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,538
hold your hands low get some Wiggles get

670
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,759
some blood flow into places the blood

671
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,740
hasn't been in a little while uh maybe

672
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,839
go outside look at the sunshine go look

673
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,940
at a tree go see what outside looks like

674
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,678
if you've been inside go outside or if

675
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,419
you've been outside go inside change

676
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,640
environments get a different view for a

677
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,140
little while uh maybe go outside with

678
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,179
all your friends and smoke a joint get

679
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,559
away from the trim table take the crew

680
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,940
out there and smoke a joint for 10

681
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,678
minutes and don't talk about trimming

682
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,240
don't talk about the plants that will

683
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,620
buy you a lot of time I know it sounds

684
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,500
silly but when you're going to be

685
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,599
trimming for up until Christmas good

686
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,339
scheduled breaks and a good disciplined

687
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,319
break in a routine will definitely help

688
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:47,699
you out so make sure your trim crew is

689
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,639
comfortable make sure you guys take good

690
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,740
breaks and stay motivated stay fun how

691
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,900
can we do that if you are the guy the

692
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,960
gal the person in charge of hiring a

693
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,538
trim crew it is also good Customs to

694
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,220
provide drinks and snacks you also got

695
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:03,119
to pay the trim crew some way I don't

696
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,919
know how you're going to do that that's

697
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,479
up to you if they're friends they'll

698
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,980
come do it for free if you want to

699
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
compensate them you can give them weed

700
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,880
you can give them money give them

701
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,860
edibles but definitely feed them while

702
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,720
they're they're working for you keep in

703
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,298
mind a lot of us are vegan vegetarian

704
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,339

705
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:21,960

707
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,900
for while you're trimming and that way

708
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,460
you can get people some good snacks some

709

710

water around take care of your people

711
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,298
what else can we talk about podcasts and

712
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,340
or music have some sort of entertainment

713
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:37,500
going if it's just you trimming by

714
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,178
yourself put on whatever you like I you

715
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,339
can [Â __Â ] judge on your own decide for

716
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,380
yourself listen to what you enjoy but if

717
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,240
you've got a crew like if Mike was here

718
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,740
I wouldn't play Fish all night I may

719
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,940
play some fish but if Mike's here

720
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,400
trimming he's not going to listen to

721
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,538
seven hours of fish uh if Mike is here

722
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,759
we're not going to listen to Legion of

723
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:56,038
skanks podcast back to back like I would

724
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,500
if I was by myself be considerate of

725
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,140
your trim crew keep them motivated make

726
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,058
them like you if I brought my makeover

727
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,159
and we trimmed for six hours and I

728
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,599
played fish and Sublime all day he will

729
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,460
not come back tomorrow we got to

730
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,558
consider think about your trim crew they

731
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,900
do not have to come trim for you so make

732
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,940
sure you keep them happy fed and

733
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,559
comfortable make it a fun experience a

734
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,659
lot of people say the phrase trim jail

735
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,178
and maybe I'm a stickler but that

736
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,039
bothers me there are people in jail that

737
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,659
are dealing with some [Â __Â ] if you're

738
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:25,859
trimming you're not in jail bro you're

739
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,020
sitting at the table with your friends

740
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:30,538
listening to Sublime eating [Â __Â ]

741
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,158
snacks possibly on Discord chatting it

742
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,779
up with us so I don't really like it

743
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,400
when you guys call it trim jail because

744
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,899
there are people in jail that don't get

745
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
to do [Â __Â ] all day they're dealing with

746
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,380
some [Â __Â ] and we're sitting at the table

747
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
listening to Sublime drinking kombucha

748
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,100
and expensive bottled water and a nice

749
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,298
air-conditioned environment with all of

750
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,459
our friends and nothing to worry about

751
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,019
so trim jail does sound kind of weird

752
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,880
alright ladies and gentlemen boys and

753
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,279
