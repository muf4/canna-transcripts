about I got to harvest part of the

102
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,900
greenhouse if you've been following

103
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,340
along you know that I've been breeding

104
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,780
in a greenhouse this year that's right

105
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,400
we've got a greenhouse we do not talk

106
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,080
about the location nobody knows a lot

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,340
about it try to keep it secretive

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
because that's just [ __ ] that I've

109
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,299
learned along the way anyway I'm ready

110
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
to tell you about it now because it has

111
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,780
been harvested the plants are down they

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,459
are in bins they are drying they're

113
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,080
secure so now that those plants have

114
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,819
been harvested they're in a secure place

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,980
I do feel much more comfortable talking

116
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,979
about them let's talk talk a little bit

117
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,079
about what we bred this summer I did use

118
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,000
a Jack the Ripper mail I'm sure you've

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,560
if you've been following along you know

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,719
that I do have a Jack the Ripper mail

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,938
that I really enjoy the way that he

122
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,560
works I'm very fond of the outcome that

123
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,599
comes from that Jack the Ripper male he

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,040
made the blueberry butcher uh he made

125
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,260
the convergence he made the Jack the

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,360
Ripper f2s he's made a lot of great

127
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,339
things he made the dog Ripper uh there's

128
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,960
a lot of great stuff coming from him so

129
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,418
I took that Jack the Ripper mail and I

130
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,879
put him outside and I pollinated 10

131
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,978
females in Colorado in a grow space here

132
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,360
you were allowed up to 12 plants in most

133
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,699
areas if you have six of your

134
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,319
recreational plants six medical plants

135
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,540
that's your limit we put 12 plants

136
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,279
outdoors I put two clones of the Jack

137
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,199
the Ripper mail out there the same male

138
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,478
just two copies of him to make sure to

139
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,460
get plenty of pollen then we put 10

140
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,099
female plants out there we pollinated

141
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,899
all 10 of them very thoroughly

142
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,040
um let's talk a little bit about the

143
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,319
plants that were out there I've got to

144
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,600
leave some to the imagination I did make

145
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,459
more blueberry butcher seeds out there

146
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,020
so there will be more blueberry butcher

147
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,799
seeds coming very soon those were made

148
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:11,159
in the greenhouse this year I did cross

149
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,079
the uh the Congo the Roberts Creek Congo

150
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,300
the vision maker Congo has been

151
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,060
pollinated by the Jack the Ripper that

152
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,418
should make some uh extremely potent

153
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,699
really sativa dominant uh head Buzz uh

154
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,680
kind of paranoia panic attack euphoric

155
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,080
talk too much kind of weed that's really

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,879
what I expect from that the Congo did

157
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,740
not like being outdoors or in the

158
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,259
greenhouse in Colorado it did not react

159
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,939
as well as it does indoors indoors that

160
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,939
plant gets taller than everybody super

161
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,800
quickly it's a monstrous plant when I

162
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,060
put it Outdoors it kind of stalled out

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,439
it was like nah I don't think I'm gonna

164
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,660
grow like I normally do which was

165
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,978
disappointing but we still got plenty of

166
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,900
seeds from that one there are a lot of

167
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,758
seeds to play with a lot of seeds to

168
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,339
sift through you guys will have fun with

169
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,560
that also I pollinated once again I made

170
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,000
more of the Platinum tanji 2 Jack the

171
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,280
Ripper I made that a little bit ago we

172
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,019
made a very small plant to play with ran

173
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,939
a few testers we saw great success with

174
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,698
that so I did make a whole batch of

175
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,860
platinum Tangy 2 Jack the Ripper I also

176
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,020
had a Golden Goat pollinated by Jack the

177
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,259
Ripper and that Golden Goat produced a

178
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,060
lot of seeds that Golden Goat plant did

179
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,100
amazingly well Outdoors the Platinum

180
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,918
Tangy and the Golden Goat both did very

181
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,680
very well outdoors I made more Jack the

182
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,299
Ripper F2 seeds I'm not sure how much

183
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,418
else I want to tell you about I

184
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,379
pollinated the p91 with Jack the Ripper

185
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:30,299
um that's all we're going to talk about

186
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,038
for now but I made a bunch of great

187
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,680
stuff with the Jack the Ripper Outdoors

188
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,478
the plants are cut down it takes about

189
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,100
depending on the environment the room

190
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,379
and honestly how often I get to mess

191
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,600
with me it it takes about 10 to 14 days

192
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,219
for those plants to dry I let them dry

193
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,199
really really dry

194
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,360
once they're super bone dry and crispy

195
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,919
I'll remove all the stems and then I'll

196
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,840
start crushing it up with my hands and

197
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,279
gloves and just crunching it up into a

198
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,418
basically a fine dust it looks like

199
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,459
you're just going to roll a big old

200
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,978
fatty or a bunch of blunts I've got an

201
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,019
entire eight foot tall Plant worth of

202
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,120
material just in a bin and I just crush

203
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,560
it up until it's dust with my gloves and

204
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,360
then I've got a machine that I pour that

205
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,418
material into and it actually separates

206
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,400
the material and the seeds so I've gotta

207
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,139
I need about 10 to 14 days to get it dry

208
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,000
a day or two to get it all crushed up

209
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,439
and then a day or two it takes me a

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,819
while to run all these plants is a lot

211
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,160
of material and a lot of plants to work

212
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,960
through to run that all through the the

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,699
separator then it's got to go all

214
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,038
through the counter then it's all got to

215
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,180
go out to testers so it's going to be a

216
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,098
little bit before a lot of this is

217
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,379
available I'm sure right now my tester

218
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,579
inbox is going to start blowing up ah

219
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,079
send them to me you guys if you know how

220
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,818

221
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,620
interested in testing send me a message

address when you do that it just makes

224
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,019
it so much easier send me all your

225
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,159
testing information if you want to test

226

the new [ __ ] that came out of the green

227
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
house a lot of it will get put in as

228

freebies in upcoming orders also so that

229
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,120
is my fall harvest report for 2022. I

230
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,859
feel like it was a great success we've

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,840
got a lot of seeds a lot of great

232
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,220
crosses big shout out to the people who

233
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,719
helped me out with the greenhouse space

234
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,699
the people that were out there early in

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,960
the morning sometimes late at night big

236
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,639
shout out to the person that had to hang

237
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,519
a light they did not expect to hang in a

238
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,560
high space in a precarious position

239
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,299
um big up you guys did a great job we

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160

241
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,280
year all right I do have more stuff to

242
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,840
talk about you may have noticed that my

243
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,579
content was a little bit weird on the

244
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,079
last couple of episodes I'm trying to

245
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,478
tread lightly

246
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,339
um YouTube is on uh they're basically on

247
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,500
the Rampage they're shutting down a lot

248
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,818
of the uh the Cannabis content the

249
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,978
Educators that are out here talking

250
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,800
about the plant the dude grow show has

251
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,479
been completely shut down uh newbie nugs

252
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
his page is completely gone a few of our

253
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
other friends have lost their YouTube

254
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,059
Pages simply for posting cannabis

255
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,099
talking about supporting condoning and

256
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,719
educating about our favorite plant or

257
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,879
least my favorite plant I'm sure it's

258
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,920
probably most of our favorite plant big

259
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,720
shout out to you monstera nerds but

260
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,000
YouTube has been on the Rampage taking

261
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,278
down content I've been trying to tread

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
lightly because I have gotten a couple

263
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,240
of YouTube strikes first they gave me a

264
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,800
warning then they gave me another strike

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
and they said he can't post for five

266
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,399
days and then they said if you get one

267
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,800
more strike this month we will take down

268
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,419
your channel so I try to not post for

269
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,059
the rest of that month so that I did not

270
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,799
get more strikes on Fresh content the

271
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:17,039
problem is that they are striking old

272
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,958
content I've got 770 episodes before

273
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,360
this episode and they keep finding

274
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,458
problems with old content like in the

275
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,740
hundreds like 100 200 300 they're

276
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,000
finding just random episodes flagging it

277
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,100
giving me

278
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,019
um Community violations for that for

279
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,360
some reason my content has been deemed

280
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,580
harmful and or dangerous which I don't

281
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,560
understand because I'm just sitting here

282
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,240
talking and unless my voice is that

283
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,399
powerful that I'm sparking some sort of

284
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Revolution we are not harmful or

285
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,700
dangerous I'm teaching people how to

286
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,940
help themselves with a medical product

287
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,060
to ease and improve the quality of their

288
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,860
life we can look at uh we can see half

289
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,259
naked women we could see beer ads and

290
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,879
boner pills all day but if you try to

291
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,799
promote the plant deal we love that's

292
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,899
harmful and dangerous

293
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,338
um I understand it but I don't agree

294
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,600
with it let's talk about this a little

295
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,800
bit I've got

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,360
um I've got a nice little rant that I'm

297
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,879
gonna I'm gonna just skip my notes here

298
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm gonna leave a note where I am and

299
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,879
then all right here we go I understand

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,740
this I've got a little rant that I've

301
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,419
kind of half done on a couple of other

302
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,419
podcasts but I wanted to save the big

303
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,039
part for this show here is what I feel

304
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,799
is going on with YouTube first of all

305
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,480
let me say I understand it but I do not

306
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,099
agree with it here's what I feel is

307
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,420
happening with YouTube this is just my

308
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,278
take on it

309
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't do any research so I don't have

310
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,559
an actual number YouTube is a billion

311
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,440
dollar company right definitely a

312
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,000
multi-million possibly a multi-billion

313
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,339
dollar company they do a lot of Revenue

314
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,080
they feed a lot of people they have a

315
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,579
lot of income a lot of interaction a lot

316
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,500
of support with the entire world

317
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,778
everybody on the planet knows what

318
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,759
YouTube is everybody has seen a YouTube

319
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,958
video if that's where I learn a lot of

320
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,240
things that's where I teach a lot of

321
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,219
things we all know YouTube so YouTube is

322
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,799
present YouTube is popular they've got a

323
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,959
lot of money the people that own and

324
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,639
work at YouTube like having a lot of

325
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,979
money they like knowing that paycheck is

326
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,019
coming in every month so now let's talk

327
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,300
about why they are messing with cannabis

328
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,179
content a lot of people say it's legal

329
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:15,719
in Colorado it's legal in California yes

330
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:18,179
but it's not legal in some other places

331
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,100
um so what would happen and I don't

332
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,259
agree with this but I'm just speaking on

333
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,700
General why I feel like this is

334
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,259
happening this is just my understanding

335
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,459
to make it sort of an explanation of

336
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,720
this

337
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,159
um they make a lot of money they they

338
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,940
don't want to get involved in any sort

339
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,799
of legal battle court case anything that

340
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,660
would tarnish their income anything that

341
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,458
would tarnish their reputation anything

342
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:41,879
that would tarnish their revenue Stream

343
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:44,699
So hypothetically this could work this

344
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,039
way if somebody were to learn something

345
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,200
illegal off of YouTube and they practice

346
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,539
that illegal practice and got in trouble

347
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,360
for it and they said I learned it on

348
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,399
YouTube guess who could be involved in

349
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,959
be part of it they could be an accessory

350
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,059
they could be implemented in that crime

351
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,039
because that person may not have

352
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,659
committed that crime without the help of

353
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,399
YouTube and YouTube doesn't want that

354
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,078
YouTube doesn't want to go to court

355
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,578
YouTube doesn't want the press for that

356
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,620
YouTube doesn't want to be involved in

357
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,778
that I can't speak for YouTube but I am

358
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,759
a company owner I have a company I've

359
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,519
got a Discord server

360
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,559
um I believe in free speech I definitely

361
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,720
believe that we should be able to say

362
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,059
what we want to say I also believe that

363
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,459
there will be repercussions and

364
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,018
consequences for what I say if I say

365
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,000
something completely Terror terrible to

366
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,440
somebody I wouldn't be too surprised if

367
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
they punched me right in the [ __ ]

368
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
mouth that's how life goes we've got

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,259
freedom of speech but we've also got

370
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,479
expectation of consequences uh

371
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,338
responsibility of words and action like

372
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,720
that is part of being a human let me get

373
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,940
myself back on track here so I do

374
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,100
believe in freedom of speech you cannot

375
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,579

Discord server I will not allow that

380

391
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,879

395
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,879
r word in the wrong way I'm going to say

396

408
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,059
condone that it's not what I'm here for

409
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
and if you're gonna say that you're not

410
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:54,179
part of our team you're not here for

411
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,560
what we're trying to do and you should

412
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,059
go play over there when you get your

413
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,559
[ __ ] figured out come back we may let

414
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,479
you hang out but when you're acting like

415
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,759
that we don't want you around so on my

416
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,399
server I do practice censorship and it

417
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,899
is because I don't want [ __ ] I don't

418
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,299
want terroristic activities I don't want

419
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,759
racism I don't want homophobia on my

420
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,259
Discord server I barely make any money

421
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,299
compared to YouTube I've got a business

422
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,419
that does generate Revenue but compared

423
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,919
to YouTube I am nobody I've got 10 000

424
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,078
YouTube subscribers YouTube's got

425
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,139
however many people watch all day every

426
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,939
day imagine the money that YouTube is

427
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,940
bringing in and imagine why they don't

428
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,399
want to to give any of that to core law

429
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,320
enforcement or anything like that now

430
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,899
think about this really does sound crazy

431
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
but think about if two people are in an

432
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,139
alley and one person says hey can you

433
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,759
find drugs and the other guy says I

434
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,940
don't have drugs but person number three

435
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,559
has drugs if one of those persons gets

436
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,959
caught selling or buying or carrying

437
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,278
those drugs and it goes down wrong all

438
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,018
three of those people are going to jail

439
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,778
for that drug transaction because person

440
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,940
two facilitated that transaction YouTube

441
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:58,379
doesn't want to be person two that is

442
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,060
basically what's happening I'm trying to

443
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,860
be careful with what I say here because

444
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,958
here's where I'm headed to this I don't

445
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,759
want to lose my YouTube channel for

446
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,559
saying something stupid I'm probably

447
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,120
risking a lot by talking about YouTube

448
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,458
and censorship the way that I am right

449
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,159
now but that's part of my job is to

450
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,299
[ __ ] speak up we're I'm ganja soldier

451
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,379
I've been here doing this for so long

452
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,359

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,420
there was something in there that they

470
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,879
needed and they were not stopping

471
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:56,278
digging and destroying my house until

472
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,139
they found that [ __ ] so nowadays when

473
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,480

my life and find somewhere new to live

479
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,300

landlord kicks you out you don't get to

484
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,698

00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,599
um yeah I'm I'm okay with losing my

487
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,278
Instagram I'm okay with losing my

488
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,320
YouTube knock on wood I don't want to

489
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,120
lose them but there are other options

490
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,100
other places to go if stuff like that

491
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,899
does happen I am going to find other

492
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,120
places to upload the videos I've been

493
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,759
told that cannabis does support podcast

494
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,500
videos soon I will be posting my videos

495
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,059
to cannibals it takes a long time to

496
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,179
upload those videos you guys be patient

497
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,500
with me I'm also going to try Vimeo and

498
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:45,059
there was another service I think it's

499
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,578
called Rumble I'm also going to try

500
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:51,059
those so if I disappear on YouTube look

501
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:53,278
for me on Vimeo Rumble and also on

502
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,138
cannabis and the audio platform will

503
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,578
always remain because the RSS feeds are

504
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,320
cool they don't they don't even censor

505
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,479
very much on those

506
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,699
um platforms all right let me get back

507
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,558
on track I look forward to legalization

508
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,659
so that we don't have to be censored I

509
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,399
look forward to all of the entire nation

510
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,640
legalizing cannabis so that I can teach

511
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,380
everybody without fear of my show my

512
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,660
hard work my dedication part of my

513
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,880
income being hindered because YouTube

514
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,199
has some silly rules I get it but I do

515
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,120
not agree YouTube

516
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,620

of the loop because I'm so busy creating

526
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,960
content and trying to get it out that I

527
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:44,699

the new platform so if you've got a

529

549
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,538
seeds that I can offer you I'm not going

550
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,480
anywhere even if YouTube shuts me down

551
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,038
if YouTube Vimeo Rumble cannabuzz if

552
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,900
they all shut me down bro we'll invent

553
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,640
our own [ __ ] we'll come back stronger

554
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,059
than ever you can't stop us can't stop

555
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,500
won't stop Viva La Revolution cannabis

556
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,899
can't be stopped bro we're legalizing

557
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,119
everywhere and if we do disappear it's

558
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,320
only going to be temporary because you

559
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,519
know that as soon as they do legalize

560
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,839
cannabis they're going to let all of us

561
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,819
come back and play but the question is

562
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,798
do we want to come back then if they

563
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,359
shut us all down do we even want to come

564
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,639
back to YouTube all right I think I've

565
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,079
rambled on long enough about this topic

566
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't even know if this episode will

567
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,798

568
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,240

569
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,918
