00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,439
did this thing and i was blown away

169
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,359
put it into my repertoire as a

170
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,879
professional drummer so i learned from

171
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,319
everybody i can learn something from

172
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,639
anybody on the planet some

173
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,079
everybody's got something to teach me so

174
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,960
i learned from you guys as much as you

175
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,478
learned from me

176
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
i need to learn to stay focused because

177
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,599
i'm rambly as as [ __ ] today anyway

178
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,439
um thank you bro for recognizing my hard

179
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
work and my dedication to this industry

180
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,319
this

181
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,599
community this craft this lifestyle bro

182
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,079
i'm [ __ ] in it to win it at this

183
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
point

184
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,359
i've got uh there's this is what i'm

185
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,319
doing so

186
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,038
anyway it says bro my question goes like

187
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,800
this

188
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,000
i have a white widow plant which i've

189
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,720
been growing for 20 plus years

190
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
i bet that's a badass plant dude uh old

191
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
school white widow was fire

192
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
and then if you've chosen to keep it

193
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,478
around for 20 years it has got

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
to be the heat that has got to be a gem

195
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,199
it says

196
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
i keep a mother plant and veg for around

197
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
six months to a year before taking

198
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,319
a couple healthy clones then sending her

199
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,918
into flour

200
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,240
ah that's what a lot of us do i keep a

201
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,680
mother plant around for about six months

202
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
and then i chop the mother plant do a

203
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
bunch of clones i flower out

204
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
the some of the clones and i keep one of

205
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
the really good ones but not the best of

206
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,959
course the best goes to the flower room

207
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,478
i keep one of the like the top three as

208
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,239
my new mother plant so i can just keep

209
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,639
refreshing that genetic

210
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
every three six usually about six months

211
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,439
sometimes nine months to a year

212
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,799
depending on how the plant grows

213
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,319
if it's the mac you only need to do it

214
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
once a year if it's a rise you got to do

215
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
it three times a year just depends on

216
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
the

217
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,759
speed of the plant so our friend has a

218
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,000
white widow plant they keep a mother

219
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,720
plant

220
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,279
they cut some clones send it to flower

221
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
and then

222
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,119
they keep the mother plant around now

223
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
the question is would it be possible and

224
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
actually type

225
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,680
is it be possible and i like that is it

226
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
be possible to make seeds of her

227
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,879
to keep her around instead of always

228
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,239
keeping a mom plant around

229
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,079
taking up space so our friend does not

230
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
want to keep the mother plant around and

231
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,240
they want to make some seeds of this

232
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
plant

233
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
so the mother plant is not always taking

234
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,039
up space the first thing i would

235
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
recommend is just little tiny bonsai

236
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,598
mother plant

237
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,879
cut a clone as soon as it gets too big

238
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,159
cut a clone of that as soon as it gets

239
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
too big cut a clone of that just always

240
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,039
have a little tiny one

241
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,038
a little tiny tiny mother plant would be

242
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,399
an option but that's not what you asked

243
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
you asked about seeds

244
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,120
yes it would be very possible very

245
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
viable to make seeds of this plant

246
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
i would just make s-ones self-seeds

247
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,478
we'll talk more in detail about that in

248
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
a minute i wanna wrap up the letter

249
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,959
and then i'll get myself on a good rant

250
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,719
talking about making seeds of this plant

251
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,638
um would you recommend going this route

252
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
by making seeds of this pheno

253
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,240
or just keep doing it the way i have

254
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
been doing it bro your way works

255
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,720
uh you don't have to keep a mother plant

256
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,399
you can have a large veg plant going

257
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
and as soon as you put it into flower

258
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,000
cut a clone of it and then let that one

259
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
keep growing as the next veg plant

260
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,839
you never have a mother plant per se but

261
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
you've always got a healthy plant and

262
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,079
veg that you can get a clone from

263
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,359
and then maybe wait seven to ten days

264
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,399
before you flip it to make sure you're

265
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
gonna get a clone

266
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,598
and then maybe take too many clones just

267
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,878
i don't know your clone skill but you

268
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,918
don't have to keep another plant you can

269
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,080
have a veg plant

270
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,120
that is a clone donor as well and then

271
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,639
flour and then

272
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
keep doing that you have one that is a

273
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,598
veg plant that goes into flower one's a

274
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
veg plant it goes into flower

275
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,439
you can do that but that's a really easy

276
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
process

277
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,240
you want to think about making seeds

278
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,519
that's the part where i'm going to focus

279
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
because i'm known as being a seed

280
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
breeder

281
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
i think the keeping a veg plant and not

282
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
having a mother plant i think you can

283
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,919
understand how to move that into the

284
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
process just take the mother plant

285
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,799
you've got

286
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
consider that a veg plan when it's time

287
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,079
to get clones take three

288
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
five ten clones from it flower it i

289
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,519
think that's what you're doing so

290
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,519
uh you figured out that process let's

291
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,318
talk about making seeds because that is

292
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,959
where

293
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
my area of expertise does lie he does

294
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,079
wrap it up with thanks ross to jeff

295
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,598
hey thank you all mixed up i appreciate

296
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,959
the feedback the input and the great

297
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,200
question here

298
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,079
here is my answer if you want to make uh

299
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,158
preservation

300
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
seeds of this uh strain so that you've

301
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,639
got it forever this is what i would do

302
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
and this would work for uh maybe you

303
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,199
just don't want to keep this strain

304
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
around maybe you've got it maybe you

305
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
want to go on vacation and simply just

306
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
not grow for a minute but you want to

307
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,519
come back and have a reliable stock of

308
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,360
something to work with

309
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,200
ah maybe you just want to move and you

310
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
can't move the plants with you or

311
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
however you want to preserve this

312
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
forever in seed form this is how i would

313
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
do it

314
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,120
um i would reverse the plant to keep it

315
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
pure

316
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,480
and use that plant as the pollen donor

317
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
and the female plant the pollen receiver

318
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,159
that way we're not adulterating it

319
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
for this to happen you've got to make

320
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,958
feminized s1

321
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,519
self seeds so you're going to cut one

322
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,599
clone

323
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,278
and that will be selected as your pollen

324
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,639
donor it's a female right now but we're

325
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:21,200
going to make it give you pollen don't

326
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,720
worry

327
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
then i would cut two or three other

328
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,278
clones those will be the pollen

329
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,039
receivers that you're

330
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,240
that are going to make use seeds uh

331
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,439
they'll receive the pollen the seeds

332
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
will come from them

333
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
so you've got your pollen giver it they

334
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,278
all look the same right now they're all

335
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
clones of that white widow plant they

336
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,000
all look the same but

337
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
we're going to take one and we're going

338
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,559
to treat it with silver thiosulfate

339
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
i've done a full episode on silver

340
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,719
thiosulfate i've done a full episode on

341
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,800
making feminized seeds

342
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
with those two episodes together you

343
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
should be able to

344
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
get at least a good head start a good

345
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
blueprint on how to make fem seeds you

346
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
may need to

347
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,278
hit me up for details questions maybe

348
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,480
search the internet for some fine detail

349
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,320
some fine tuning

350
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,240
but i think with what i gave you you

351
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
should be able to make uh you should be

352
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
able to find and make the silver

353
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,319
thiosulfate then you should be

354
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
able to execute the process of reversing

355
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
the plant

356
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,240
pollinating the pollen receiver plants

357
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,120
and creating seeds out of that

358
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
i know who you are uh i know you listen

359
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
well

360
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,359
and i know you can do this i know you've

361
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,799
got the knowledge already from listening

362
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
to the show to do this

363
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,799
so i would reverse it that way you keep

364
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
it pure that way when you come back to

365
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,759
these seeds

366
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
it is unadulterated it is just your

367
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,039
white widow plant

368
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,360
any other way of crossing this plant to

369
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
make seeds would adulterate it

370
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
if you took another male plant and

371
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,039
pollinated that female

372
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
you're making a new f1 cross it's going

373
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,319
to be

374
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,399
something white widow to arise white

375
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,879
widow 2 strawberry starburst white widow

376
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
to

377
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,399
whatever other male plant you used so

378
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,679
when you grow it it's not going to be

379
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,240
your white widow it's going to be

380
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:00,000
adulterated excuse the kombucha burps

381
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
anyway i would reverse it that way

382
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
you're keeping it pure it is still white

383
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,760
widow you're going to find

384
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,000
a little bit of phenotypical variation

385
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,480
but within five or six seeds maybe 10

386
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
seeds

387
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,079
you'll definitely find that phenotype

388
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
that looks just like the one you started

389
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,799
with that you reversed

390
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
so uh cut two or more clones uh you're

391
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,359
going to need one as a paul and donor

392
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,078
one is a paul and receiver i would in my

393
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
scenario

394
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,919
i would do two or three as the pollen

395
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,919
giver and like six as the receiver

396
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,199
because i would reverse the other three

397
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,519
at different spray

398
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
intervals and ratios to learn that plant

399
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
and then i don't know how well the

400
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,958
others are going to receive pollen i

401
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
would make sure

402
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,559
that i got enough plants to receive

403
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,319
pollen i'm just extra careful when it

404
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,399
comes to reversing and pollinating

405
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
that's also my career so i got to rely

406
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,879
on that

407
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,479
so cut two or more clones reverse one

408
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,120
like i said before you've got the

409
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
knowledge

410
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,839
in your head already from listening to

411
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,838
my show how to make silver thiosulfate

412
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
how and when to apply it to the plant

413
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,279
how to [ __ ] make that plant create

414
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
pollen sacks and put that pollen

415
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,799
on the girls you know how to do that if

416
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
you don't message me i'll get you

417
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,958
through it

418
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,159
so reverse one plant pollinate one or

419
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,638
more and then wait

420
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
all you gotta do is wait uh then harvest

421
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,200
the seeds then

422
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,879
store those seeds they should be nice

423
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,480
and hard and tiger striped or at least

424
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,039
dark brown when you pull them out

425
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
let them dry really hard then store them

426
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,599
with all of your other seeds well

427
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,399
labeled and guess what

428
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
you've now got reserve stock of your

429
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
white widow and they're feminized also

430
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,679
so you're not going to find boys in

431
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,720
there

432
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,159
so that's going to help you out but

433
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
you're not able to breed with that

434
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,159
unless you do more reversals or find a

435
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,200
different male it can't be a male

436
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,399
for breeding i'm going to press pause

437
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
take a drink and catch my breath and

438
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
we'll wrap this question up and move

439
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,239
forward

440
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
all right i am back i'm well hydrated

441
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
i'm well medicated i'm ready to ramble

442
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,559
on i think i pretty much answered this

443
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,879
question about preservation

444
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,759
uh cut a few clones reverse one uh

445
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,919
pollinate

446
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,120
make seeds harvest the seeds dry them

447
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,519
and store them and then when it comes

448
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
time

449
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,560
to grow this again you have got it

450
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,000
the hardest part about this project in

451
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,439
my opinion

452
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,759
and many people are probably going to

453
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,800
agree with me is cutting down

454
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,720
the plant you've kept for 20 years

455
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,479
making fem seeds out of it that's just a

456
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
process that's a standard operating

457
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
procedure

458
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
cutting down a plant that you've been

459
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
attached to for 20 years is going to

460
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,839
feel strange inside

461
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,759
if it wasn't before now that i've

462
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,800
mentioned it it is certainly going to

463
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,200
make you feel

464
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,159
some type of way that's the part that's

465
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
going to be the real challenge here

466
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,078
there's no sop

467
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,480
for detachment for cutting down a plant

468
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,599
you've been in love with for 20 years

469
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
i recently let go of my flow plant there

470
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
was nothing wrong with flow i had flow

471
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,120
for

472
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,078
12 years 13 years i honestly just got

473
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,159
bored with it

474
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,919
i bred to it i grew it i smoke it i bred

475
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,278
it to everything

476
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,958
and it was a great plant but it just

477
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,519
wasn't i don't know it was like a seven

478
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,919
out of a ten and i like elevens

479
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
so it had to go but that plant was

480
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,958
around

481
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
through my evolution as a grower as a

482
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,078
breeder

483
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,958
as like uh a basement buccaneer to a

484
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,078
commercial grower that flow was around

485
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,319
that float paid

486
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,679
a lot of bills that flow paid a lot of

487
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
favors that flow

488
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,000
paved a lot of ways i would wake up and

489
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
smell that plant and it would make me

490
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
nauseous because i had been around it

491
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
grew it smelled it smoked it sold it for

492
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,278
so long

493
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
that it had to go so maybe you're done

494
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,039
with this white widow but obviously

495
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,638
you're not

496
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,919
done done it's like a girl you want to

497
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,440
break up with but you still keep her

498
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,078
number in your phone you're like i ain't

499
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
done yet

500
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,278
making these femme seeds out of her

501
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
anyway i'm rambling but the hardest part

502
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,399
is going to be getting rid of this plant

503
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,159
dude you can make all the seeds you want

504
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,198
cut all the clones you want good luck

505
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,240
when it's time to cut it down you're

506
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,639
getting it shaky

507
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,759
it's going to be fun make a video make a

508
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
video when you do it

509
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,480
bro thank you for the great message that

510
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600

514
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,159
know you're a smart person

515
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839

i need to keep moving because i'm awful

525
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,958
rambly on this podcast

526
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
this message came from patreon

527
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,679
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

528
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,759
heart

529
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,039
it is from our friend sticky randy and

530
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,480
it goes a lot

531
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,159
like this it says hey ross to jeff

532
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
here's a good question for you what kind

533
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,600
of notes

534
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,479
should i take while doing a breeding

535
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,920
phenohunt

536
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
for males and female plants um that's a

537
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,559
really good question

538
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,320
and honestly it's kind of up to you i

539
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,198
mean that's a very vague shitty answer

540
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
but what are you

541
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,799
interested in what do you care about the

542
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
main things i look for

543
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,399
are germination ratios i'm not sure if

544
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,159
you're asking me like

545
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,839
uh you're doing a breeding pheno hunt

546
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,240
for males and females

547
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
so are you looking for males to use in

548
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,198
the breeding

549
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,198
like i'm not sure what exactly you're

550
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,519
asking but for notes for taking

551
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,719
i always take like notes on germination

552
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
rates how many

553
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
sprouts throw 100 seeds in a paper towel

554
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
and see how many of them pop write that

555
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,240
down

556
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,240
that's my germination ratio it's a

557
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
really easy number to get uh it's a real

558
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,799
easy number to math up it's a really

559
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,239
good number to have

560
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,958
so that's where i start germination

561
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,879
ratios then ah how many of those

562
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,638
made it out of the dirt how many of them

563
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,799
were males and females how many looked

564
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,399
like [ __ ] how many were vigorous

565
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,000
all of my plants are labeled with a

566
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,559
number and or a letter

567
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,278
uh if something stands out any sort of

568
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,838
anomaly

569
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,919
gets written down anything you notice

570
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,519
gets written down that's how i do it

571
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,439
i don't know what you're interested in

572
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,639
as a breeder i want to see growth

573
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,040
structure

574
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
at certain times how it responds to

575
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,838
certain things i do to it

576
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,159
um if i fed it recharged did it over

577
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
get to absorb too much nitrogen because

578
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,439
sometimes if you feed it

579
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,399
too much recharge it'll make it cycle

580
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
too quickly

581
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,559
uh when i gave it calmag did the leaves

582
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
get real serrated or did it start to get

583
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,159
pale on me because i overfed

584
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,679
it um i write down notes like that

585
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,198
things that i notice

586
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,679
i write down every feed everything i mix

587
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,319
up

588
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,838
so if i've got a 25 gallon i will say a

589
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
20 gallon reservoir it's easier to do

590
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,959
math

591
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,078
uh if i do a 20 gallon reservoir i write

592
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,679
down that i put

593
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,279
uh 60 mils of this product in there 120

594
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,280
mils of this product in there

595
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,038
10 mils of this product in there and i

596
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,959
write down as i pour it in i just it's a

597
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,798
google document honestly in my phone

598
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
so i just open it up and i type 60 i

599
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,359
pour in 60 then go to the next product

600
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
type in equinox 120 pour in the 120 of

601
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,958
equinox

602
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,798
74 grams of shine and that's just a

603
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,160
[ __ ] wild exaggeration i'm just

604
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,918
making up numbers now but

605
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,279
put a bunch of shine in there stir it up

606
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,520
then guess what i do next

607
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,440
i measure the ph i measure the ec guess

608
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,558
what i do then i write those down in a

609
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,558
google document

610
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,918
i've got google documents for the ph the

611
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,240
ec the feed

612
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,240
and the runoff uh in and out for the

613
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,319
past [ __ ] six years of my grow

614
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,759
so if i come up with any issues scroll

615
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,119
through i've got a good guideline of

616
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,079
what might have happened so those are

617
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,479
notes i take

618
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,319
you're asking about breeding ah

619
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
internodal structure how far apart are

620
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,558
the nodes

621
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,839
do you have like a criteria in your head

622
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,240
that you say

623
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,678
these branches are squatty these

624
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,759
branches are sturdy

625
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,440
these branches are stretchy these

626
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,359
branches are twisty

627
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
ah this plant has a christmas tree

628
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,240
structure this plant has a fern-like

629
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
stretch

630
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,160
like do you have something even if it's

631
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,480
just a guideline or a

632
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,400
bracket system in your own head do you

633
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
have something like that to compare the

634
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,798
plants to

635
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,719
in your own head so whatever you find

636
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,038
important is what's important for your

637
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,519
grow notes what are you looking for

638
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,798
obviously structure appearance leaf size

639
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,839
leaf shape

640
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,558
germination rates growth rates ah

641
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,879
aroma rub the stems give it a smell rub

642
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,639
the leaves give it a smell

643
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,559
are the leaves perking up or the leaves

644
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,960
drooping are there

645
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,319
10 plants in the room and one of them is

646
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
doing something different

647
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,359
write that down whatever that one plant

648
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
is doing write it down

649
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,798
also stand near that plant and look

650
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,558
around

651
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,160
is the air conditioner blowing on that

652
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,678
plant is the heater blowing on that

653
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,160
plant is the humidifier

654
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,919
extra humidifying that plant is it right

655
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
under one of the lights is it right

656
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,160
far away from one of the lights that's

657
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
the [ __ ] i write down because

658
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,759
the scientific method requires all of

659
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,360
the data we can get

660
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,798
if you say um i've got 10 plants and

661
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,319
this one over here is growing real tall

662
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,918
that must be the best plant

663
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,159
what if the light's right there and we

664
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
don't know that and we pick that plant

665
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,519
and we take that plant to our facility

666
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,319
and fill the entire facility with that

667
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,839
one plant

668
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,918
and it doesn't perform the way it did in

669
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,519
that one situation because it was

670
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,120
right next to the [ __ ] light or it

671
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,759
was right by the heater and it loved

672
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,119
that heat

673
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,038
and we don't know that that one plant

674
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,199
got the heater so there's no scientific

675
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,720
method to that unless you write down

676
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,038
every detail that you can see ah also

677
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,880
details we cannot see humidity

678
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,119
temperature vpd

679
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
uh anything you can think of write all

680
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,678
of that [ __ ] down

681
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,440
in a commercial environment one of the

682
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
things i like the guys to do guys and

683
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
gals now there are lots of lovely

684
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
excellent ladies working in the

685
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,640
commercial facilities

686
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,520
when you walk in and out of a commercial

687
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
grow room i have you write down the vpd

688
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,960
the temperature and humidity on a little

689
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,759
chart just it gives us

690
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,200
accountability also makes you look that

691
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,079
way you walk in the room you check the

692
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,759
meters

693
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,359
sometimes you get complacent and a

694
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,000
growth sometimes the staff is busy

695
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,639
thinking about

696
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
task a and they get color blind or they

697
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
get the blinders on what's it called

698
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,520
tunnel vision is the word i'm looking

699
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,519
for

700
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,639
and they can't focus so they just walk

701
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,240
right in there and

702
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,679
they don't realize that the room is

703
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,279
super humid because they're

704
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,640
going in there just to find that pair of

705
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,240
scissors at the end of that hallway at

706
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
the end of that [ __ ] grow table

707
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
and they don't realize it's super humid

708
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,679
so when they walk in there every time

709
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
they gotta look at the monitor write

710
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,880
down the vpd the temperature and the

711
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,200
humidity and initial it

712
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
and that way i know the last time mitt

713
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
mark came in here mark is a made-up name

714
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,158
don't yell at mark for [ __ ] up

715
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,839
the last time mark came in here he

716
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
looked at the vpd and it was cool that

717
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,240
was two hours ago

718
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
i'm in here it's [ __ ] up something

719
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
happened in the last hour and a half we

720
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,319
got to figure out

721
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
go look at the cameras go look at the

722
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,359
charts look at the plants figure out

723
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
what went wrong in the room

724
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,558
is the dehumidifier broken is the air

725
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,240
conditioner stuck on is

726
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,519
one of the blowers in the room stuck

727
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
somewhere that's when we started

728
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,960
investigating so

729
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,360
every little detail make notes that way

730
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,919
you can find the problems

731
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,199
every it's like a murder investigation

732
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,960
the more [ __ ] you know

733
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
the easier it is to solve the crime and

734
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,279
a lot of times when you find a problem

735
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,279
in the grow

736
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,960
it's like a big ol who done it do we

737
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,279
have spider mites is it too cold in here

738
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,720
is it too hot in here how's the vpd

739
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,319
all of that shit's gonna go through your

740
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
mind the minute you see an issue in the

741
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,319
grow

742
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
you're gonna go what did i feed it last

743
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,839
time did you spray it anything

744
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,599
and if i'm a consultant and i come to

745
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,439
your grow to help you out

746
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,038
those are the questions i'm gonna ask

747
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,120
did you spray anything

748
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,158
what was the last thing you sprayed how

749
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,359
many days ago

750
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
and then what was the product you

751
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,479
sprayed before that because let's see if

752
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,000
those two products

753
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,519
are having a reaction on your leaf

754
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
surface that could be [ __ ] everything

755
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,839
up

756
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,519
we may solve the problem just by looking

757
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,720
at paperwork we may not have to leave

758
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,038
the office

759
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
maybe you could have saved yourself half

760
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,440
of the consulting fee by doing it over

761
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
zoom

762
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
and not making me drive all the way to

763
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,519
your grow because the minute i put on my

764
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
dunks

765
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,639
i start charging you extra money if i'm

766
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,399
driving to the facility

767
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
it costs you double what it costs for

768
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,720
cost for me to do a consultation on zoom

769
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
that's just a business way of doing

770
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
things so you could save yourself

771
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
half the money by having double the

772
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
paperwork keep [ __ ] notes

773
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,759
so i'm going to ask you what did you

774
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,240
spray these plants what did you spray

775
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,440
them

776
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
before that how many milliliters of

777
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,919
whatever

778
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
[ __ ] you sprayed on there was in there

779
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,679
who applied it can we talk to them

780
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,119
did you soak the plants did you just

781
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,480
spray them till they're running off did

782
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,158
you spray them with a mist

783
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,679
did you spray them from the underside or

784
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
did you spray them from the top

785
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
when you sprayed them did you turn the

786
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,079
lights off or turn the lights on i've

787
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,520
got questions

788
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,279
hopefully you've got notes for those

789
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,038
answers then i'm going to ask you what

790
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,720
did you feed these plants last

791
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,720
i want to know what you fed them every

792
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,759
nutrient what was the ph what was the

793
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,200
ppm or ec

794
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,640
do you have a runoff chart that i can

795
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,038
look at to see what looked like for the

796
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
past

797
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,960
three weeks until the week when [ __ ]

798
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,759
went wrong those are the questions i'm

799
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,519
going to want to ask

800
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,960
then i'm going to ask you what was the

801
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,599
vpd

802
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,880
vpd can cause and solve so many problems

803
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,639
temperature and humidity

804
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
just like you bro if i put you outside

805
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
for two weeks and made you just deal

806
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,079
with [ __ ]

807
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,079
you'd be stressed out you'd go through

808
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,678
some problems you need a good vpd we can

809
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,279
fix your whole life with the vpd

810
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
issue so i'm gonna ask you all those

811
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,798
things have those notes

812
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,119
those are the notes i recommend having

813
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,839
for breeding uh you said phenol hunt for

814
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,839
breeding

815
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:35,439
um structure shape aroma leaf size

816
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:38,639
color uh trichome density trichome

817
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,120
size and shape some plants have

818
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,840
long skinny tall trichomes some have

819
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,319
shorter

820
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,158
thicker fatter trichomes though in my

821
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,798
opinion you get a different buzz from

822
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,320
those

823
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,599
are you breeding are you growing to make

824
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,960
concentrates if you're going to make

825
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,240
concentrates you want the taller

826
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,558
skinnier trichomes

827
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,839
they come apart from the buds better if

828
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,359
you're going to manhandle your buds

829
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,558
maybe you want those shorter thicker

830
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,079
