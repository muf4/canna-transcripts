00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,219
to start this episode off by talking

47
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,039
about some fun that I got to have this

48
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,859
week uh just recently allegedly possibly

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,340
maybe I was invited to attend a Green

50
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,318
Dot Labs tasting event and party it was

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,420
mainly a bud tender educational event

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,579
I'm not a bud tender I don't work for a

53
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,919
facility but Green Dot knows who I am

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,660
they know that I enjoy and promote their

55
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,098
products quite heavily so they did

56
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,659
invite me to come to their party and

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,359
enjoy their tasting and educational

58
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,799
event it was quite AI it was a great

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
event it was perfect it was quite an

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,520
experience it was quite a terpy evening

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
if I do so say say so myself that's

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
harder to say than it looks I've got a

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
lot of great notes Here let me scroll to

64
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,539
these notes and get myself on track it

65
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,859
was a great event it was I can't even

66
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,019
tell you where it was it was in Denver

67
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,599
that's good enough I was at a location

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,300
that had a non-alcoholic beverages

69
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,119
provided they provided pizza and then

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,660
most importantly they provided plenty of

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,459
dabs they had a nice dab bar set up a

72
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,780
little educational pamphlets everywhere

73
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,759
so you can read and learn about the

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,979
products they would have a dab multiple

75
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,739
dab station set up and at those stations

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,179
some had rosin and some had batter they

77
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,800
would have a little placard or a little

78
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,659
sign to let you know what strains were

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,760
at that table so it'd be like it would

80
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,840
be like rosin or I would say uh live

81
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,239
batter and then it would say like

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,459
fortissimo or rainbow belts or whatever

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,439
strains were at that table one table had

84
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,878
batter one had rosin another table had

85
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,620
batter another had rosin there are

86
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,539
several tables so you never had to wait

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,158
in too long of a line to get a dab if

88
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,239
you just win if you took a dab and then

89
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:25,739
went and walked around for a minute and

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,658
got in line you'd get another dab in

91
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,158
plenty of time there was no rush it was

92
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,560
a really great event they did it very

93
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,120
well everything was well organized you

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,739
did of course have to get an invite then

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,420
you had to get a ticket then you had to

96
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,980
show your ticket and ID to even enter

97
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,798
the building which I thought was perfect

98
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,818
it was a private party but it was such a

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,560
good time

100
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,780
uh there were several booths each Booth

101
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,340
I think was Opera offering three

102
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,439
different varieties of Green Dot

103
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,479
products I got to try a lot of great

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,098
stuff that I've never had before and

105
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,798
then I got to try things that I have had

106
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:57,298
before in a different setting off of a

107
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,799
different smoking device off of a

108
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,900
different rig perhaps through a puffco

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,000
but it was really good smoking

110
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,140
concentrates I'm familiar with in a

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,459
different environment with different

112
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,559
people getting a different experience

113
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,360
from the same flavors but then also

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,459
being exposed to brand new things that

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
are up and coming from Green Dot uh some

116
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm not even sure I can tell you about

117
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,478
so far but I tried a lot of batters I

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,000
smoked a lot of rosins I think my

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,879
favorite of the evening was the rainbow

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,800
belts V2 I think it was live rosin it

121
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,319
tasted like rosin it felt like rosin it

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,180
was freaking delicious I hit it kind of

123
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,918
hot the guy was kind of kind of confused

124
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,379
why I like to go so hot but I like them

125
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,539
hot and hurty bro but it tastes really

126
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,579
good it was the rainbow belts V2 live

127
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,040
rosin pretty sure it was my favorite if

128
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,258
it wasn't rosin it was batter it tastes

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
super good it had all of the right Terps

130
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,180
all of the right flavors it was gassy it

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,620
was fruity it had that diesel thing to

132
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,120
it at the bottom when you exhale it's

133
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,579
like it leaves a thing on your tongue

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,079
but then it left berries in my nose uh

135
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,099
really beautiful really good flavors

136
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,199
from that

137
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,479
um the rainbow belt's V2 it was a good

138
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,340
social experience

139
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,779
um I don't go out to bars and things I

140
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,519
don't drink alcohol the only reason I'm

141
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,679
really at a show or at a club or at a

142
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,659
bar or anything is for a show a comedy

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,978
show or some music so to be invited to

144
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,900
something social where there was not

145
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,180
alcohol it was not an alcohol-based

146
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,279
event we could actually go smoke and

147
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,780
enjoy smoking concentrates in public

148
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,638
there are smoking flour in there as well

149
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,019
but when I smoke too much flour in

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,460
public or too much flour at all my

151
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,379
throat gets dry and Scratchy I can't

152
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,599
talk right so try to stick with the Dabs

153
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,120
at public smoking and educational events

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,340
but it's a really fun the bar was

155
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,500
basically closed as a bar and it was

156
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,179
just turned into a hangout establishment

157
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,399
so there was no alcohol being served it

158
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,680
was all non-alcoholic cocktails plenty

159
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,939
of water hydration the restrooms are

160
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,759
easily accessible there was free

161
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,319
available even vegetarian friendly pizza

162
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,360
for the veggie heads over there that was

163
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,418
me but it was a really great experience

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,819
one thing I did notice is that I made a

165
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,859
joke about the puffco is the new Bud

166
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,000
Light nobody had a beer in that event

167
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,699
because it was an alcohol-free

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,399
establishment but everybody was carrying

169
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,960
a puffco and I used to frequent alcohol

170
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,399
drinking bars I used to go to the bar

171
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,138
all the time you guys and everybody's

172
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,478
got the way that they hold their beer

173
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,699
some guys hold the beer up here by their

174
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,019
chest some guys do the arm curl in and

175
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,240
kind of tuck it real close to their

176
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,740
chest some guys just hold it here some

177
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,000
guys hold it down here we all have our

178
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,978
place where we hold our beer it was

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,300
funny noticing everybody I don't drink

180
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,339
anymore so I don't hold my beer I hold

181
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,139
my puffco it was funny noticing how

182
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,000
everybody just where your puff coat was

183
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,139
placed in your holding position I

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,360
thought it was really entertaining so

185
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,300
the puffco peak or the puffco guardian

186
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,580
or maybe even the proxy is the new Bud

187
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,620
Light at hangout establishments I

188
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,939
thought that was very interesting

189
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,199
um that's enough rambling about the

190
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,399
Green Dot event I wanted to share that

191
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,259
with you guys I had a good time I

192
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,179

194

195
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,978

196
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,600

00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,038
fix that since I noticed it um also I'm

237
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,780
gonna make a quick disclaimer here

238
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,000
Green Dot does not pay me for any of

239
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,619
this uh advertising promotion I simply

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,598
think it's a good product I really enjoy

241
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,819
it it hits well it tastes good it's at

242
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,680
the right price point for me uh it gets

243
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,598
me highest giraffe [ __ ] and Eagle dicks

244
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,978
and that's what we're all after right it

245
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,839

246
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,878
recreational needs and it fits my budget

247
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,279

Green Dot Black Label is one of my

249
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
favorite products and to get even closer

250
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,098

go from here I've been getting one

269
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,338
question quite often it is time to

270
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,259
address this question a lot of people

271
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,820
have messaged on YouTube they've sent me

272
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,519
private messages they say hey bro what

273
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,200
happened to the Clone episode a while

274
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
back there was a great cloning episode

275
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,620
of the girl from your heart podcast on

276
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,740
YouTube but guess what

277
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,139
YouTube took that bad dog down YouTube

278
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,659
thinks that me showing you how to cut

279
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,879
clones and propagate plants is dangerous

280
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,379
they found that to be dangerous they

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,720
took down the video they gave my channel

282
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,458
a strike they gave me a community

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,899
guideline strike and if I get too many

284
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,359
of those within a certain time they will

285
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,039
shut down the channel so they took down

286
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,839
that one and they also took down the

287
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,879
popping and twisting and they took down

288
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,800
a couple other videos all in one it's

289
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,939
like a big Swoop a big sweep if you want

290
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,740
to call it I'm not sure what they were

291
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,180
doing I just felt like somebody was

292
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,680
bored over at YouTube they wanted to

293
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,120
find something to do to look busy so

294
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,919
they went and took down a couple of

295
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,539
videos of mine just to [ __ ] have what

296
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,819
is it a quota some credit for the day

297
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,159
looked like they did something but uh

298
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,320
yeah apparently uh creating smaller

299
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,059
plants from larger plants is harmful and

300
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,100
or dangerous it's a dangerous and

301
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,299
harmful activity so that YouTube took

302
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,639
that down if you guys are looking for

303
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,139
specific videos of the podcast I don't

304
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,059
take that down I work hard to make them

305
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,919
I like them all up there I think it's uh

306
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,778
it's kind of a timeline what is it a

307
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,519
[ __ ] a timeline what's the thing when

308
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:19,740
you bury it the time capsule it's a time

309
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,440
capsule and it's also historical it's a

310
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,180
historical document the podcast is even

311
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,800
if I take down episodes the things I

312
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,599
said the opinions I had don't disappear

313
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,039
that's how I felt at that time I don't

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,659
take him down because I work hard I want

315
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,778
that to be up there it's a timeline a

316
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,399
time capsule it's history I'm

317
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:37,379
documenting the evolution of my

318
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,778
experience in cannabis I feel like I was

319
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,338
at the right place at the right time to

320
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,139
kind of have a voice in the Cannabis

321
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,000
world and so I'm documenting my

322
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,860
experience and I don't want to edit

323
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,379
delete alter or any of that that's why

324
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,060
some people that aren't even in the crew

325
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,100
anymore some people that I don't talk to

326
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,479
anymore they are on old episodes of the

327
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,459
podcast and people say wouldn't you take

328
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,259
that down I said nah bro if I took down

329
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,059
that episode it doesn't change the fact

330
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,980
that that person came here and did that

331
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,659
show we were friends we were business

332
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,879
partners we were whatever at one point

333
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,919
we're still the world still happens just

334
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,600
I can't delete an episode and [ __ ] so my

335
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,278
point you guys I try not to change the

336
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
timeline try not to change the archive

337
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,059
if you will I do believe in preserving

338
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,979
that archive kind of that's one of my

339
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,899
roles in cannabis is to keep that that

340
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,399
archive that history true and accurate I

341
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,700
don't like when people mix up stories

342
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,440
and [ __ ] until uh Miss uh myths and lies

343
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,899
and misconceptions of cannabis and the

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,579
history of it so that's why I try not to

345
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,259
delete [ __ ] but those episodes are gone

346
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,659
because YouTube I don't take them down

347
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,759
that's the short version of that all

348
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:39,120
right now let me respond to some other

349
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,799
things so many haters oh my goodness

350
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,078
it's okay it doesn't hurt me it doesn't

351
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,019
bother me but when I talk about running

352
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,458
my light schedule on 18 6 at the end of

353
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,899
flower I've talked about this enough I

354
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,078
shouldn't have to recap really quickly

355
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,778
we will uh the last 10 maybe 14 days of

356
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,179
flower I put my lights back on 18 hours

357
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,620
on and 16 hours off it is my belief that

358
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,539
light is the number one source of energy

359
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,799
for our plants they'll finish a little

360
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,539
more quickly they'll get a little more

361
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,000
dense it does have benefits I think it

362
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,860
works very well a lot of you out there

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,539
hear me say this and you are really

364
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,419
quick to get up on your keyboard and

365
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,278
just start telling me I'm an idiot that

366
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,899
I'm stupid that I'm ruining plants that

367
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,120
I've never grown a plant in my life that

368
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,799
I don't know what I'm doing which I

369
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,019
don't talk about things on the podcast

370
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,179
unless I've done it plenty of times I'm

371
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,919
not going to steer people wrong but a

372
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,359
lot of haters so many haters are sending

373
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,159
me documents you're sending me charts

374
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,379
they're sending me graphs that's [ __ ]

375
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:34,139
cool I love it don't stop educate me

376
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,820
inform me update me but but also guess

377
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,799
what you guys I got a lot of supporters

378
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,320
people that are actually doing it that

379
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,719
are sending me uh what is it graphs

380
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,040
charts reports and also they're sending

381
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,660
me pictures of their plants that look

382
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,458
better they're sending me reports saying

383
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,259
my buds were more dense I had more

384
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,879
weight I got more product I'm more

385
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,740
satisfied than I ever was because I did

386
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,860
the little trick that you told me so

387
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,139
it's only people who are not doing it

388
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,879
that are unhappy with my idea the people

389
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,740
that have tried it have all said hey

390
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,299
that works bro and if it doesn't work

391
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,039
for you when you try it then guess what

392
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,778
I apologize not all [ __ ] works for

393
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,519
everybody but so far nobody has

394
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,320
complained so the only people saying it

395
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,179
doesn't work and the only people telling

396
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,620
me that I'm crazy are the people that

397
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,199
haven't tried it the people doing it

398
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,940
they seem to be liking it so it doesn't

399
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,320
matter to me what light schedule you run

400
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,760
it really doesn't as long as you're

401
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,139
happy with the way that the plants come

402
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,000
out it shouldn't bother you so much that

403
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,159
I'm doing something differently seems to

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,139
be working for a lot of people try it

405
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,879
try it then bash me if you try it and

406
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,560
[ __ ] hate it then send me some hate

407
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,379
mail but don't don't just send me hate

408
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,299
mail because you think it is fun uh but

409
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,980
my one of my points here is don't don't

410
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,659
be afraid to try a new [ __ ] you can call

411
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,339
me crazy if you want to but don't be

412
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,419
afraid to try some new things how do you

413
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,100
know if it's going to work how do you

414
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,719
know if it's not one of my favorite

415
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,820
things about growing cannabis is that

416
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,040
there's no one way of doing this we're

417
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,019
all doing this differently I learned how

418
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,639
to do this kind of before we had a lot

419
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,019
of resources on the internet I was doing

420
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,879
this in different places where you had

421
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,860
to we had to be real quiet real careful

422
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,379
about it so I was learning how to do

423
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,879
this way back in the day I was doing it

424
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,379
way differently than the guy down the

425
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,939
street doing it then the other guy doing

426
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,740
it then all the other guys doing it

427
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,600
we're all doing it our own way it's like

428
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,740
music we're going to do it a little bit

429
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,540
differently we're going to use different

430
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,220
gear different schedules different ideas

431
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,199
definitely different genetics different

432
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,519
nutrients but guess what we're all going

433
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,620
to make music we're all going to make

434
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,379
really delicious buds in the end there's

435
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,879
no one way to grow a ganja plant if you

436
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,799
have quality buds that aren't

437
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,299
contaminated by some mold or pesticide

438
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,338
at the end that you're cool with smoking

439
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,259
that the people in your circle whether

440
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,940
it's your patients your friends maybe

441
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,620
it's your clientele maybe it's your

442
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,120
family who have ever smoking it if

443
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,740
they're happy with it you're doing it

444
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,379
right you're not doing it wrong we all

445
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,680
have the same goal so let's all be on

446
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:46,198
the same team recently I accidentally

447
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,359
got involved in a debate about drying

448
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,039
and curing temperature and humidity

449
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,480
somebody thinks a friend of mine bro

450
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,219
you're going to hear this you're my

451
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,839
friend we disagree and guess what still

452
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,040
love you bro I'll [ __ ] sit next to

453
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,660
you and smoke a bowl with you we'll talk

454
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,458
about something different I won't even

455
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,439
care that we disagree who cares that we

456
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,299
disagree we do [ __ ] different my point

457
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,800
is I'm involved in a conversation about

458
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,479
drying and curing it's an argument it's

459
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,059
an ongoing argument between multiple

460
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,039
people I didn't make it an argument I'm

461
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,899
saying here's my opinion that's [ __ ]

462
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,399
what I do I don't I'm not saying I don't

463
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,620
care what you do but it doesn't matter

464
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,839
to me what happens in other people's

465
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,519
Garden I hope you have success I hope

466
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,600
you do really well it's none of my

467
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,159
business what you're doing in there

468
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,420
unless you ask for my help or you need

469
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,740
some guidance I shouldn't even be

470
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,479
peeking in there I shouldn't have an

471
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,519
opinion so my friend that drives and

472
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,139
cures differently than me bro do your

473
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,879
thing Pimpin dry and cure differently

474
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,759
than me as long as your weed comes out

475
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,919
good I don't care if it's different as

476
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,778
long as it's correct my main guideline

477
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,519
the things I do care about is is there

478
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:44,159
mold in there is there a pesticide

479
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,899
contamination in there is it funky you

480
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,120
know if there's mold pesticides or if

481
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,980
it's funky do we want to smoke it you've

482
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,720
got ethics I've got ethics if it's cool

483
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,759
I don't care how it's dried and cured if

484
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,639
it lungs as long as it comes out trimmed

485
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,620
dried cured and dank weed I don't care

486
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,778
how you did it so my point here is let's

487
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,459
learn together my friend has a

488
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,860
completely different idea of how to dry

489
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,958
and cure weed than I do but he grows

490
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,459
great weed we both grow top quality

491
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,259
wheat I would smoke his weed he would

492
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,638
smoke my weed we would argue for a

493
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,379
minute about drying caring guess what a

494
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,299
high five him give him a hug pack them

495
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,278
up a fat bong rip pass them a dab he'd

496
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,719
do the same for me if I drink beer I'm

497
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,879
sure we'd crack open a beer together and

498
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,199
do that it's not my thing but bro you

499
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,519
know who you are everybody in the

500
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,679
community that was in that conversation

501
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,299
we know who we are I'm not mad at you

502
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,439
but I love all you guys if it has

503
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,299
anything to do if we're doing things

504
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,220
different that's great that may inspire

505
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,419
me that may educate me that may Inspire

506
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,740
spark me to do things different

507
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,899
differently and learn some different

508
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,820
[ __ ] we're all on the same team here

509
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,259
we've all got the same goal so before

510
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,639
you go jumping down someone's throat

511
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,620
because they grow weed differently than

512
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,659
you maybe maybe you just realize we're

513
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,278
on the same team we've got the same goal

514
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,899
let's not fight about it let's teach

515
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,578
each other also be open to learn

516
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,799
something be open to teach something it

517
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,899
goes both directions

518
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,578
all right after a brief distraction I am

519
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,620
back ladies and gentlemen keep the

520
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,359
conversation going in the comments keep

521
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,980
the emails coming the email address is

522
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,279
grow from your heart at hotmail.com

523
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,439
don't be shy also the grow help tab on

524
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,178
the website is now corrected I did

525
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,279
notice that the emails from The Grow

526
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,980
help tab were not being forwarded to my

527
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,660
email inbox that has been corrected if

528
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,400
you have asked a grow question on the

529
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,900
grow help tab recently and I have not

530
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,120
responded to you or answered that

531
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,980
question on the show please do resend

532
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,279
that question once again on the updated

533
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,720
grow help tab you'll find that at

534
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,639
iregenetics.com there's a tab on the top

535
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,019
that says grow help simply click on

536
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,299
there that will give you the grow help

537
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,759
tab ask you a few questions that will

538
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,619
send your message directly to my inbox I

539
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,480
will now before it was not something got

540
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,279
broken in the chain there but now it

541
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,900
will send that to my inbox big shout out

542
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,240
to the web guy for fixing that thank you

543
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,919
bro but please do send those messages to

544
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,440
the grow help tab I will get your grow

545
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,860
help questions here on the podcast help

546
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,419
me to build listener generated content

547
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,099
all right I do have more to talk about

548
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:58,559
another common question I've been

549
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:01,199
getting lately involving that 18 6 light

550
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,660
cycle is do I change the light intensity

551
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
when I switch my lights from 12 12 to 18

552
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,058
6 do I change the intensity of the bulbs

553
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,740
at all my answer is no I've been

554
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,079
spinning the entire flowering cycle

555
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,940
ramping up from one point in my light

556
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,918
game all the way up to the maximum light

557
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,140
of my lights or the maximum potential of

558
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,000
my lights I let them go

559
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,820
They Ride for a couple of weeks at full

560
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,619
potential then I put them back on 18-6 I

561
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,960
don't want to reduce the intensity in my

562
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:29,939
room I keep it the same your room may

563
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,259
need reduction if you've got LEDs and

564
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,120
you've gone all the way up and you're

565
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,740
close to cooking them pay attention to

566
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,779
the leaves pay attention to the plants

567
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,759
this is called the DLI The Daily Light

568
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,918
integral the plants are going to look a

569
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,779
little bit confused and frustrated but I

570
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,880
do not dial back the intensity if the

571
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,918
leaves start looking crispy or burnt you

572
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,260
may need to dial it back I do not do

573
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,259
that I usually start when I go into

574
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:54,660
flower my LEDs are usually around 50 to

575
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,640
60 percent of their power then I slowly

576
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,940
increase them and by week seven eight or

577
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,179
nine I am generally up to 100 power my

578
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,220
LEDs don't have a real clear percentage

579
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,840
dial on them they've got a you put a

580
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,400
screwdriver and turn a screw and it

581
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,439
turns all the way this way is

582
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,200
approximately 50 percent all the way

583
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,240
this way is 100 I start here when they

584
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,340
go into flower and I slowly crank them

585
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,839
up I nudge them just a little bit every

586
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,699
week just a little bit of a percent I

587
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,038
can't tell you precisely how much it is

588
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,960
honestly but I know I start at 50 and

589
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,298
then I do end up at 100 and I do not

590
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,019
turn that intensity down once I get it

591
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,240
there

592
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,798
now if I'm using a high pressure sodium

593
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,538
lamp in this room which sometimes I do

594
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,220
because in the winter it gets really

595
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:36,960
cold and the led doesn't keep the room

596
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,000
warm so I just use a high pressure

597
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,798
sodium bulb to keep the room warm and

598
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,900
spread some light around if I'm using

599
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,879
the high pressure sodium I simply lower

600
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,980
that light or raise that light to adjust

601
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,660
the intensity most of the time it just

602
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,880
stays in the one spot I don't move it

603
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,558
after I've done the change LEDs you do

604
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,299
have to keep them kind of far from the

605
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,980
canopy still so if your plants have

606
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:57,660
grown up real tall and flowered into the

607
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,000
lighting then you may need to do some

608
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,160
height adjustments or possibly some

609
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,720
intensity adjustments accordingly I do

610
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,820
plan ahead for that sort of stuff so I

611
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,279
don't have to cut back intensity at all

612
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,918
when it comes to that 18 6 flowering

613
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,079
cycle toward the end so in my space in

614
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,820
my grow in my application I do not

615
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,099
reduce the light intensity I do not

616
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,960
raise it I do not lower it I simply plan

617
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,000
ahead and know what to expect I allow

618
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,220
that extra space between the bulbs and

619
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
between my lights and I slowly ramp it

620
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,000
up you guys you should be in my opinion

621
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,798
from what I've learned with LED lighting

622
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,419
is we should not be just putting the

623
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,859
plants under there at full intensity if

624
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,960
you've got a good strong quality light

625
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,000
if you've got a low intensity low output

626
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,319
LED light that's not putting out a whole

627
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,179
bunch of spectrum a whole bunch of light

628
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,500
maybe you can crank that [ __ ] up but

629
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,059
when the plants are little they don't

630
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,619
need all that LED lighting from what

631
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:45,720
I've learned get the plant or the light

632
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,759
at the right height dial it down low and

633
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,380
as the plant grows slowly increase that

634
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,419
saves some boosting for when it goes

635
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,580
into flour you want to add some Lumen

636
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,340
add some intensity when it does go into

637
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:58,139
flour so slowly increase them from Veg

638
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,879
as they grow as they grow into flour

639
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,740
increase it a little more so that around

640
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,080
week seven eight or nine then you

641
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,660
finally reached your full potential some

642
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,980
people go at week six some go later that

643
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,600
is up to you and you're white but it's

644
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,099
easier if you ramp it up just a little

645
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,259
bit you'll notice the plants do perform

646
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:14,399
a little bit better all right we're

647
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,960
going to talk about one more thing

648
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,120
before we start wrapping up this episode

649
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,160
another question that I do get quite

650
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,479
often this is a good question this is a

651
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,000
fun one it's an easy one to answer

652
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,579
people often ask me hey Ross did Jeff

653
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,500
what are table seeds if you buy seeds

654
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,240
from iridirect or if you've got seats

655
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,519
for me in the past there's a good chance

656
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,339
that you've received table seeds as a

657
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,819
freebie as a gift table seeds are simply

658
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:41,879
table seeds when I make packages I will

659
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,918
get my my amount of seeds maybe I'll

660
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,600
have an amount of I'm just going to say

661
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,780
random strains maybe there's strawberry

662
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,339
Starburst maybe there's moon tower maybe

663
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,200
there's Jack Tripper seeds that I'm

664
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,699
packaging up today so I'll get my

665
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,960
packaging supplies I'll get my seeds

666
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,519
I'll get my light I'll get my little

667
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,259
setup and I'll package up a bunch of

668
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,879
seeds I'll go through the strawberry

669
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,259
Starburst I'll go through the moon tower

670
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,580
I'll go through the whatever other

671
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,319
strain that I said I'll package up

672
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,298
however many packages I'm aiming to do

673
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,519
I'll clean up and then I notice that

674
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:10,019
sometimes maybe over here under the iPad

675
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,759
stand there's a couple of seeds and over

676
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,200
here by the the recording device there's

677
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,119
a couple of seeds that just rolled away

678
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,679
or there's a seed over here by my phone

679
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,259
that just got away and I'm not sure what

680
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,880
it is I can't sell you those seeds in a

681
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,500
package because I can't guarantee which

682
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,120
batch of seeds they came from they could

683
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,400
have been anything that I worked on

684
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,899
today or maybe something from a couple

685
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,580
of days ago that I didn't even see on

686
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,440
the table I didn't clean up well enough

687
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,658
and I found seeds that are just sitting

688
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,360
there so those table seeds are random

689
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,520
seeds from my inventory that could be

690
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,798
anything thing from my lineup they could

691
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,480
be regular they could be feminized they

692
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,220
could be testers they could be

693
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,440
unreleased beans that I was counting for

694
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,640
myself and one got away it could have

695
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,220
been something I was sharing with a

696
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,220
friend and one rolled off to the side my

697
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,900
table seeds could be anything we do like

698
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,339
to post the table seeds to the Discord

699
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,140
if you were on the Discord find the

700
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,119
table seed section post the pictures in

701
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,100
there we have a lot of fun guessing and

702
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,439
speculating what they could be but

703
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,019
honestly they could be anything from My

704
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,700
Vault old stuff new stuff future stuff

705
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,158
it could be [ __ ] that's not even thought

706
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,140
of or released that you know of yet it

707
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,820
could be stuff I'm keeping secret maybe

708
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,020
I was breaking off seeds to send to one

709
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,519
of my favorite friends who's going to

710
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,139
test them maybe I was given Dave's not

711
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,240
here are some seeds and I just

712
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,500
accidentally spilled a couple who knows

713
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,960
what it could be so they could be

714
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,298
anything from the irie genetics lineup

715
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,798
if you get table seeds I encourage you

716
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,240
to grow them those were gifts they are

717
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,918
freebies I don't charge anything for

718
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,900
those I don't ask anything for those

719
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,880
they just come in your box randomly so

720
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,740
if you get those grow them if you have a

721
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,480
winner or a gym send me some pictures

722
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,179
let me know what it smells like how it

723
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,819
grew how it acted maybe just for fun we

724
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,500
can try to identify your table seeds

725
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:48,359
all right that is what table seeds are

726
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,980
