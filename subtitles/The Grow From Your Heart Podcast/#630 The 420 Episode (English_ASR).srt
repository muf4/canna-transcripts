have any idea why we celebrate 420 what

630
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,038
this is all about are we just smoking

631
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,599
because we're smoking from the storyline

632
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,119
students thing yeah okay all right so i

633
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,399
know i i think i know a little bit about

634
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,159
it it was some college students in

635
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,440
california that would uh

636
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
smoke i believe it was at 4 20 after a

637
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,279
certain class right

638
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
i could be yeah i think they were

639
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,160
getting out of school got out of school

640
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
about four and they'd all meet it

641
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
at a place at a certain stature i

642
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,919
believe it was at 4 20.

643
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,678
yeah i heard it was like some college

644
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,720
kids in norcal [ __ ]

645
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,000
like grateful dead kids i'm pretty sure

646
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,038
some of them were deadheads yeah i'm

647
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
pretty sure a couple of them were

648
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,119
deadheads

649
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,720
i was a group they called themselves the

650
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,279
waldos is actually what the group was

651
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
called

652
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,759
and so most of the story is basically

653
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
yeah they would just meet every day at

654
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,879
this one spot and

655
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,160
smoke at 420 and that's where 420 came

656
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
from so we owe

657
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
this holiday this meeting this podcast

658
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,439
is all because of a bunch of dorks that

659
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,480
wanted to gather after school and smoke

660
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,200
some weed together

661
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,038
and they made a time 4 20 and it stuck

662
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,679
imagine starting a legend that big

663
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,798

of most of what i smoke when it comes to

833
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
rosin but

834
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,959
just have to figure uh figure out how to

835
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,879
do that correctly that looks good

836
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,079
you know i have a sequence i have not as

837
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120

839
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,000
about that because that thing's

840
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,839
interesting pink lemonade ambrosia from

841
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,880
apothecary farms i recognize those

842
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,480

848
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,839

some good clear looking concentrates bro

850
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,720
thank you this is uh some durbin poison

851
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,839
live resin

852
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,079
nice very it's delicious

853
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,278
it's still magically delicious all right

854
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,639
let's talk about that little uh

855
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:31,679
little thermometer thing you've got over

856
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
there i've seen a lot of people with

857
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,759
that i'm gonna put you up here on the

858
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,159
main screen

859
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,798
what happened oh we got cuz up there we

860
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,720
go the turpa meter there we go

861
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,480
they're like a hundred bucks and it

862
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,200
tells the temperature

863
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
using a thermocoupler yeah mold it for

864
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
the camera

865
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,359
and it's really really probably the best

866
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,400
way

867
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,359
to tell the temperature for uh a banger

868
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,038
you can't use it for like a slurper but

869
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,639
phenomenal right

870
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,759
so basically heat up your banger stick

871
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
it right on in there and wait till it

872
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,240
gets the temperature that you're

873
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
comfortable with and then rip it

874
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,159
yeah it'll rise up until it like settles

875
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,200
and then once it starts dropping in temp

876
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
you know

877
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,278
yeah yeah that's cool at a steady temp

878
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
so i try to dab anywhere between four

879
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,240
and five hundred usually

880
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,840
all right this is to read uh

881
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,159
are you getting 70 degrees off of an ir

882
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,599
thermometer and it stays at the same

883
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,278
temperature the whole dab

884
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,278
yeah an email is really nice and you you

885
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,000
can use this to calibrate your email as

886
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,359
well

887
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,359
oh that's pretty sweet we did that at my

888
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,278
buddy's house so we could put it on the

889
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,158
email and adjusted the email accordingly

890
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,720
it's a great idea

891
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
yeah that's awesome i like an email but

892
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,558
uh for some reason i

893
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,839
it just doesn't it's not hot enough to

894
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,119
i've got to heat up my bang or any way

895
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,480
to clean it or something it just doesn't

896
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,079
it's not efficient for me i love having

897
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,278
it around it'd be good right now

898
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,798
if i had a center i would hit the email

899
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,240
so i didn't have to have the torch going

900
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,119
but for the most part i prefer just

901
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,798
torching it up and

902
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,000
doing it that way but that's a beautiful

903
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,759
setup you got cuz the mothership

904
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,519
yeah it's another cord on the table for

905
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,798
a podcaster that's a whole nother thing

906
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,679
that's true i see arguments i've owned

907
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,918
an email as well

908
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,038
many rigs perished to the uh the old

909
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
email cord

910
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,319
i've seen it pull a joint right off

911
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,599
before yeah i've seen last killers for

912
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,798
sure

913
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,918
but to each their own that's why they

914
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,119
make a lot of different toys and that's

915
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,038
why potheads buy them because we love

916
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,119
toys and it's a lot of good clean fun

917
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,158
um since nobody asked i'm dabbing on

918
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,319
picasso

919
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,840

997
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,240
over 2 000 people in that venue

998
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,159
and we're going to be friends with the

999
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,120
owners so it's a really cool venue and

1000
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,000
if you're looking for a

1001
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,439
place to host the cannabis event it's a

1002
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,640
the largest place you can legally do

1003
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,000
that type of event united states right

1004
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,679
now damn i didn't know i guess i know

1005
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
where we're building the commune

1006
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,919
hey hey there's also a big casino there

1007
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
so like if you guys want to lose like a

1008
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,000
bunch of money

1009
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,000
you know i mean to an airport

1010
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,879
like oklahoma city i think it's two

1011
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
hours north and i think dallas is like

1012
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
an hour

1013
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,519
south so like pick your airport i i

1014
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,960
would suggest dallas first of all

1015
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,038
you gotta fly somewhere and get a rental

1016
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,399
car but it sounds yeah it was cheaper

1017
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:39,200
yeah yeah oklahoma city airport sucks a

1018
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,599
dick it's not a real airport

1019
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,319

00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,759
overwhelming through these earbuds so

1058
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,038
i'm gonna have to start some kind of

1059
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,960
conversation so you guys could talk

1060
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,798
while i smoke it yeah because i got a

1061
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,079
an idea that i had actually just like

1062
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,599
yesterday it's all yours buddy i'm

1063
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,439
muting my mic let's hear it

1064
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,959
so uh i was thinking about starting a

1065
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,798
little you know i'm everyone's doing

1066
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
podcast right but i thought

1067
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,720
what if uh we use the discord for a

1068
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
source for content

1069
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,558
and we've got a channel on there already

1070
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,919
called the hotbox we could just do like

1071
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,558
the hotbox live

1072
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,600
and it would just be a disc you know it

1073
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,678
it's a i think it's a

1074
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,038
limit of four people in that chat room

1075
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,679
so you just do like a

1076
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,720
pow wow chat go live and uh just

1077
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,320
broadcast it to the internet

1078
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,480
i mean we talk about all sorts of stuff

1079
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:42,079
on uh the discord from

1080
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,640
i was ranting out and raving about uh

1081
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,759
molten salt thorium reactors the other

1082
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,480
day

1083
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,839
but we talk about growing and we help

1084
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
people identify past

1085
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,158
problems and all sorts of cool stuff on

1086
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,240
there it's a real cool community

1087
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
sounds fun if i'm going to do more live

1088
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,880
stuff i'm going to do

1089
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,960
something that goes up on youtube and

1090
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,159
patreon is my next idea because i owe my

1091
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,840
patrons something

1092
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,840
and i can't figure out what to give them

1093
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,839
i don't want to give them merch

1094
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,838
i know it does it i i don't like the

1095
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,838
name of it but it's like a new

1096
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,519
type of patreon and there's a lot i'm

1097
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,960
gonna take it down

1098
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,960
like this okay just a new

1099
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,639
there's a lot of new stuff coming up

1100
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,280
like that with like the brave browser

1101
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,559
and uh earning crypto from like people

1102
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,079
just viewing your

1103
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,358
your post and stuff like that

1104
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,280
technology's kind of i need to clone

1105
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,319
myself if i want to do that

1106
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,240
that's why i feel like i need to do

1107
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,599
something just for patreon because uh

1108
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,799
the patreons contribute and they don't

1109
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,559
really get anything extra they get a

1110
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
shout out they get a high five

1111
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,440
i don't want to be uh committed to

1112
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,639
giving them merchandise every month

1113
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,559
because that's more merch i have to

1114
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,000
come up with and print ship and deliver

1115
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,199
so i feel like if i just did like a live

1116
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,239
show or something for the patrons that'd

1117
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,598
be really cool

1118
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,519
yeah so something that's the plan it's

1119
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
usually the way to go with that kind of

1120
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,280
stuff

1121
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,200
did you guys get sweaty from that dad

1122
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,800

1126
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,838
show for a moment

1127
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,800

1155
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,039
i pulled out some of the uh i said i was

1156
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
keeping some of mine around from january

1157
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,838
i pulled out some of the raphael

1158
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,239
that i grew uh back over the winter and

1159
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:33,838
uh

1160
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,838
can you pull some out of the jar

1161
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,199
absolutely that might help it focus a

1162
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,159
lot

1163
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,159
but yeah so i kept a small jar of this

1164
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,799
around because like i love the flavor so

1165
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,239
much and

1166
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,320
you know like stabby said earlier i

1167
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,759
don't have a huge grow so like

1168
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,440
when i pull something down i like to try

1169
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,800
and keep at least one small jar of it

1170
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,079
just kind of stashed away for like

1171
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,760
special occasions

1172
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,320
and today i feel like you know it's a

1173
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,160
pretty special occasion

1174
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,160
but the rafael

1175
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,440
oh there you go yeah um

1176
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,880
i've gotten so many compliments off of

1177
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
people that have smoked it

1178
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,119
they said you know it's everything from

1179
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,160
like strawberry candy to like

1180
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,000
blueberry shisha and you know just the

1181
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,358
the flavor profile on it it's very

1182
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
complex

1183
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,199
nobody can really 100 percent nail down

1184
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,400
what it is

1185
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,118
yeah she's she's absolutely frosty and

1186
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
it's i've had her probably for like

1187
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,838
close to three years now

1188
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,000
that i've kept her around and it was

1189
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,078
not even gonna lie it was like a one pop

1190
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,639
wonder like i still have

1191
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,480
most of the seeds left from the the

1192
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,480
femme pack that i bought

1193
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,639
you know it was just a one-seed wonder

1194
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,719
so there could be something even

1195
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,920
better in there that i don't even know

1196
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,118
about yet

1197
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,639
you've already got a champion i love

1198
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,838
that you say there's a flavor a thing in

1199
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,199
there that you can't describe because i

1200
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:57,440
always say it's got something

1201
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:59,679
like a funk or a wang or just uh

1202
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
nose curling goodness there is this

1203
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,639
something that

1204
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,000
everybody just they just can't nail it

1205
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,639
down what it is but

1206
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,199
it they're like one person says it's

1207
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,358
grape

1208
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,358
one person says it's cough syrup one

1209
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,319
person says it's strawberry candy one

1210
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,960
person says it's

1211
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,838
blueberry like it it changes flavor

1212
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,039
profiles as

1213
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,078
different people like get to yeah yeah

1214
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,358
i was in a sliver shop

1215
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,440
yeah randomly right i was at a sneaker

1216
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,880
shop and somebody opened a red bull

1217
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,039
and i thought oh that's the blueberry

1218
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
cookies i've never smelled anything that

1219
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,159
had that same

1220
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,519
that made me that familiar and it's got

1221
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,199
a little bit of a red bull sort of all

1222
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,800
the blueberry cookies crosses

1223
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,159
have that like how red bull is almost

1224
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
gross from far away but as you get

1225
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,239
closer it turns into berries

1226
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,599
it had like an energy drink to it and it

1227
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,399
definitely made me think about blueberry

1228
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,800
cookies it was

1229
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,480
just similar to that jeff that had that

1230
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,920
i was listening to the most recent

1231

1240
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,960

1241
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,959
tip of your tongue

1242
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,480
all of the websites because it can't say

1243
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,598
wang now no no no

1244
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,639

1245
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,160
maybe tang is the word i gotta read you

1246
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,440
all the websites in the description

1247
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:41,759
like a weird tagginess yeah

1248
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:45,519
yeah a tangy

1249
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,520
the old panda somebody got the giggles

1250
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,679
is that burn that was burnt shout out to

1251
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,000
burn i hope she can hear this i was uh

1252
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,279
you know i got to test the uh the

1253
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,239
blueberry butcher

1254
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,079
and i was trying to like pinpoint the

1255
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,319
berry smells that i was getting off of

1256
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
it

1257
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
and it kept changing throughout the grow

1258
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,200
right like early on i swear i was

1259
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,760
getting like some

1260
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,759
some uh like sour cherry smells or

1261
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
something like that but i think

1262
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,440
uh it was like an elderberry or

1263
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,760
something and that's not a

1264
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
a note that i'm really terribly familiar

1265
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,240
with you know what i mean

1266
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,240
but there's definitely something uh

1267
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,159
different about it not like a fermented

1268
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
because i've had plants before

1269
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,759
they had like that fermented berries or

1270
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,759
almost like a wine

1271
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,040
uh terpene to it when when it was

1272
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,599
finished curing

1273
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,480
uh but this was like a like a fresh

1274
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,039
berry smell

1275
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,079
to it and then i had a recent on a

1276
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,400
recent show i said

1277
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,519
elderberries too oh nice a squatty fino

1278
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,559
huh yeah

1279
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,838
the squatty was uh like a

1280
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:51,679
lemon lime citrus soda

1281
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,799
did it have a hint of urinal cakes uh

1282
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,519
i'd have to check it

1283
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,880
to see how i mean it's it's all dry now

1284
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,440
and you know what urinal cakes taste

1285
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
like

1286
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,880
i worked out ten years i cleaned the

1287
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,039
pizza a lot

1288
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,079
so are the different colors different

1289
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,440
are they the same

1290
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,039
most of them smell like uh like

1291
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,760
spearmint bubbles spearmint gum or

1292
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,759
something you know

1293
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,079
that gummy stuff it's another lemon

1294
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,079
smell

1295
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,079
yeah i had a i had a lot of berry phenos

1296
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,719
in the ones that i had but i also had a

1297
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,240
lot of those

1298
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,279
uh world uh phylotaxi or whatever

1299
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,439
whatever it's called

1300
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
the uh the triple nodes or the triple

1301
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,480
bridges yeah each nodes

1302
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,679
uh which number was that two or four

1303
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,559
that does that one of those does that

1304
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,838
more than the other

1305
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,599
i think it's number two that does that

1306
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,039
more than the other

1307

because i've had it for a minute but i

1338
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,440
keep going back for this because they're

1339
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,838
killing it

1340
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
this is double dose i bred this and it

1341
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,599
was grown

1342
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,039
by oh man i know the grower it's a

1343
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,640
commercial grow mike knows the name of

1344
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,000
them too they're the one the grow that

1345
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:58,239

and they sell it at a dispensary near me

1348
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,039
for a reasonable price but they don't

1349
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,799
let you buy more than a quarter at a

1350
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,079
time so i got to go in there a couple

1351
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,359
times a week and get a quarter but

1352
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,280
that's the double dose

1353
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,559
dried flour i'm digging it's pretty good

1354
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,839
it's got a nice flavor to it

1355
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,000
it's a little too dry by now i think

1356
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,519
they've had the same batch for a while

1357

nice nice i haven't got some packs of

1359

i've got a blue raspberry truffle i got

1366
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,879
a bunch of iron genetics [ __ ] in there

1367
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,759
perf's got some nice looking herb

1368

1369
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,960

like dude look at this thing like

1376
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,280
how how can you complain when something

1377
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,640
like that shows up oh zappy girl

girl dude yeah and that's a good

1380
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,159
phenotype i recognize that

1381
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,598
i can recognize that leaf structure

1382
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,399
there are

1383
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,519
it's uh three leaves per node if that if

1384
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,960
that helps any

1385
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,639
all right that's uh that one's really

1386
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,159
easy to trim too yeah

1387
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,519
yeah it's the that's the 1091 leaf yeah

1388
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,639
so i'm excited to

1389
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,800
to play with this one she's gonna be fun

1390
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,239
and it's nice too like because it's

1391
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,000
already been hunted out like he grew a

1392
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,679
couple of them i know it's a girl i know

1393
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,599
it's gonna be pretty decent

1394
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,799
so now i just get to stick it in my soil

1395
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,160
and see how it does

1396
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,160
there you go learn that girl see how

1397
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,480
much nitrogen phosphorus potassium

1398
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,159
led light she likes and growing under

1399
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,838
the leds is a whole new curve for me i'm

1400

1407
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,959
quarantine

1408
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,039
yeah yeah yeah i

1409

didn't even hear you guys say to get the

1410
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,000
point in quarantine

1411
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,879
yeah i had a question for you guys

1412
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,358
yes two weeks one question

1413
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,880
so um we're going into the outdoor

1414
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,639
season here soon

1415
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,358
so um what do you think uh jeff and and

1416
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,519
everyone else

1417
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,199
what are the best strains uh for my

1418
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,039
regenetics to grow outdoor

1419
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,279
if you want to grow some and that's a

1420
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:51,039
great question uh strains that would be

1421
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,000
you know really resistant to bud mold

1422
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,719
or bud rot uh maybe somehow don't

1423
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,599
attract moths because moss

1424
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,559
get out of my stuff last year you just

1425
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,920
gave me a really

1426
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,838
uh so the strain i was going to say to

1427
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,119
answer your question uh before i do it i

1428

1431
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:10,239

can

1438
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,800
uh but for outdoor for ivory genetics i

1439
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,800
would definitely recommend the morning

1440
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,720
do in almost all locations

1441
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
uh the morning do i say it's funny

1442
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,039
because it smells like mothballs and you

1443
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,039
just said what's gonna

1444
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,159
get the moths away uh maybe that's got

1445
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,279
something to do with why the bugs don't

1446
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,399
get to but it doesn't get mold it

1447
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,920
doesn't get mildew

1448
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,440
ah it grows really well outdoor so that

1449
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
morning due is killer for the outdoor

1450
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,200
uh environment if you've got a longer

1451
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,160
flowering season the sun kiss will do

1452
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,759
really well for you

1453
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,199
our buddy double door's got a sunkissed

1454
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,599
phenotype in california

1455
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,679
that finishes in like 55-60 days that

1456
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,960

1467
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,519
have a longer longer flowering season

1468
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,719
like okay in the caribbean like

1469
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:12,318

concentrate event

1481
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,358
where he was at we were all getting

1482
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:40,480
[ __ ] you know dab down

1483
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,000
that was a fun time probably the

1484
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,599
was the last time we all got to hang out

1485
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,599
together man yeah

1486
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,359
that was a lot of fun man [ __ ] steve

1487
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,079
is down there [ __ ] you know shout out

1488
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,558
his uh

1489
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,760
grown fishes podcast i've been listening

1490
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,519
quite a bit to that

1491
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,920
i gotta say man i'm really impressed

1492
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,119
with all that the information you know i

1493
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,559
passed that on to

1494
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,400
many people uh i'm pretty

1495
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,480
pretty excited man i've been promoting

1496
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
you got your podcast like a [ __ ]

1497
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,240
dude

1498
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:12,000
there's a lot of people who wanna

1499
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,719
use natural uh you know fish microbials

1500
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,599
to

1501
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,719
to power the farm so i'm pretty excited

1502
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,640
man

1503
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:19,759
that's awesome i turned off your camera

1504
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,879
because it was i turned off your camera

1505
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,319
because your wi-fi was killing you but

1506
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,920
you sound much better now

1507
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:25,920
you you've got a face for radio anyway

1508
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,240
brother

1509
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,200
i want to double down real quick

1510
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,118
hopefully steven

1511
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,879
you guys can hear me right now yeah we

1512
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,400
can only bro i want to double down on

1513
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,519
what he said about watching steve's

1514
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,440
content because even if

1515
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,280
you're not gonna grow with fishes you

1516
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,400
will definitely learn something watching

1517
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,880
steve's content

1518
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,800
i mean i've i've even adopted the whole

1519
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,280
dual root zone thing now like i've got

1520
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,800
my pots and trays full of hydroton

1521
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,319
the dude knows a lot he's very well

1522
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,400
educated never uh never

1523
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:55,519
misjudged dread i love it when i walk in

1524
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,039
with the dreads and people think i'm not

1525
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,639
gonna know [ __ ] and then i reschool them

1526
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,400
on their entire [ __ ] grow

1527
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,358
it's the funnest thing to do so you can

1528
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,358
learn a lot from my brother steve

1529
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,480
i appreciate it guys sorry about the dog

1530
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,838
there for a second but yeah i appreciate

1531
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,240
it that's family too bro the dog is

1532
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,880
family

1533
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,318
dog's on the show now the dog's famous

1534
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,680
but steve's probably gotten

1535
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,199
uh steve's probably got some of the

1536
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,199
highest level of actual education

1537
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,559
you know how do you deal with the

1538
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,639
moisture the amount of [ __ ] moisture

1539
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,400
that you deal with the uh the humidities

1540
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,000
that keep that going that you know

1541
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,838
you're constantly running

1542
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,920
fluid through you know how do you guys

1543
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,679
deal with that you know on an aquaponics

1544
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,119
level

1545
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:34,239
yeah i've molded up a house with just a

1546
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,039
fish tank so that's a pretty good

1547
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,879
question

1548
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,639
uh ross de bob said anything to the

1549
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,680
platinum tangy uh the orange gas

1550
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,199
or sunkist is great outdoors rasta bob

1551
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,960
also made a good point he said piranha

1552
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,598
is another one that could take it great

1553
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
outdoors

1554
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,640
uh that's absolutely absolutely true

1555
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
prana finishes early

1556
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,799
uh it's got blueberry and flow and a

1557
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,039
rise in it so it's potent it's vigorous

1558
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,079
uh but it's very limited in quantity on

1559
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,358
seeds i'm not sure where you'll be able

1560
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,280
to find it i've got a couple of packs

1561
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,558
left so good luck finding the prana

1562
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,640
but that one kills it outdoors

1563
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,720
definitely crushes

1564
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,838
yeah so with the uh with the humidity it

1565
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,838
generally makes it pretty easy to

1566
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,039
maintain vpd in a place like colorado

1567
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,838
where it's so dry

1568
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,358
but definitely can be an issue um at

1569
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:14,719
night time mainly so we do

1570
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,480
you know definitely have to make sure we

1571
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,439
have dehumidifiers or a good airflow at

1572
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,960
nighttime but that's

1573
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,240
fixing plus just proper pruning and

1574
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,599
making sure you have you know cultivars

1575
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:22,719
that are adapted to it and finally some

1576
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,000
phenos

1577
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,279
in your cultivars that you're looking

1578
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,719
for that are a little bit you know more

1579
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,680
more human tolerant

1580
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,519
you know trying to stick to more

1581
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,199
equatorial strains similarly growing in

1582
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,400
even in oklahoma is similar to right you

1583
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,480
have higher humidity

1584
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,920
or texas or anywhere on the gulf coast

1585
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,559
you could have higher humidity

1586
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,159
uh and you know or jamaica you guys are

1587
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,000
down in jamaica and trinity um

1588
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,399
uh you guys are very similar to growth

1589
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,159
in terms of humidity

1590
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,680
we'll see like i'm in santa cruz man i'm

1591
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:49,920
right on the coast literally we

1592
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,919
get a lot of ocean winds and a lot of uh

1593
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,440
you know a lot of that fog coming off

1594
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,039
the ocean and nights and stuff and we

1595
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,800
get you know tremendous amounts of

1596
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,159
humidity spikes at night and so there's

1597
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,160
a lot of people here trying to do the

1598
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,159
aquaponics thing at the same time

1599
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,920
uh you know any advice for people you

1600
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,719
know growing greenhouse that are trying

1601
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,039
to do this

1602
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,000
uh you know you know symbiotic in a kind

1603
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,440
of higher humidity

1604
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,480
environment other than you know i i know

1605
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,039
dehumidification is probably key to

1606
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,800
everything but you know uh you know just

1607
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,519
some simple advice to some of the people

1608
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,318
in the higher

1609
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,519
humidity environments so the other big

1610
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:22,880
thing i would say is going to be

1611
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,800
ultra critical and high humidity

1612
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
environments is relying heavily on

1613
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,920
geothermal

1614
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,440
over wet walls because geothermal will

1615
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,159
operate just fine in high humidity

1616
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,519
environments

1617
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,519
whereas wet walls are horribly

1618
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:33,920
inefficient in human humid environments

1619
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,920
so

1620
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,680
you know if you have cooler ground or

1621
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,400
even even better if you have a cool

1622
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,000
aquifer

1623
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,480
and you can pull like in jamaica for

1624
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,440
example underground it's still 70 72

1625
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,800
degrees right it's

1626
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,800
not that much cooler because it's the

1627
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,318
tropics but if you find an aquifer that

1628
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,839
aquifer is much cooler

1629
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,279
so if you can pull water up from

1630
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,119
underground and circulate that through

1631
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
either a heat exchanger attached to a

1632
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,160
wet wall

1633
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,000
to basically chill that wet wall or to

1634
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,358
have it attached directly to the slab or

1635
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
through a heat exchanger in your grill

1636
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:01,920
beds

1637
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,679
um for yourself you can actually you

1638
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,079
know do it that way to cool everything

1639
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,000
down

1640
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,920
and be very efficient even in a very

1641
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,599
human place like the caribbean

1642
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,760
hell yeah dude well one of the things

man uh i'll tell you what there's been

1688
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,079
more questions about aquaponics down

1689
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,000
here than you can imagine

1690
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,920
and i've had to answer so much [ __ ] and

1691
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,838
i just keep saying grow with fishes

1692
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,440
you need to check out the podcast

1693
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,719
because like if you really want to know

1694
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,679
how to do this this is

1695
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,439
how you're going to do it because

1696
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,118
symbiotic aquaponics is not something

1697
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,720
you just walk into it's a

1698
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,240
it's definitely a process that i think

1699
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,919
people need to understand the amount of

1700
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,318
bacteria you need to build up the amount

1701
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,880
of

1702
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:58,639
you know like uh to properly aquaponics

1703
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,400
i've been growing for like 12 years 20

1704
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,598
years 40 years i don't even know and

1705
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,119
aquaponics is like

1706
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,200
a completely different thing to me i

1707
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,640
don't know the first step about

1708
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,078
aquaponics like i would be if you're

1709
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:09,838
like send me up an aquaponics girl

we're going to talk about growing weed

1842
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,920
again real soon here this is getting

1843
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:38,960
not a question for steve actually i've

1844
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,280
seen the

1845
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,559
large-scale aquaponics setups that he's

1846
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,400
done firsthand

1847
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,720
what's the smallest you could possibly

1848
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,000
do could you do like a goldfish tank for

1849
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:51,838
dan's setup like so we the smallest i've

1850
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,440
actually grown anything on aquaponics

1851
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,358
about two and a half gallon tank i grew

1852
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,039
forehead the lettuce but as far as

1853
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,798
cannabis the smallest we were able to

1854
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,759
get a cannabis plant to grow

1855
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:03,920
with uh uh what would normally be

1856
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,880
considered an appropriate amount of fish

1857
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,000
and an aquarium was about 40 gallons um

1858
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,160
just in terms of

1859
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,239
it it takes so much biomass of fish to

1860
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:15,039
create enough biomass of

1861
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:18,558
fish manure yeah i think if you're using

1862
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:20,079
enough fertilizer 20 gallon guppy tank

1863
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,440
uh that was just packed to the brim you

1864
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,000
could probably make it work but you know

1865
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,159
i'm not going to tell people to do that

1866
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,599
yeah that'd be kind of unethical uh

1867
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:28,480
treatment of the guppies even though

1868
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,240
they are guppies

1869
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,318
but like i was just curious because like

1870
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,679
how could uh your average home grower or

1871
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,079
hobbyist grower

1872
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:36,719
adopt an aquaponic system so you could

1873
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,960
just take like

1874
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,798
fill in their garage full of fish sure

1875
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,920
so you could just take an over the flow

1876
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,358
overflow aquarium filter box

1877
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,880
you get for a saltwater aquarium or

1878
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:47,598
drill your tank if you're really into

1879
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,200
glass

1880
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,200
um but most people just buy an overflow

1881
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:54,078
tank run that down to your sub tank

1882
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,279
and then run a return pump to either up

1883
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,798
to your fish tank and then

1884
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,400
you either run a second pump for your

1885
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,079
flood and drain table or

1886
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,119
run that on a bell siphon or loop siphon

1887
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,798
so you don't you know everything can run

1888
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,079
continuously but yeah it's super simple

1889
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,039
you know i mean it's not a

1890
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,798
lot of work if you already have a grow

1891
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,318
tank grow tray and something it's

1892
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:09,838
literally like a trip to the

1893
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,039
saltwater fish store and you can have

1894
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:12,318
that up and running in about half an

1895
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,400
hour

1896
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,759
nice it's always thought it was way more

1897
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,200
than that

1898
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,640
oh yeah that's awesome man yeah i didn't

1899
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,759
know if you had to develop like quite a

1900
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:23,679
bit of culture before

1901
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,880
they started actually being efficient

1902
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,480
and you know

1903
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,160
how much you know bacteria you have to

1904
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,280
develop before that starts becoming you

1905
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:34,159
know a relevant

1906
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,440
uh feeding you know you know this fish

1907
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,199
the same way that you would cycle or

1908
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,720
make sure you're a good living soil bed

1909
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,558
same thing you do with the aquarium or

1910
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,239
an aquaponics system populating those

1911
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,760
microbes the same way we would when we

1912
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,719
inoculate our gardens in the springtime

1913
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,280
in our soil beds very similar

1914
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,719
okay oh yeah that's awesome man it's

1915

working on a seed cleaner on an electric

2339
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,840
seat cleaner

2340
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,480
i'm assuming that's what you're alluding

2341
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,520
to yes sir yes sir

2342
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:30,000
yeah i'm pretty excited about it it's uh

2343
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:31,040
handmade these hands so uh

2344
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,319
it's been a good time it's been a

2345
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:33,920
learning experience i've had to make a

2346
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,359
prototype or two and alter the

2347
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,079
the designs a little bit i'm happy with

2348
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:40,000
where where it is now i just have to put

2349
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:41,920
the final design together and i'll have

2350
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,920
prototype videos up and running

2351
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,840
um the model itself is very well proven

2352
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,199
it's actually open source so the only

2353
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,840
thing i'm really selling

2354
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,119
is not the model it's not a secret it's

2355
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,800
just my labor in parts

2356
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:57,198
that's that's the only reason for a

2357
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,239
market is my labor in parts

2358
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,559
so uh it's very time tested design it's

2359
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,359
really

2360
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,320
it's really cool they use it a lot in um

2361
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,479
bird breeding

2362
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,238
because they can't yeah they can't waste

2363
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,718
the food so they have to recover their

2364
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,879
costs from the seeds that the birds eat

2365
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,239
they have to clean that out of the seeds

2366
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,119
that they just spill

2367
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,439
so it's made for all size seeds because

2368
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:20,000
they

2369
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,039
they don't use one in particular seed

2370
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,520
it's always a mix

2371
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:24,800
so it works for all kinds of seeds and

2372
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,640
should be pretty cool i just got to dial

2373
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,840
it in a little bit

2374
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,960
it's a good product i've seen it and i

2375
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,719
know where the idea came from and i know

2376
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,840
the idea is solid so i hope you have

2377
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,439
great success with that bro

2378
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,480
uh when they're ready i'm definitely

2379
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:35,839
going to be looking at one i've got a

2380
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,039
seat cleaner now but you know i can

2381
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,480
always put them side by side and clean

2382
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:39,760
twice as many seeds

2383
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:41,359
appreciate it man thanks for letting me

2384
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,800
have a moment to talk about it oh yeah

2385
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,399
man gotta support the community here

2386
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,159
gotta support the community you guys if

2387
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,198
you're a if you're just a regular grower

2388
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:48,399
not just a regular girl i'm not trying

2389
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,000
to downplay a grower

2390
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:51,359
if you're a grower that's got a trim

2391
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,880
your version of trimming which you guys

2392
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:54,158
call trim gel which i find disrespectful

2393
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,359
to anybody that's been in real jail

2394
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:56,719
where you're listening to sublime eating

2395
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,719
cheetos quit saying trim jail

2396
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,760
but you guys that are in trim jail uh

2397
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,000
the breeders version

2398
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,679
is cleaning seeds and packing seeds uh

2399
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,439
that is our version we gotta get on

2400

2401
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,639
and have 12 bottles of water and just go

2402
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:10,319
to cleaning and packing seeds that's our

2403
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,320
version so that machine he's making

2404
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:13,840
is definitely useful helpful for

2405

01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:42,158
just saying i wanted to breed later like

2448
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,560
i have

2449
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,238
sts and uh i have pollen that i've

2450
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,320
collected and i made one cross

2451
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,319
that i'm testing now but i'm no breeder

2452
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,679
or anything like that

2453
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:53,920
yeah you're doing you're breeding you're

2454
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,520
making that's breeding

2455
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,920
otherwise you know yeah you're learning

2456
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,520
it um

2457
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,800
like i'm doing some open pollination

2458
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,360
right now i have some really awesome

2459
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,199
seeds i got in zimbabwe up in the hills

2460
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:06,559
uh some really cool sativas doing some

2461
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,000
open pollination with that to try and

2462
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,719
batch them out so we can give a bunch of

2463
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,479
them out

2464
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:14,560
do something cool you said cool sativas

2465
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,279
how how long are those flowering

2466
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,840
uh that's the million dollar question

2467
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:19,359
all right

2468
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,319
i'm really curious about some zimbabwe

2469
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:23,519
sativa i guess 12 weeks dog 12 weeks i'm

2470
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:27,519
going to say 16. i'm going to

2471
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,960
be 16. yeah 12 is pretty weak

2472
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:33,760
yeah yeah very ambitious guys

2473
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,198
i picked these uh earth or i guess

2474
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,480
they'd be late in the summer early in

2475
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:38,719
the fall their time so

2476
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,319
they actually would be equivalent to us

2477
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,198
would kind of be like early september

2478
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,519
finishers

2479
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,119
but we'll see i also have no idea when

2480
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,760
they were planted they i just happened

2481
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:47,439
to

2482
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,679
be in the right place at the right time

2483
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:51,198
and uh and get a you know a nice tour of

2484
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,719
a farm where i was going through and

2485
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:55,279
they were mature seeds so

2486
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,079
obviously uh you know paper planes found

2487
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,559
a way to follow

2488
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:59,920
yeah i love it i love it big respect for

2489
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,199
all the work you do moving genetics

2490
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,960
around that's the only way that i need

2491
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:06,158
to say that but big respect for it

2492
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,600
i appreciate that as a seed breeder and

2493
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,198
somebody trying to move seeds around i

2494
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,719
know your struggle brother definitely

2495
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,079
all right cass i saw you raise your hand

2496
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,520
and say that you're breeding some seeds

2497
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,719
so cascadian i'll give you a chance to

2498
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,400
talk about your breeding project if you

2499
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,399
want to go for it now oh dude

2500
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:19,679
i got a whole ball of wax i'm just

2501
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,719
getting ready to crack into

2502
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:26,158
i'm going back i'm going back in time

2503
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,760
not really i'm going to land race

2504
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,399
heirloom genetics and getting out of

2505
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,520
what i call the box which is

2506
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:36,879
camps diesels ogs all that's coming

2507
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,719
yeah i'm going back to to uh some land

2508
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,039
races and mixing

2509
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,560
particular land races with my

2510
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:46,238
environment in mind so

2511
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,920
i'm really focused on the

2512
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:51,839
pakistani and afghanis

2513
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,560
hindu kush and mixing that with

2514
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,560
himalayan

2515
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:00,480
genetics nepalese manapuri burma

2516
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:01,279
the really wet stuff so that i can get

2517
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:03,359
the yield

2518
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,679
and the hash from the hindus but the

2519
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,759
mold resistance and the structure from

2520
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,760
the himalayas and really nice you can

2521
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,000
know those from my area so

2522
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,600
many people so many people overlook the

2523
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,319
resistance part they just want instagram

2524
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,280
ability

2525
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:17,039
so i'm glad you're talking about

2526
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,399
resistance early on in your breeding

2527
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,679
instead of i'm going to find a phenotype

2528
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:22,319
that sells wheat on instagram

2529
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,920
that's what it's all about now nah man i

2530
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,639
want to breed for the future

2531
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,440
for the day with that the plant is set

2532
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,840
free and you can put it outside and

2533
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,039
we need to develop regional cultivars

2534
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,679
and and regional

2535
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,359
like genetic families it doesn't just

2536
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,119
need to be a single cultivar it needs to

2537
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,000
be interrelated families that are

2538
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:42,399
regional

2539
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,679
uh like appalachian style where they

2540
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,519
thrive in that environment

2541
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,960
and they might thrive in other

2542
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,239
environments but they're cultivated for

2543
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,319
that environment so that the day that

2544
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:52,000
the cuffs come off we

2545
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,359
we can just literally take our seeds and

2546
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,198
go outside and just

2547
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:56,719
throw them and they go we don't i've got

2548
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,719
mountain kush you've got your

2549
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,920
cascadian kush black sail's got his

2550
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,439
denver kush

2551
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,199
duck's got his caribbean kush we all

2552
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:04,079
just throw our acclimated perfect seeds

2553
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,839
out there yeah

2554
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,519
i can't wait for that that's what i'm

2555
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,480
breeding i'm reading for that world i'm

2556
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,239
i'm always looking

2557
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:12,000
10 steps ahead so i'm bringing for that

2558
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:12,799
world not the world we live in right now

2559
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,158
because this is a [ __ ]

2560
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,199
go back to the future you need that

2561
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:19,198
delorean it's where we're headed

2562
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,879
now we just named all of our subsequent

2563
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,399
crosses yeah we got the 88 miles per

2564
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,639
hour we got the dock we got the marty

2565
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:28,158
mcfly your c-line just named itself bro

2566
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:32,639
good job dave straight names are

2567
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:32,638
they already hungry from his lineup

2568
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,920
looks like rastabob is showing us some

2569
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:37,039
plants and i'm not even paying attention

2570
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,079
because i'm over here trying to pay

2571
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,079
attention to all this other stuff

2572
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:44,479
oh and then he cut out is that the

2573
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:47,760
chamber

2574
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,879
oh [ __ ] bob where are you man looking

2575

i was gonna say man some skinny

2577
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,079
skinny leaves yeah yeah that's going to

2578
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:57,439
be a long flower long finisher there but

2579
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,359
i bet the buzz is incredible

2580
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,039
i like that stuff that gives me like the

2581
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:02,479
shakes and the sweats and a panic

01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,960
wrote in the chat here that that's a

2598
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:36,158
land race running

2599
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:39,760
uh chamba he's going to cross it with

2600
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:49,839
some jamaican jamaican landers

2601
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:49,840
that's what we said he says

2602
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,359
that was rad i can't believe nobody else

2603
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,880
has any 420 plans i'm trying to weasel

2604
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,158
420 plans out of you guys so i can find

2605
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,359
something to do and nobody's got any

2606
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:13,039
plans

2607
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:16,238
on my couch we got the

01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,239
that's why i've actually always been

2656
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,719
interested in horticulture

2657
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:50,319
like unknowingly i was brought up with

2658
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:54,158
uh in my grandma's garden

2659
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:56,479
and she's man uh an insane grower she

2660
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:58,479
uh the the fruit that i would pick off

2661
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:01,119
those trees are just always so awesome

2662
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,879
so it's delicious it's just like oh the

2663
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,880
leave it alone method you know

2664
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,800
neglect those are the real growers for

2665
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,840
all the old school people

2666
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,320
yeah yeah uh learned a lot from her and

2667
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,920
uh

2668
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,679
learned a lot from just uh going to

2669
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,520
school and

2670
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,920
basically focusing on those things that

2671
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,639
i was interested in

2672
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,920
yeah and i actually got a great start

2673
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,119
from canada's organum

2674
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:28,239
i was looking more into biochemistry

2675
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,760
when i actually started growing so when

2676
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:32,479
i started growing i

2677
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,480
did get introduced to cannabis organim

2678
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,559
through embracing organics and just

2679
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:39,198
started following him uh

2680
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,280
cannabis organim at youtube great source

2681
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:42,879
of knowledge uh i really hope to see him

2682
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,039
come back online someday

2683
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,079
but with all the amount of i learned so

2684
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:48,840
much from you

2685
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,319
oh you shut him down or did he disappear

2686
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,960
voluntarily

2687
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:54,880
okay yeah yeah uh always a bunch of

2688
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:58,000

01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,800
i wish uh him much love just like stabby

2690
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,880
was saying

2691
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,560
there's so much knowledge you can learn

2692
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,199
from him he's the one that actually got

2693
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,320
me

2694
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:08,319

i got to hang out with him uh he took me

2696

just

2698
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,079
mushroom hunting no fancy work

2699
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,800
promotional hunting and

2700
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:19,039

2705
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,399

there

2720
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,679
at very least twice twice a year to

2721
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,920
collect

2722
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:59,119
mushroom tissue samples and spores

2723
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:02,399
to add to my own collection and just for

2724
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:03,279
my own little uh side projects i've been

2725
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,039
looking into

2726
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:10,479
like uh dna marking for

2727
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:12,399
local uh

2728
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,158
a lot of species in my area but

2729
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,079
specifically mushrooms

2730
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:17,599
so yeah uh going to be starting up that

2731
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:18,158
working with operation grow on some

2732
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,800
other stuff

2733
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,359
that will be connected to those stuff

2734
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,920
yeah

2735
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:25,759
i gave him an uh an invite but it's a

2736
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,199
little uh late for him it's

2737
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,960
right in the middle of his nap time yeah

2738
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:33,119
but he's uh he's a great source of

2739
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,800
knowledge uh i'm happy to be connected

2740
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:38,719
to his group as well

2741
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:41,279
they uh we do a lot we actually uh

2742
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,719
got to interview binocular university

2743
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:46,719
and he talked a little bit about

2744
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:48,960
yeah and uh he got to uh tell us about

2745
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,399
polyamorous chain reaction uh testing so

2746
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,880
that's just pcr testing

2747
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:53,839
and that's the whole uh how we're able

2748
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,880
to get

2749
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,520
no male and female before even flower

2750
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,679
happens

2751
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,280
right yeah like that are important also

2752
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,119
that goes into

2753
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,800
uh getting dna markers so that's what

2754
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:07,198
i'm going to be looking into so

2755
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,880
we'll be we'll be working on stuff like

2756
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:11,359
that in the very near future

2757
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,319
it's just a matter of uh saving up and

2758
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:14,238
doing

2759
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,920
uh a little bit of organization who's

2760
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:16,879
doing what uh how are we gonna

2761
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,440
accomplish this

2762
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:21,279
what sources are we gonna use so yeah

2763
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,919
it's it's gonna be a lot of fun

2764
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,679
and hopefully we can also share all the

2765
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:29,359
knowledge on the neighborhood grows

2766
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,840
we actually uh just like mr bagsy was

2767
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:32,079
saying

2768
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,920
gonna be starting off with introductory

2769
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:37,119
grows and just starting off

2770
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:41,440
from step one you know where

2771
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:41,439

2803
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,119
plants uh to see how they affect the

2804

2872
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,560
don't know because like you know

2873

i'm american so i feel like it doesn't

2874
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,120
apply to me

2875
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,319
are you worried about forest fires with

2876
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:57,040
those paper walls uh

2877
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:58,719
you know i mean uh honestly we have

2878
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:59,600
we've cut several fire roads we've got

2879
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,800
about 40 acres

2880
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,800
up here and we've got about six fire

2881
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,159
roads cut out all the brush has been

2882
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,159
cleared around our property as well as

2883
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:08,719
we put in a

2884
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,638
large water reservoirs that the fire

2885
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:14,000
department can directly tap into so our

2886
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,920
house is kind of on the more safer zone

2887
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,359
is there like a conch shell or maybe

2888
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,639
like a ram horn that you blow that

2889
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,839
summons all of the ninjas

2890
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,159
or do they just show up at a certain

2891
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,840
time for class every day well they show

2892
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:25,279
up they show up every two days they show

2893
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,039
up every [ __ ] two days and they do

2894
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:27,519
classes and it's [ __ ] awesome and new

2937
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,000
dried right at the time of 420 literally

2938

[ __ ] fog off the bed i was gifted

2990
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,679
i'm not going to go too deep into this

2991
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,319
but i was gifted some california spider

2992
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,239
mites

2993
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:31,679
bro those mendomites are the most

2994
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,559
voracious

2995
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,199
[ __ ] mites that i have ever dealt

2996
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,719
with

2997
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:38,158
uh shout out to the mendomites they

2998
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,359
didn't come from behind exactly from

2999
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:41,118
your neck of the woods

3000
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:43,039
but no i know exactly who gave them to

3001
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:43,920
you yeah don't go down that don't go

3002
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,000
down there

3003
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,039
i don't want to have to edit you but i'm

3004
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,118
not going to explain the name

3005
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:53,118
but those might work crazy yeah

3006
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:55,279
those cali mites were the worst never

3007
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:56,319
had mice like that they're probably

3008
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,399
you know what killed them you know we

3009
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,158
got rid of them colorado cold

3010
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,759
that's what did it like just get it

3011
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:02,719
super cold from the colorado cold and

3012
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,520
they were like i don't know what to do

3013
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:05,600
with this

3014
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,679
and like they stopped like yeah i ruined

3015
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,600
that [ __ ] fest for sure

3016
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,039
that's why that's why it's so important

3017
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,360
you hit them during veg that's why i

3018
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:12,960
tell

3019
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:14,399
everybody you know if you get cuts from

3020
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,960
people you don't know or you don't

3021
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:16,638
[ __ ]

3022
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:19,118
have if you aren't sure about their [ __ ]

3023
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,118
[ __ ] quarantine them shit's off

3024
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:22,399
all of the protocol but those those

3025
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:23,439
bites were

3026
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:24,879
they were just like yeah you thought we

3027
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,158
were gone and they just all ran out at

3028
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,279
one time and they'll give me the finger

3029
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:29,439
and like

3030
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:30,719
[ __ ] you i'm flipping you off so hard

3031
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:32,479
right now and then they just ran away

3032
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,920
and i tried to hit them with pesticides

3033
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:36,638
they just laughed at me dude they were

3034
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,239
vegeta did you dip the clones in soft

3035
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,118
oil x it seems to be about the only

3036
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:42,399
thing that works

3037
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,839
for getting ready for me

3038
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,519
i don't have that because it just feels

3039
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,079
like it's more uh

3040
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,600
more harsh than i'm ready for but i'll

3041
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:51,118
try it it's probably like a canola some

3042
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,880
sort of a white oil with a wetting agent

3043
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:56,158
or something in there i may do that

3044
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:57,920
but a dip is a good idea yeah i dip

3045
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,079
all my clones if it's coming in from off

3046
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,239
property it gets dipped

3047
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:04,319
i don't care if i have to to to take a

3048
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,479
rooted clone and reroute it

3049
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,840
it's not worth the bio security of me

3050
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,519
you know risking the facility

3051
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,520
yeah it did slow me down quite a bit to

3052
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,960
be honest with you it definitely uh that

3053
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,880
and another thing that i adjusted

3054
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,039
another learning curve got me it's

3055
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,800
really cramping your style i'm sure

3056
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:20,399
yeah just be sure to tell people that

3057
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,679
didn't come from my goddamn garden

3058
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,960
you know what i'm saying they're ninja

3059
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,039
mites bro it's already obvious where

3060
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:31,118
they came from they're ninja mites

3061
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:31,118
and we all know ninja

3062
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:37,520
[Laughter]

3063
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:00,960
that i'll never use again trust me i

3064
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:02,000
didn't know what i was doing remember

3065
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,960
when we were knew when you'd go to the

3066
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,719
grocery store and you'd be like i have

3067
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,118
mice they'd go here go spray this all

3068
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,639
over your crop

3069
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:09,599
and then you'd get like a wig blister on

3070
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,239
your arm and you're like i wonder what

3071
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,600
that's from

3072
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,519
like it could have been the pesticides

3073
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,560
but i hit these plants with this product

3074
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,000
one time we're not going to talk about

3075
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,760
what it was because [ __ ] me for doing it

3076
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,039
i know better now i shame on me forever

3077
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,239
using that i didn't know better

3078
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,158
[ __ ] the guy at the groce store is what

3079
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:23,359
we got to do but i use this product and

3080
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:25,599
i came in the next day

3081
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:27,359
and the spider mites were dead but they

3082
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,480
were repelling from the plants they

3083
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:29,679
looked like they were like

3084
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:31,039
what do we do i'm out of here and they

3085
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,239
just threw a [ __ ] web and rappelled

3086
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:33,679
from the leaves like cliffhanger and

3087
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:35,118
they just died swinging there

3088
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,199
just a bunch of mites swinging in the

3089
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,719
[ __ ] fan dead as [ __ ]

3090
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,079
that was it was a neat thing to see but

3091
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,560
oh my god i'll never use that product

3092
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:42,000
again

3093
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,440

but watching those bugs they're just

3097
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,000

everyone wanted to trash their grows

3103
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,960
like what was that

3104
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,960
one

3105
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,279
these guys lied and said that their

3106
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,920
product was organic but there was other

3107
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:07,198
stuff hidden

3108
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,480
in the product that they weren't

3109
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:10,158
claiming so people were failing

3110
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:12,399
pesticide tests

3111
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:13,839
uh i went on a podcast episode and i

3112
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:15,439
talked about it and i said hey

3113
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,960

3114

3116
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:21,039
and they never did

3117
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,880
like i'm sure they heard it because

3118
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:24,479
somebody had to plant the country

3119
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,319
remember that's funny no i don't

3120
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:27,759

3121
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:29,840
i'm so busy doing a podcast i don't

3123
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,440
don't have time bro

3124
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,760
oh i know half of colorado dunks in the

3125
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:36,079
eagle 21 so that's why i mentioned that

3126
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,719
one

3127
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,319
that was the number one yeah eagle 20 is

3128
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,480
banned in every commercial

3129
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:45,039
[ __ ] facility now that's just gone

3130
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:46,079
yeah uh it burns off into cyanide gas or

3131
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,399
something so

3132
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:49,840
yeah can't have that around and if you

3133
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,000
need that you went too hard on something

3134
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:54,480
anyway buy a dehumidifier

3135
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,639
yeah no i'm with you man i just watched

3136
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,319
facilities do man it's not i can know i

3137
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,920
don't get donated at all it's just one

3138
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:02,238
of those things where it's like

3139
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,480
[ __ ] man now they've got technology uh

3140
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:06,000
they come in and they swab the walls

3141
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,599
and they can tell you what pesticides

3142
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,719
have been used for like the past two or

3143
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,480
three years

3144
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,158
and if they detect an illegal pesticide

3145
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:14,238
in there from years ago

3146
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:15,198
years ago uh if anybody gets that one

3147
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,279
that's funny um

3148
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:18,960
years ago they get your pesticides from

3149
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:20,238
years ago they'll shut you down and

3150
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,520
kill the crop that you've got and it's

3151
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:22,638
all lost you got to kill everything and

3152
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,080
start fresh

3153
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,520
so yeah you gotta be careful with what

3154
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:26,800
they sprayed in there the previous

3155
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,320
owners could have sprayed something and

3156
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,279
i bought that facility and now

3157
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:30,559
they come in and they test it and

3158
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:32,319
they're like no we found a midi culprit

3159
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,320
in the wall and you're like ah [ __ ]

3160
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:36,000
like document when you found that so

3161
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:38,639
that we can kill everything before that

3162
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,639
start fresh

3163
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:42,639
i found some super uh differences being

3164
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,159
in colorado and

3165
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,400
uh california as far as like the

3166
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:48,079
dispensary goes experience

3167
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,519
uh you hear they don't give you three

3168
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:51,359
stickers they don't check your id

3169
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,040
three times it almost feels illegal the

3170
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:54,479
way they do here you [ __ ] walk into a

3171
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,000
dispensary they just take your [ __ ]

3172
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:57,118
money and hand you weed they don't give

3173
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,319
a [ __ ] they don't give you just

3174
01:41:57,118 --> 01:41:59,759

3282
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:32,399
420 is kind of uh six months roughly

3284

stone or thanksgiving it's something

3288
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,719
that i kind of started after we used to

3289
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:42,559
do a 420 party back in

3290
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,319
philadelphia and we were always super

3291
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,080
hungry afterwards so one year i just got

3292
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:47,840
the idea hey i'm going to cook a turkey

3293
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:49,679
and we kind of turned into this huge

3294
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,279
potluck that we had each year does

3295
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,239
anybody else kind of do a friend's

3296
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:56,079
gathering kind of thing like that

3297
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,479
no but now that i'm doing this camping

3298
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:00,639
trip i may start doing that [ __ ] hell

3299
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,000
that sounds good can i get stone to eat

3300
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,880
a bunch of [ __ ] rice it's going to be

3301
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,639
miserable

3302
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,880
i kind of went the other way i kind of

3303
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,880
um that's why i didn't share so i

3304
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:13,039
usually reserve that day for myself

3305
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:14,880
um it's one of

3306
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:16,479
two or maybe three days out of the year

3307
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:19,440
that i'd take and i just

3308
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,959
it's mine um i'm pretty greedy with it

3309
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,519
that's

3310
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,359
so i kind of went the other way i i take

3311
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,639
my flowers and i do what i want to do

3312
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:30,238
it's usually me and my dog and we go

3313
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:32,480
getting lost in the woods or we go find

3314
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:34,158
a lake or we go

3315
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:35,678
it's just usually for me because the

3316
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:37,118
rest of my life is so everybody

3317
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:38,880
everybody everybody that's

3318
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,039
i take that day for me so i kind of went

3319
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,400
the other way i can totally see why you

3320
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:43,920
would go do friends living

3321
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:47,039
friendsgiving and stuff that's beautiful

3322
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,199
but i went the other way personally

3323
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,880
no that's that's really great that's

3324
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:54,960

3345
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,439

3346
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,719
people when we get bob on uh with that

3347

01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,600
you're ready

3355
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,960
that's how good the uh ganja is over

3356
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,800
there this smoke

3357
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,480
you know really interferes with all that

3358
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:55,520
connection it's uh

3359
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:55,519
yeah that chalice

3360
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,199
i saw something online i saw something

3361
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,399
online that made me feel weird inside

3362
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,638
when i read it

3363
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:05,759
somebody had a plant outside and it was

3364
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,039
going to go into flower

3365
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,360
and they said how do i stop this from

3366
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:10,800
going into flower we recommended

3367
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,559
put a little led light over it right

3368
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:16,000
that way it doesn't go into flower

3369
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:18,960
they asked they seriously asked

3370
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,800
will the wind outside blow the light

3371
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,239
away from the flower

3372
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,400
keith is cracking up you've seen this

3373
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,359
too as a white guy you shared it with us

3374
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:27,439
the guy drew a

3375
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:28,399
[ __ ] picture with like the light

3376
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,839
beams coming down

3377
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:33,839
the wind like coming through and hitting

3378
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,840
them

3379
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:41,198
if you want better efficiency in your

3380
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:44,639
growth for your lights just put a fan up

3381
01:48:41,198 --> 01:48:44,638
top and just blow the light around

3382
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,840
i always wondered i was wondering doing

3383
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,719
this the whole time don't you guys

3384
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,279
understand that

3385
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,719
that light is photons i mean come on i

3386
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,319
don't know

3387
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:02,079
i know i want two of whatever

3388
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:03,279
why the guys would have the fans blowing

3389
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:04,639
on their plants like that because you

3390
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:06,000
always see the plants like shaking in

3391
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,079
the wind i'm like

3392
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,520
that's not healthy right but if you

3393
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:12,399
gotta blow all the light

3394
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,159
onto the plant then that man it's just

3395
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:15,839
mind-blowing dude i can't believe it i

3396
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:19,839
just

3397
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:23,119
started talking when you started talking

3398
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,560
i assumed they meant like blowing the

3399
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,759
light

3400
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,000
itself away like the unit not the light

3401
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,800
that's

3402
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,560
being that's what i was like oh i guess

3403
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,639
i guess if it's a lightweight the wind

3404
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:38,239
because what if it's hanging

3405
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:41,118
like i was like

3406
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:42,479
is that what for the sake of humanity i

3407
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,559
wish that's what they were asking but

3408
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:48,718
this person truly thought that the

3409
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,719
lumens or the whatevers the jewels

3410
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:53,039
the photons were going to get blown away

3411
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:56,559
is this person from hey i'm not going

3412
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:57,840
which part of

3413
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,000
wherever i'm not even going to say a

3414
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,800
place but yeah we need to protect this

3415
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,520
person they

3416
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:05,039
they're a jewel to society we we very

3417
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:11,840
rarely come from

3418
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:11,840
this right it could be a great museum

3419
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,520
yeah so you guys when you put your

3420
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,000
lights outside put up a windscreen to

3421
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,920
prevent

3422
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,359
the [ __ ] lumens from being stolen by

3423
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,000
by the way

3424
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:24,399
so you know the whole like single photon

3425
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,079
slit

3426
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:27,439
experiment where you get like different

3427
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:28,960
scatter patterns

3428
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,960
i always wondered if you took like a

3429
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:33,520
grid pattern that was like really

3430
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,198
microscopic and put it as like a

3431
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,880
a filter on your light if you could get

3432
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:37,759
a bigger scatter pattern with the

3433
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,359
photons

3434
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:43,199
anyways just on like a total nerd thing

3435
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:44,960
i wish i understood enough that to

3436
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:45,759
understand any of that the double slit

3437
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,760
experiment yeah

3438
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:49,840
like a micro light diffuser that's

3439
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,520
that's the concept of a light diffuser

3440
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:56,880
um in a in like a commercial setting

3441
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,400
they have the lights warehouse oh yeah

3442
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,599
i'm just talking about between the light

3443
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:01,279
and the actual thing anyways

3444
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:03,760
it's totally just like stupid proof of

3445
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:04,158
concept like a magnifying glass will

3446
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,520
burn

3447
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:06,879
it'll help make the light more intense

3448
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,320
to burn my leaves why can't we put a

3449
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,000
special shape of lids on there to give

3450
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:11,759
us i see where you're going bro

3451
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,359
something the same idea just a bunch of

3452
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,719
little magnifying glasses that are just

3453
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:15,679
enough to make it better but not enough

3454
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:18,239
to burn

3455
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,158
any lens that you put on top of the led

3456
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,479
actually is a decrease in efficiency

3457
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,238
whether you use a 90 degree lens or any

3458
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:25,198
other sort of lenses that you see that

3459
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,879
aftermarket

3460
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:31,039
a lot of companies use but they all uh

3461
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,000
they equal inefficiency in the

3462
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:35,039
transmission of

3463
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,359
ppfd to the canopy so yeah you

3464
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:38,158
the best way is to have nothing between

3465
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:40,639
the led

3466
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:41,359
and your plants well yeah like it has to

3467
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,880
bounce

3468
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:47,279
to get through there turn down the damn

3469
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,520
leds because my plants didn't like 100

3470
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:51,279
i was amazed they wanted like uh closer

3471
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:52,880
to 50 to introduce them they had to

3472
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:55,439
adjust for a while my plants were kind

3473
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,440
of mad at me

3474
01:51:56,079 --> 01:51:59,760
i got a phantom led right now i had to

3475
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,279
run it at 60 percent because

3476
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,880
anything over that i started yellow

3477
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:04,479
leaves and started getting to curl their

3478
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,079
tips up and i was like ah

3479
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:07,759
you [ __ ] [ __ ] and even if you

3480
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:08,960
pulled them off what you thought with an

3481
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:11,840
hbs would work

3482
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:13,359
at about 60 it would work very well but

3483
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,360
any more than 60

3484
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,759
it was just [ __ ] curling up leaves

3485
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:20,079
and making them not happy

3486
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,599
i don't know i had yellow on me they

3487
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:25,359
were it was just like hey that's too

3488
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,360
much light i'm gonna go yellow fast

3489
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,960
but i've learned and that's and i i'm

3490
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,239
[ __ ] excited about learning i was

3491
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,719
like oh they're going yellow what do i

3492
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:32,079
do

3493
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:33,599
like i always know what to do in the

3494
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:33,920
grove and i walked in i was like oh this

3495
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,520
is

3496
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,359
kind of exciting to see if i can fix

3497
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,639
them and bring them out of this crap

3498
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:39,759
yeah i haven't had to do that in a while

3499
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,560
since i worked at this one commercial

3500
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,079
girl where

3501
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,360
i felt like a couple of guys were just

3502
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:44,639
purposely trying to throw wrenches in

3503
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:47,839
the works every day

3504
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,840
to walk in and find out what they did

3505
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,440
yeah i kind of wonder like what you guys

3506
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,920
do with hid lights that

3507
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:55,919
you can't just like raise and dim um

3508
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:59,279
because

3509
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:02,319
like if you are giving a plant

3510
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:03,439
you know 18 hours of light in veg and

3511
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:07,439
then you cut it down

3512
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:11,598
you know 33 to 12 hours for flower um

3513
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:14,238
you know that's 33 less light every day

3514
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,360
so like to give them the same intensity

3515
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:18,479
and veg and flower

3516
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:20,399
like is definitely not optimal

3517
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:22,000
well generally you'd run a much lower

3518
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:24,559
wattage or you wouldn't run

3519
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,118
hids in bed anyway you would probably

3520
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:30,239
switch to hids once you hit flower

3521
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:30,559
for the most part you know 315's uh cmh

3522
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:32,638
are

3523
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,880
kind of the popular veggies like right

3524
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,159
now but running hids in general like you

3525
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,159
would not want to just run

3526
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:39,279
like straight up hids and then try to go

3527
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:41,039
into flower from there

3528
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:42,238
but the 12 12 photo period that's how

3529
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:43,760
plants work and they're naturally going

3530
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:45,759
to want to work on that photo period of

3531
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,560
12 12. so when you reduce that light

3532
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:50,400
it's just changing how they permit uh

3533
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,080
the hormones that are in the plant to

3534
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:54,879
switch into flowers it's not a matter of

3535
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:57,198
reducing how much light is getting and

3536
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:59,039
photosynthesis it needs that to switch

3537
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:01,198
into that photo period

3538
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,399
but i would i would say when you veg

3539
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:04,879
with hid

3540
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:06,399
it's really easy to use the lux meter

3541
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,440
and use numbers and

3542
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:11,359
yeah and vegetable and but it is getting

3543
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:14,799
less light but in for you

3544
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:17,839
it's it's a lot higher of a

3545
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:21,039
light intensity than it is in veg

3546
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:23,760
so um

3547
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:24,479
okay i had a learning curve where it was

3548
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,159
like

3549
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:27,598
clearly getting too much light but you

3550
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:29,920
know i was like oh it's pretty high up

3551
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,400
okay i have i had them on

3552
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,599
full blast because it's just kind of

3553
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:36,879
what we do

3554
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,880
yeah put it

3555
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:43,280
yes it was just like okay no

3556
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:44,238
yeah i had the same learning curve and

3557
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:47,759
um

3558
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:51,919
it's getting less light time

3559
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,960
it's getting more than delivered

3560
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,920
i'm gonna kill your camera brother

3561
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,198
because you're kind of cutting out but

3562
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,679
we'll keep your audio going we're gonna

3563
01:54:55,198 --> 01:55:00,799
stop your video for you

3564
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:01,840
i got you yeah yeah you sound much

3565
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:05,199
better now

3566
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:08,800
yeah much better um you're saying

3567
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:12,719
sweet but so

3568
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:15,119
it gets less light in

3569
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,118
flower

3570
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,079
it also gets about double a little more

3571
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:23,439
than double the intensity

3572
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:27,679
um i would go from about 20 lux

3573
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:32,479
to 60

3574
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:35,920
60 depending on the cultivar um

3575
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:37,118
so it is getting more light energy in

3576
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,359
flower

3577
01:55:37,118 --> 01:55:41,359
um even with the radius

3578
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:46,639
oh he's cutting out a lot i'm gonna

3579
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:48,639
interrupt him a lot um i've noticed that

3580
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:50,239
i can definitely reduce the amount of

3581
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:52,159
hours i run my lights with the leds

3582
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:54,079
compared to when i was running the hps's

3583
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:55,839
i used to run 20 on and five off because

3584
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:57,279
i keep mother plants for breeding

3585
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,880
and i like to keep them growing but

3586
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:00,319
definitely not going into flower

3587
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,239
and i want to producing a lot of clones

3588
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:03,759
for me i was able to put the veg room

3589
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:05,279
down to 18-6

3590
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,960
and i don't see any plants trying to

3591
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:08,719
flower early

3592
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,000
and i noticed they start drooping later

3593
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:11,039
in the day which tells me they've gotten

3594
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,118
enough light they're tired they're

3595
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,800
sleepy they're ready to take a nap

3596
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:16,719
so yeah i'm definitely running less

3597
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,400
light hours and i've got

3598
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,560
the leds i thought that they went that

3599
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:21,359
that knob went 100 to zero percent but

3600
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,960
it's like

3601
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:24,238
uh it's different so i even turned them

3602
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,520
down further than i thought i had them

3603
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:27,519
i've got them less than 50

3604
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,800
right now and i've gone maybe too close

3605
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,239
together but my clients are loving it

3606
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:33,039
now that i kind of figured it out

3607
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:34,158
uh i get the less hours less intensity

3608
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:35,519
it feels like if you're giving them the

3609
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:36,319
right light they don't need nearly as

3610
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,480
much of it

3611
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:40,000
and they're just they're beasting out

3612
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:40,319
and i think environment plays a lot in

3613
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,840
that

3614
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:44,079
light uh you know there's guys who run

3615
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,480
11 13 i think even durham and dan before

3616
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:47,118
did an

3617
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:48,479
uh uh episode of embracing organics

3618
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:49,039
where they were talking about doing 11

3619
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:51,118
13

3620
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:53,039
is versus the 12 12 just to reduce you

3621
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:54,079
know the overall monthly light bill but

3622
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:55,599
you can still achieve

3623
01:56:54,079 --> 01:56:57,920
some of the same goals maybe with a

3624
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:00,079
higher tdg ratio uh

3625
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,920
giving them more dark to light um but

3626
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:02,559
just also reducing you know one hour a

3627
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,359
day

3628
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,880
uh and light cycle so there's definitely

3629
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:08,158
room to play with these photo period

3630
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,199
plants and i think if

3631
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:13,198
uh you know i don't know if you're if

3632
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:15,678
you're worried about like some of the

3633
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:17,439
uh differences between the switching and

3634
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:18,960
transition you know that's part of why

3635
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:20,479
like there is that transition period

3636
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,639
where they say you know like

3637
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:24,238
uh you know going from flower to you

3638
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,760
know going from veg to flower you

3639
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:26,559
probably gotta you know a couple days

3640
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,719
before they start

3641
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:30,000
start to really take that photo period

3642
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:31,679
you know before they start to show that

3643
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,479
they're starting those signs you'll even

3644
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,319
notice that they

3645
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,678
they have that veg cycle down even if

3646
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:37,198
you're running in eighteen six they'll

3647
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,319
still assume that for the first three to

3648
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:40,000
five days

3649
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,679
even in your flowers like when you first

3650
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,479
switch them it's just how photoperiod

3651
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,639
work

3652
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:45,759
and uh reducing them to that isn't going

3653
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,840
to affect them so much

3654
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,079
if you're still maintaining the same

3655
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,520
kind of intensity or if you run into hid

3656
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:54,719
from t5s

3657
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:56,639
that's just how we've always ran

3658
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:58,480
one thing i've noticed for sure is that

3659
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:00,400
the batch of seeds i made under led

3660
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:02,238
lights have the best germination rate of

3661
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:03,920
any seeds i've ever made

3662
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:05,279
that's that's something i can for sure

3663
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,118
say these seeds are

3664
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:08,158
like all these packs are sealed right

3665
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:09,920
dump it up dump them out and show you to

3666
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,439
look at vacuum sealed these packs so

3667
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,480
i can't show you sorry and if you get

3668
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:13,598
them you're mad that they're sealed

3669
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:14,559
don't complain they're sealed you know

3670
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:16,079
they're tamper free

3671
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,679
i've had a couple people be like bro i

3672
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:18,960
tried for an hour to get that open

3673
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,800
it's not my fault you need a helmet and

3674
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,639
velcro shoes it's just a [ __ ] heat

3675
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,960
seal you can get it open

3676
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:24,960
come on

3677
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:30,800
with those things i really

3678
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:32,238
i'd love to hear steve's view on you

3679
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,679
know light cycles and stuff because you

3680
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:35,198
know he bases a lot of his stuff

3681
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:37,279
especially greenhouse work and stuff

3682
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:39,039
like that based on the season cycles and

3683
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:40,800
life cycles of the region

3684
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:42,479
so i'd definitely like to hear you know

3685
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:44,480
maybe how he bases a lot more

3686
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:46,399
when he starts seasons and you know

3687
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:48,238
based on his area of you know

3688
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:49,839
where he thinks uh you know different

3689
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:51,598
parts of the year are better for certain

3690
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,880
areas i would love to hear kind of some

3691
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:54,239
of the light seasons that he's

3692
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,679
experienced

3693
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:57,598
if i'm going to transition something

3694
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,319
outdoors i try to get within an hour of

3695
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,960
what it's going to

3696
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:02,639
transition into generally they won't

3697
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,118
pout too much within about an hour hour

3698
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:05,440
and a half

3699
01:59:03,118 --> 01:59:06,719
difference when you get past that they

3700
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:08,559
really start pouting

3701
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,319
and you might have a bit of a slow down

3702
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,599
period where it kind of was curious if

3703
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:12,639
it wants to go to flower and it'll go

3704
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,199
back to veg

3705
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:16,000
most of the time or you know just hang a

3706
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:18,799
couple of

3707
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,599
obnoxious uh you know like you go to the

3708
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,199
walmart

3709
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:23,039
or lowe's or any of these other box

3710
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:25,118
stores after christmas

3711
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:26,880
they always have those like regular leds

3712
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:27,598
and then the obnoxiously bright white

3713
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,599
ones right

3714
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:31,199
those obnoxiously bright white ones are

3715
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:32,480
great for just throwing over your plants

3716
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,000
for two hours

3717
01:59:32,479 --> 01:59:35,519
just to give them that extra day you

3718
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,198
know on your outdoor there's

3719
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,159
i mean they're still useful for

3720
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:38,719
something and you can get them on

3721
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:40,158
clearance

3722
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,520
you know after christmas and oftentimes

3723
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:42,000
this time of year they're discounted

3724
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,320
because

3725
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,599
they're not they're not moving so that's

3726
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:47,439
definitely something else that

3727
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,719
you know i like to do now i i will say

3728
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:50,158
too on the other direction that i've

3729
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,480
seen quite a bit of different cultivars

3730
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:54,960
particularly in the cbd cultivars

3731
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:56,399
throw um male flowers if they're kept

3732
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,679
under 24 hours of

3733
01:59:56,399 --> 02:00:01,439
of daylight even in veg well they'd be

3734
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:02,079
beautiful beautiful looking female

3735
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,238
flowers

3736
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,760
but in in each node there's one to four

3737
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:07,198
little tiny flowers that are you know

3738
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,280
occasionally throwing pollen

3739
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,279
now if i drop those same same exact

3740
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:14,158
plants down to 186

3741
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:15,920
they stopped doing that now the only

3742
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:17,679
difference that i've changed on those in

3743
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,279
that particular grow was the lights

3744
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:21,118
nothing else changed no nutrients no

3745
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:22,719
temperature no that was the only thing

3746
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:23,039
and it was the jamaican lion lions and

3747
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,520
the

3748
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:27,599
the ac dc lines were the two that that

3749
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,920
were showing that particular expression

3750
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,360
and

3751
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:30,960
i just attributed it to being you know

3752
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:31,598
something to do with cbd because cbd in

3753
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,800
particular is

3754
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,800
fairly pigeonholed genetic

3755
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:38,719
well pretty much too there's only a few

3756
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:39,839
places in the world where there's 24

3757
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:41,760
hour light you know you have the reuter

3758
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,159
wallace in russia and you have alaska

3759
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,159
there are

3760
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:45,759
places where it does the 24-hour

3761
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:46,399
situation why i imagine a lot of the

3762
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,719
photoperiod

3763
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:49,598
plants are not prepared honestly for

3764
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:52,000
yeah that kind of

3765
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:53,360
anyway so it makes sense that that would

3766
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,880
be the case

3767
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,719
i think plants are just like humans if

3768
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,400
you keep us awake for 24 hours

3769
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,158
for a long period of time we go crazy

3770
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:00,638
plants do that too they have hormones

3771
02:01:00,158 --> 02:01:02,638
that

3772
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:04,000
have to be produced at nighttime and if

3773
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,079
they don't have a sleep cycle

3774
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,118
it chemically has a hard time producing

3775
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:09,359
certain compounds

3776
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:10,799
and i'm sure it would negatively impact

3777
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:11,839
the immune system of the plant as well i

3778
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,480
mean that would probably be the first

3779
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,480
thing to suffer

3780
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,480
when you're thinking about putting them

3781
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,920
outside and trying to match the uh

3782
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:21,519
the daylight hours of outside sorry my

3783
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,239
brain could think work daylight hours uh

3784
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,520
when you're trying to match those

3785
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:25,118
daylight hours are you thinking about

3786
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,159
the uh the far red light that the sun's

3787
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:28,639
putting off as it goes down are you

3788
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:30,638
compensating for any of that

3789
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:32,000
i've never worried about that the only

3790
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:33,118
time i've ever tried to worry about that

3791
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,238
is if i was trying to make them go to

3792
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:36,799
sleep faster

3793
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:37,839
um the phytochrome uh you know when you

3794
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,039
with the far red triggers that

3795
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,560
phytochrome and the leaves and

3796
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:42,158
and it helps put the plants to sleep and

3797
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,560
i've seen quite a bit of data that shows

3798
02:01:42,158 --> 02:01:43,598
that

3799
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:45,199
you know it does make a pretty

3800
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:46,560
significant difference you can even eke

3801
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:47,678
out you know extra half hour an hour

3802
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,280
with your lights on

3803
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:50,960
um if you're really trying to push

3804
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:52,079
numbers and still have that same sleep

3805
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,679
period as far as

3806
02:01:52,079 --> 02:01:55,118
you know that hormone build up to

3807
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:56,560
actually make the plants fully you know

3808
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,880
have that full sleep cycle

3809
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,320
so definitely uh definitely something

3810
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:02,000
that you can play with a little bit but

3811
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:03,359
i haven't done anything on the outdoor

3812
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,639
i'll be honest with you on all the the

3813
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:05,598
bigger stuff that i've done the last

3814
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,199
three years

3815
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,119
including africa we had a greenhouse

3816
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:11,279
facility that was basically the nursery

3817
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:12,158
that cranked out all the production

3818
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:13,679
plants

3819
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,039
and we did a couple of testers in there

3820
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:16,480
and stuff like that maybe had a you know

3821
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:17,920
two or three flowering rooms and then

3822
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:19,759
everything else was just mass produced

3823
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:21,199
for the fields right so once we figured

3824
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,560
out that which cultivars were going to

3825
02:02:21,198 --> 02:02:24,719
give us really good production

3826
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,320
we were cloning that out and again the

3827
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:27,920
consistency of production that you get

3828
02:02:26,319 --> 02:02:29,439
from clones still beats the living

3829
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,199
daylights out of seed you know

3830
02:02:29,439 --> 02:02:32,479
um uh you know you need you need to have

3831
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:34,158
that if you're really going to have now

3832
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,198
i do think that you know in another few

3833
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:36,158
years they'll get the genetics

3834
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:37,678
stabilized but

3835
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:39,198
um certainly not with autos but

3836
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,760
definitely with and

3837
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:43,519
you know less or so with photos they're

3838
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,960
just not stable enough to have mass seed

3839
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:47,599
batches that are that

3840
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,039
you know over ten thousand or fifty or a

3841
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,639
hundred thousand seeds

3842
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:52,399
that are you know that predictable of a

3843
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:54,480
key mars the kingdom of our

3844
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:55,679
stability it just doesn't exist and who

3845
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:57,198
knows if we'll ever be able to achieve

3846
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,880
that i mean just look at apple trees

3847
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:00,879
they've never achieved that genetically

3848
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,920
ever to be able to have i mean if you

3849
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:04,000
take an apple

3850
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,840
uh an apple tree every single seed of

3851
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,520
that apple tree is a different pheno

3852
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,360
that's why johnny appleseed was able to

3853
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:10,960
have so many different strains named

3854
02:03:09,359 --> 02:03:12,960
after him and contributed him is because

3855
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,960
he planted more phenos than anyone else

3856
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:16,639
did that's awesome

3857
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,000
how much knowledge you bring brother we

3858
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:19,440
have a better chance of doing it with

3859
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,920
cannabis than we do with appleseed

3860
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:21,839
though

3861
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,118
oh yeah wait way better chance for sure

3862
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,480
yeah i don't mean to say we can't i'm

3863
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:26,559
just saying that yeah much shorter

3864
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:27,919
we're quite a few years off i hate to

3865
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,520
interrupt you gentlemen but uh we had

3866
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:31,118
another lady join the group we gotta

3867
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:32,960
take a moment to welcome the lady uh

3868
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:34,079
cass popped in i'm gonna give her a

3869
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:35,359
minute to tell us where she's from

3870
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:36,559
because that has been the custom

3871
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:39,839
cass where are you joining us from

3872
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:42,960
tonight cheers from texas

3873
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:45,039
i kind of felt that coming

3874
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,480
coming um i'm not sure if you want

3875
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:47,760
people stalking you on social media but

3876
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:50,078
i usually give people

3877
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:51,440
a chance to tell us their social media

3878
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:53,198
uh tell them how they can find you or

3879
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:54,839
your business online if you want to or

3880
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:56,158
you could tell me to not do that if you

3881
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:58,319
want

3882
02:03:56,158 --> 02:03:59,839
i will say steve uh one thing that i

3883
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:01,359
heard from a botanist is kind of scary

3884
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,078
she got interrupted and went silent

3885
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:03,519
sorry cass

3886
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:05,920
they talked right over your in your

3887
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:08,320
intro follow cassie guys if you know how

3888
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:11,199
to follow cass follow her

3889
02:04:08,319 --> 02:04:12,880
go ahead bro what are you saying i would

3890
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:13,519
say one thing that i've heard from a

3891
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,279
botanist

3892
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:19,119
is that uh they would like to unicrop

3893
02:04:17,279 --> 02:04:21,359
cannabis in the same way that they have

3894
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,598
done tomatoes and potatoes in our

3895
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:24,559
uh and our in our grocery stores to

3896
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:27,039
where it's very much

3897
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:29,039
the same crop that they produce mass

3898
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:29,679
massively on tissue culture levels where

3899
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:32,238
it's

3900
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:34,078
you know one you know specific thing and

3901
02:04:32,238 --> 02:04:35,919
i've heard botanists talk about you know

3902
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:36,479
trying to stabilize out cannabis into

3903
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,840
the way

3904
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:38,959
to where they can do that as well which

3905
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,480
i don't think they'll be able to do

3906
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,599
because cannabis lovers also love

3907
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:43,519
variety

3908
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,800
but uh it is one of the things that if

3909
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:46,560
they were to go to federal that they've

3910
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,880
talked about a lot of botanists are very

3911
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:51,280
big on the unit cropping idea

3912
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:53,279
of you know monetizing and just trying

3913
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:54,800
to make one crop that you can reproduce

3914
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:56,319
non-stop that's just you know

3915
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:58,079
commercially viable and it's going to be

3916
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:59,519
ahead of no way

3917
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:00,719
we'll get tired of that so quickly i go

3918
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,000
to the dispensary and i never buy the

3919
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:03,118
same thing two times in a row unless

3920
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,158
it's something i've read and they got it

3921
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:05,839
but every time i go i get different

3922
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:07,279
concentrates yeah but how many times do

3923
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,480
you ask for a different tomato at the

3924
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:10,719
grocery store dog

3925
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:11,519
how many times do you ask us that's

3926
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,960
that's a different

3927
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,880
different ballgame but i got roma's i

3928
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,840
got cherries i got uh those purple

3929
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,279
hearts but yeah

3930
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,480
i think uh there's always and if that

3931
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:20,399
does happen you're always going to be

3932
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:21,439
growing [ __ ] something you bred and

3933
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:23,759
i'm going to be growing something i

3934
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:24,960
bread and uh hopefully steve's growing

3935
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,280
something he bred and hopefully painted

3936
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:29,359
ladies growing something high bread

3937
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:31,039
yeah i've just i've heard rumors from

3938
02:05:29,359 --> 02:05:32,319
several botanists and several people on

3939
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,000
the multi-million dollar kind of

3940
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:34,479
commercial facilities who are trying to

3941
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,479
sew

3942
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:38,000
hardcore mono crops so they can just get

3943
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:39,439
these consistent [ __ ]

3944
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,118
that's just all the same and it's just

3945
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:42,960
kind of horrifying to think because we

3946
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:45,439
all love so much variety as cannabis

3947
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,439
consumers

3948
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,119
the gentleman that brought you quote

3949
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:51,039
unquote outrageous new strains was

3950
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:52,719
summarily fired two weeks ago

3951
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:54,800
do their credit just because they want

3952
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:56,480
to mono crop something doesn't mean

3953
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,960
it's going to suck and it doesn't mean

3954
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:03,839
they want monocrop

3955
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:03,840
enough varieties to fill a walmart um

3956
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:09,840
i'm not uh i'm not for that game i'm

3957
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:11,920
just playing devil's advocate

3958
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,000
uh if they've got they've got the

3959
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:17,199
resources to

3960
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:20,319
line breed one into

3961
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:22,319
homogeny they can do that again

3962
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:23,519
so if they can offer you one that they

3963
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:25,039
can grow by the acre

3964
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,360
watch out because in five years they'll

3965
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:29,118
offer you 10. well well that's what they

3966
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:30,559
do right now in idaho with the potato

3967
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:31,598
crops that literally my family has

3968
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,000
several potato farms

3969
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,840
up there and right now lays and [ __ ]

3970
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,359
pringles have their own potato that they

3971
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:38,800
tissue culture and every time they

3972
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:41,198
produce the same potato

3973
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,880
they only have the same potato they mono

3974
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:44,399
crop for those companies because they're

3975
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,480
specifically bred

3976
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:47,759
to be what that company wants it's a

3977
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:49,678
certain shape that works well in their

3978
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,039
machines it's a certain shape that cuts

3979
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,118
to the right point

3980
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:54,880
uh you know certain ones want elongated

3981
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:56,559
potatoes potatoes certain ones

3982
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,078
rounded potatoes depending on the

3983
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:58,880
company they'll monitor crop it out and

3984
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:01,039
tissue culture

3985
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,560
to the end of existence so we're going

3986
02:07:01,039 --> 02:07:03,920
to cut up tomatoes or potatoes i said

3987
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,480
tomatoes damn what's wrong with my brain

3988
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,158
injury

3989
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:08,319
i did that the other day talking about

3990
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:08,319
the

3991
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:15,439
he was potatoes up to say something just

3992
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:17,920
know there's no rapper

3993
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:19,279
talking about [ __ ] idahos and russets

3994
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,560
like nobody's got no rappers

3995
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:22,238
so as soon as a rapper starts rapping

3996
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,520
about potatoes then it'll change but

3997
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:25,039
everybody wants different weed like

3998
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,119
everybody's gonna always want different

3999
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:28,639
we i'm a breeder and i know that

4000
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:30,719
the mono crop ideal work a little bit in

4001
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,279
a big old commercial those guys this

4002
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:33,840
facility

4003
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:34,800
mono crop at the [ __ ] out but uh nobody

4004
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,078
buys one pack of the

4005
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,840
one pack of seeds from it they always

4006
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:39,279
get two packs and they always get like

4007
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,039
multiple different kinds so

4008
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:42,719
i don't see too many of the the home

4009
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:43,359
growers and the basement buccaneers

4010
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:45,279
doing that

4011
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,279
like no not necessarily without the

4012
02:07:45,279 --> 02:07:49,279
product

4013
02:07:47,279 --> 02:07:51,198
not the not the home growers but when

4014
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:53,519
you got somebody that wants to launch

4015
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:54,879
now you got to open your mind a little

4016
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:56,239
bit look into the future a little bit

4017
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,639
but when you've got somebody that wants

4018
02:07:56,238 --> 02:07:58,559
to

4019
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:59,920
launch an international product and they

4020
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,719
need to reproducible

4021
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,760
cannabinoids they need a stabilized line

4022
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:05,920
that can grow the same

4023
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,000
year to year to year to keep their

4024
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:10,409
product as consistent as you expect your

4025
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,000
cognac to be um

4026
02:08:10,409 --> 02:08:14,158
[Music]

4027
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,158
it's a it's a different ball game you'll

4028
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:17,759
always have the people that are making

4029
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:19,519
the

4030
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,639
you'll always have the the exotic mics

4031
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:24,560
of the world but you're gonna have

4032
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:26,719
come on come on some of us have to grow

4033
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,960
mids okay some of us have

4034
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:28,960
guys

4035
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,118
and if we grow it we're going to go

4036
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:37,840
allah

4037
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:37,839
all right

4038
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:44,078
right now people only know two red

4039
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:46,158
cigarettes

4040
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:47,359
are green cigarettes it's only two type

4041
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:50,000
they have mental or

4042
02:08:47,359 --> 02:08:51,359
some red type so once you have it a lot

4043
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,238
in demand it will be offered in the

4044
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:54,639
future

4045
02:08:52,238 --> 02:08:56,718
greatest thing about the ganjapay it

4046
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:59,359
will always get bigger and bigger

4047
02:08:56,719 --> 02:08:59,920
and bigger so the craft market will grow

4048
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:02,238
and

4049
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:04,158
you know our commute market will you

4050
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:05,919

4051
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:07,679
will have a nice piece of the pipe to

4052

i want a lot of different weed because i

4103
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:41,920
feel like i get

4104
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,000
i don't know i feel like after a certain

4105
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,520
amount of time i they just don't it just

4106
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,960
doesn't do it for me anymore and then i

4107
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,159
have switched up and they go back to and

4108
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:49,679
we have to be grateful

4109
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:51,279
we have to be grateful that we are at

4110
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:55,199
this point we can be picky

4111
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:55,198
usually it was high grade

4112
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,000
you can get a red stripe or a green

4113
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:11,279
stripe or a gold stripe one

4114
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,639
you always know what you're getting when

4115
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:14,639
you run out in between all right

4116
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:20,238
there's a couple things i've had in my

4117
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:22,800
lifetime

4118
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:23,759
just a couple where i could smoke 100

4119
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,599
pounds of that

4120
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:27,760
and not complain and not ask for

4121
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:29,760
anything different

4122
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,719
maybe two or three but that's it what is

4123
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,840
it you're gonna have to tell me at least

4124
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,880
yeah yeah we all want to know one of

4125
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:35,760
them at least

4126
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:39,840
i think that's like that there's there's

4127
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,840
nothing did you like

4128

all day

4170
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,360
and it just puts me in a really good

4171
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,000
head space where i get a ton of stuff

4172
02:13:11,359 --> 02:13:13,839
done

4173
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,880
and focus really well and just makes me

4174
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:19,039
happy nice how about you sequence you've

4175
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:20,960

uh i got this crescendo behind my head i

4177
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:28,239

4178
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:29,760
gmo probably some chicken with that gmo

4179
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:31,198

4181
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:33,359
batter

4182
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,719
really nice gmo is a really potent

4183
02:13:33,359 --> 02:13:35,920
strain so it's one like if you were

4184
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,198
going to put a lot of it in front of

4185
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,560
yourself that's one that you would pick

4186
02:13:37,198 --> 02:13:39,678
because it almost always tests it like

4187
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,239
30 plus percent

4188
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:43,440
and you know if you're gonna have a

4189
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:44,000
shitload of a strain and you're gonna

4190
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:45,279
get a tolerance

4191
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,118
to it you might as well get one that'll

4192
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:49,679
get you there yeah

4193
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:50,639
if you guys ever come across the uh star

4194
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,239
dog cory

4195
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:55,279
cut uh thank me later you won't be

4196
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:57,759
disappointed

4197
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:59,599
that is that the one that smells kind of

4198
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:00,320
like strawberries and watermelons and

4199
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:02,960
kind of

4200
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:04,799
real good for a commercial girl i don't

4201
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:06,719
i didn't get that from me

4202
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,159
okay i think that's allegedly the cut

4203
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:13,840
that i made star struck with

4204
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:13,839
allegedly but i have no proof of that

4205
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:30,239
look at his face three it's three uh

4206
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:31,118
this one is first i mean the cut the cut

4207
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:33,439
is about

4208
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:34,399
maybe a year and a half but this is

4209
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:36,319
maybe

4210
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:38,960
like three months right in my perfect

4211
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:41,198
smoking zone right yeah

4212
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,880
all right i hate to admit it but i will

4213
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:44,799
admit it i just keep getting

4214
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:46,239
why you know after i always have a zip

4215
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:48,800
for a quarter

4216
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:50,559
just yeah right now or a half quarter

4217
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,639
what does it smell like the bomb what is

4218
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:55,760
what does bubba smell like

4219
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:58,159
all right this one is sweet

4220
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:59,599
but it's not that artificial sweet it's

4221
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:03,198
like

4222
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:07,039
sugary but very mild sugar

4223
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:08,000
not like i would say like mapley but not

4224
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:09,359
super sweet

4225
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,039
if you understand it's not the sweet

4226
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:12,158
part of maple it's more like that

4227
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:14,880
honeysuckle

4228
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:15,679
i don't know it's kind of earthy and you

4229
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,760

02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:13,600
that was a glorious train wreck i'm not

4525
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,359
sure what i expected when i invited 100

4526
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:17,359
people to join me on a zoo meeting

4527
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:18,800
i'm not sure that if i expected 25 of

4528
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:19,520
them to show up but i am grateful that

4529
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:20,879
they did

4530
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,159
