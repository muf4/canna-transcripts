00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
beautifully um engraved embossed laser

102
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
etched i don't know exactly how but it

103
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
is beautifully done on the top of this

104
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,878
grinder

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,479
they even got the little gradient part

106
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,359
in the middle of the logo it's perfect

107
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,799
it's beautiful

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
thank you you did a hell of a good job

109
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
on the artwork then let's talk about the

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,280
grinder the grinder itself is

111
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,599
very well made very well constructed i'm

112
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,280
gonna say this is probably aluminum

113
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
i said that word very oddly but who

114
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
doesn't say aluminum oddly

115
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,000
uh it's got a nice grinding wheel on the

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
inside nice teeth in there they look

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,158
sharp they look strong then you unscrew

118
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,598
it

119
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,679
so you put your product in here right

120
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,679
give it a good twist chop chop chop chop

121
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
then you'd unscrew here then i kind of

122
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,439
like this part once you unscrew it

123
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
you kind of set that part to the side

124
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,639
there's a little dish in here

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
that is removable i like that this

126
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,438
little dish comes out

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,959
it's got a little screen on the bottom

128
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,318
of there of course you'd catch your uh

129
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,680
your keef catch down here in the bottom

130
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,719
it's got a little a little scraper for

131
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,719
your keef catch

132
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,080
i really enjoy that beautiful basic

133
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,840
grinder but it's got the logo

134
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
on it it's well made i like that little

135
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,000
cup in the middle beautiful

136

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
respectable and respectful letter uh

169
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,959
let's not

170
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,478
run around in too many circles let's get

171
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,478
right to it

172
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,758
it says uh you are the best and you give

173
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,680
back in so many ways

174
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,439
thanks and respect big respect the

175
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,959
respect is mutual here i can tell

176
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,959
uh by the way this is written that you

177
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,918
do disagree with me very respectfully

178
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,959
and that's a great way to have a

179
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,519
conversation

180
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,719
it goes on to say i do disagree with you

181
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,680
on one topic in episode 655 about

182
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
phenotypes

183
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
where you said that you're backing off

184
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,559
on your phenotype discussions and your

185
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,399
strained descriptions

186
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,918
i disagree that you should do that and

187
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,758
here is why

188
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,519
yes i did say that i feel like i'm

189
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,240
messing up by giving you

190
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,839
uh too much guidance and too much help

191
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
on selecting phenotypes

192
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,719
i feel like that is some work that you

193
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
should do that is custom work that

194
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
should be tailored for you that's why

195
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,199
there are phenotypes that's why they're

196
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,120
a selection to be done

197
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,720
that's part of the the beauty of growing

198
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,360
so i was gonna leave that up to you a

199
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
little bit

200
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
i feel like i've offered a quality

201
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,680
product why not give you some variation

202
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
to choose from

203
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
find what you want i've said all of this

204
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
on the previous episode

205
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
so let me keep going with this message

206
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,079
it says

207
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,439
i had a skunk number one sweet skunk

208
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,199
plant that i wanted to

209
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,639
improve upon which is a great use for

210
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
some of my genetics if you want to breed

211
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
something and make it a little better

212
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,360
some of my stuff is definitely a good

213
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,478
way to do that

214
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,879
it says i researched regular mail seeds

215
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,000
and i decided on a rise that is a very

216
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,719
good breeding plant

217
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
says my goals were to bring up my thc

218
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
and increase bud density while retaining

219
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,600
my skunk's bud formation

220
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,680
excuse me the skunk's bud formation

221
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,160
classic red orange light green and so

222
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
many

223
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,840
swelled bracts and she looks over seeded

224
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
traits so a trait of this plant is red

225
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,279
orange

226
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,478
and light green with swelled bracts that

227
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,918
look like they are over

228
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,758
seeded so it looks like it's got some

229
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,519
swollen bracks on there it's just a

230
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,639
trait of the plant it's not seeded but

231
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,719
it looks like it

232
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
that is a trait that is an observable

233
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
characteristic of

234
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,720
this plant so he wanted to keep that

235
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
trait along with the bud formation

236
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
then they wanted to add some density and

237
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,038
a little bit of potency so they

238
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
uh selected chose a rise as the breeding

239
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,399
male which is a very good choice

240
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,919
and they knew that because of the things

241
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,359
that i typed on my website we'll talk

242
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,240
about that

243
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
it goes on to say i got 10 arise seeds

244
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
from seeds herenow.com

245
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,240
i acquired four males i was hoping for a

246
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
50 50 fino but

247
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
no what i had to choose from was one

248
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,279
golden goat

249
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,638
one stretcher one daybreaker and one

250
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
question mark

251
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
i know this how you ask because of your

252
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,038
great

253
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
arise pheno descriptions so if i hadn't

254
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,399
described that a rise plant and those

255
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,879
phenos to expect

256
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,560
very well so well this listener this

257
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,439
breeder this grower would not have known

258
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
that a rise

259
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,879
would be the perfect candidate for

260
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
breeding to make his project what he

261
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
wanted it to be

262
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
so the reliable description that i

263
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
gained that gave the in-depth the

264
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
detailed description that i gave about

265
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
phenotypes

266
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,439
that really helped our grower friend our

267
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,318
breeder friend our listener maybe a

268
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,199
viewer friend

269
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
to make the proper selections so maybe

270
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,120
just maybe i do need to keep giving

271
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
those detailed descriptions there's more

272
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,439
to this it goes on it says

273
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,878
monkey puke that's a really great name

274
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
not something i would have used

275
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
something i do love so that's beautiful

276
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
i love it when you nail it and get the

277
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
name right

278
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,240
and you didn't take something i would

279
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,439
have used nothing wrong with it i love

280
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
the name it's just not

281
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,598
uh not on my brand i got to stay on

282
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,038
brand it's off-brand for me it's very on

283
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,000
brand for you probably so that's

284
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,680
beautiful monkey

285
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,519
puke uh if i saw a jar of monkey puke on

286
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
the shelf i would want to smell that

287
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,799
what does monkey puke smell like that's

288
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,759
what my brain i just go what does and i

289
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,598
would know it's not

290
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,200
real monkey puke there was not a primate

291
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,599
involved there was no vomiting to be

292
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
done

293
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,278
but i think that's what monkey puke is

294
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
gonna smell like once i smell the jar

295
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,519
that's what you've done to my brain i

296
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
really think i'm smelling monkey puke

297
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
weird psychological tricks we play on

298
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
people with strain names here let me

299
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
continue here monkey puke

300
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,278
f1 which is skunk one to arise is in day

301
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,320
45 and i think i got

302
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,759
exactly what i wanted i love so many

303
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,760
things about this message

304
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,278
uh the respectful argument uh the

305
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,000
respectful disagreement may be my

306
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,080
favorite part

307
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,919
then the you've mentioned so many

308
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,720
details about your breeding your goal

309
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,799
your idea the reason you were doing this

310
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
that is so awesome and it looks like you

311
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,319
are hitting your goal your 45 days in

312
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,159
and it appears like you were getting

313
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,519
what you wanted and expected out of that

314
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,360
that's exciting

315
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
from one breeder to another that is

316
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
really exciting good job big up much

317
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
respect

318
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,919
that is super cool i'm excited for you

319
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
brother really just from one bro one

320
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,240
breeder to another i know what it's like

321
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,159
when it's like

322
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
45 days in and you're going oh i think

323
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,278
i've done it i might have got exactly

324
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
what i wanted it's like when the chef

325
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,519
starts smelling the ingredients and

326
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
everybody

327
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,399
uh in the kitchen it smells good right

328
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
but people in the living room start

329
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,958
peeking their head and going

330
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
bro what are you doing in here it smells

331
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,719
[ __ ] good that's where we are

332
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
if you're not a grower if you're not a

333
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
breeder you don't understand the feeling

334
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,359
that is the feeling when somebody

335
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,120
peeps their head in the kitchen and goes

336
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,200
dude whatever you're cooking

337
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,799
i can't wait for it to be done that's

338
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
where we are with this project and it's

339
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,958
exciting i'm excited for you bro if you

340
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
can't tell

341
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,239
um it says only time and possibly an

342
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
f2 generation will tell i love that

343
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,278
you're even ready

344
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,879
already already ready to take it to f2

345
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,720
we haven't even finished the f1 batch

346
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,240
this guy's excited and eager

347
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
these are the types of breeders we need

348
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,919
in this industry um

349
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
the point remains that i would have no

350
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,039
idea what i was looking for in a mail

351
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,958
without your arise

352
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,039
strain description and you're selecting

353
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,078
a mail podcast

354
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,399
with 99 of the other breeders work you

355
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,599
have

356
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,639
zero zip nothing to go by you're a one

357
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
percenter my friend

358
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,319
don't change what you're doing add more

359
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,240
strain descriptions

360
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,079
i'm gonna interrupt myself here and i'm

361
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
going to say my website needs some

362
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,679
attention you guys i've got strain

363
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,078
descriptions and photos for most of my

364
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,919
stuff

365
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,519
up there if you look at the website you

366
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,879
notice there's not a photo there's not a

367
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,399
strain description for something that

368
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,000
you've got experience with

369
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,679
send me a message include that photo

370
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,278
include that strained description

371
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,479
if you've just got some details about a

372
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,519
strain that you think should be on the

373
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
website

374
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,120
this one gets super fat at the end of

375
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
week nine if you let this one go to week

376
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
10 it gets super stinky

377
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
whatever you notice send me some details

378
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
like that i will send you a thanks i

379
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,879
will give you a shout out

380
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,399
i will make it worth it to you if you've

those photos

383
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
maybe i just need to update the website

384
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,759
with your photos maybe your photos are

385
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,039
better than what's there

386
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,720
don't be shy i would like to get the

387
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,519
website updated for the start of the

388
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
year

389
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,639
um thank you all right let's get right

390
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
back into this

391
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,759
uh so keep adding the strain

392
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
descriptions don't change keep what

393
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
you're doing add more descriptions

394
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,639
that's where we were in this

395
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
uh yes i want to add more descriptions i

396
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,240
want to add more pictures

397
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,078
i want to talk more about phenotypes uh

398
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
it is summertime i just realized i've

399
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,239
got an

400
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,639
awesome summer project i wasn't prepared

401
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
for um i will do more stuff on the

402
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,919
website i just asked for help for that

403
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,359
and as i grow these strains i do learn

404
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,240
more things about them i have to grow

405
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
them i have to

406
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
develop the relationship if i don't see

407
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,839
that something uh is factual i don't put

408
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,799
it on the website i don't just ramble

409
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
off some [ __ ]

410
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,719
uh like say that it's bright green and

411
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,000
smells like a skunk's ass and it makes

412
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800
you feel like you just came when you

413
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
smoke it like

414
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,679
i could put that on the website about

415
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
everything but there's no need to do

416
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,919
that you're going to buy it you're going

417
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
to grow it you're going to smoke it then

418
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,240
you're going to call me back and say i

419
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,039
still don't feel like i came after you

420
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,159
smoke it

421
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,480
and no one's going to want to buy that

422
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,000
again so um i have to grow them i have

423
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
to get the experience i have to develop

424
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
their relationship to be able to talk

425
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
about it

426
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,839
uh in that sort of a deep detail so be

427
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
patient with me there are

428
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,760
so many limitations i was running a lot

429
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,120
of not running working with and

430
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,958
operating in a lot of commercial

431
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
facilities since covid

432
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
i've really dialed that back so i'm on

433
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
my own personal

434
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
space and numbers which really really

435
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,078
limits a breeder so i've got

436
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,919
a lot of test growers out there helping

437
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,439
me out and stuff we're learning a lot

438
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,078
but not as rapidly as we could when we

439
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
had the commercial

440
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,078
environments at our fingertips all right

441
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,639
where was i by the way

442
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,439
i got the most beautiful and lemony

443
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,680
plant ever

444
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
in the tent with monkey puke she's an

445
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,958
awesome lemon sunrise

446
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,799
what what so there's a beautiful and

447
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,119
lemony plant ever in the tent

448
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,479
she's an awesome lemon sunrise that's a

449
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
huge compliment my friend

450
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
you are breeding with my genetics you

451
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
are growing my genetics

452
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,078
i'm honored that you trust me you trust

453
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,399
my breeding you trust my selections

454
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,199
and then thank you for the respectful

455
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,759
argument

456
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,079
you have convinced me i will continue to

457
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,679
do in-depth phenotype explanations what

458
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,319
i want to do

459
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,319
is help you guys identify the phenos and

460
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
know what to expect what i don't want

461
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,360
you to do

462
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
is uh make you search too hard for the

463
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,000
phenotypes that i have talked about

464
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
i don't want you passing up awesome

465
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,679
phenotypes that would work very well for

466
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,000
you because you heard me talk about a

467
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,919
different

468
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
phenotype find the one that is going to

469
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,319
work beautifully for you and work with

470
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,078
that one that's

471
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
i don't want to mess you up is really

472
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,679
what i'm trying to avoid

473
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
i will help you identify phenos if

474
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,479
you're like hey does this look more like

475
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,519
the mean girl does this look more like

476
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,079
the stretchy girl

477
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,720
i will tell you that stuff also keep in

478
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,519
mind

479
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,600
these phenotypes i'm giving you ideas

480
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
and suggestions of kind of guidelines of

481
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,759
what box it may fall

482
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,679
into it could be more of the mean girl

483
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,360
phenotype and the nice girl and the

484
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,120
chunky girl phenotype it could have i

485
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
could see all of that in there

486
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,240
and it just doesn't have to be labeled

487
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,278
one of those phenos i'm just saying

488
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,039
those are the common

489
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,879
phenotypes that i have identified and

490
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,719
traits that i have observed

491
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,439
over time from working with these plants

492
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
so many times

493
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,519
so i will continue to give in-depth

494
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,879
descriptions of new stuff i will update

495
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,278
the old stuff

496
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,958
i will continue to give you phenotype

497
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,000
ideas of what to expect out of the

498
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,000
phenotypes

499
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
i will continue to help you identify

500
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
phenotypes if you send me a picture and

501
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
you say

502
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,759
uh does this look more goat-leaning or

503
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,720
more arise-leaning i will try to help

504
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,319
you with that

505
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
don't get offended if i don't respond

506
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,240
right away i've got um

507
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,919
i'm going to say about 18 000 unread

508
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
emails right now it's nothing personal

509
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,519
there's just one of me

510
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
and there must be at least 18 000 of you

511
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,159
with the question

512
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,838
and i cannot keep up i don't have an

513
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,480
intern i don't have a secretary it is

514
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,399
all me

515
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,959
i do the grow for the first half of the

516
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
day i do the podcast or internet work

517
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,000
for the second half of the day

518
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,919
then the third half of the day is when i

519
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,919
do all the normal life stuff that most

520
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,599
people do

521
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,679
and yeah there are three halves to my

522
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,040
day so my days are different than yours

523
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,679
i'm trying to catch up

524
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,078
um i guess being a small business owner

525
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,039
or a business owner a proprietor

526
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,719
an entrepreneur i guess being overloaded

527
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,480
is a good thing if i catch up that means

528
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,959
i [ __ ] up to tell you the truth so

529
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
uh i apologize that i'm behind also i'm

530
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,879
very grateful that i'm behind it's kind

531
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,799
of a double-edged sword also

532
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,720
i used to let it super stress me that my

533
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,559
social media inboxes were overflowed my

534
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
email inboxes were overflowed

535
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,799
at this point i have accepted it it is

536
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,879
just something that is going to be

537
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,479
i want to reply to you i want to answer

538
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,639
your messages but

539
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,159
i want to do a lot of [ __ ] also i also

540
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
want to take a nap so

541
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,360
uh don't take it personally if i'm not

542
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
answering your message

543
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
send me send me your questions uh send

544
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
me the phenotype questions is what i'm

545
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,759
getting at

546
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,920
let me know which phenotype you need me

547
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,919
to identify i'll do my best but

548
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,360
don't expect it to fall exactly in one

549
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,039
of the boxes it doesn't have to be

550
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
golden goat it doesn't have to be a rise

551
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,319
it doesn't have to be the 50 50. maybe

552
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,680
it's the 30 70.

553
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,600
maybe i'm gonna say it looks kind of

554
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,198
golden goat but also has the bud shape

555
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
and the leaf structure of the platinum

556
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:11,679
tangy

557
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,958
you might get different [ __ ] like that

558
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,758
and that is possible

559
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,119
with genetics that's how it works so

560
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,879
thank you for the great feedback this

561
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,919
one came from our friend who calls

562
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,000
themselves

563
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,159
s c dung slinger 79

564
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,078
um i'm guessing that's some organics

565
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,639
with the dung slinger and 79 is probably

566
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,799
the year you're born and sc is probably

567
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,879
south carolina i'm just guessing i am

568
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,639
assuming making an ass of myself but big

569
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:41,439
shout out to our buddy scdungslinger79

570
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
pollen chucked genetics i do appreciate

571
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
the

572
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,879

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
love to hear it

578
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,799
the email address is grow from your

579
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,720
heart at hotmail.com

580
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,799
don't be shy send me some messages all

581
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
right the next message that i've got

582
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,838
unfolded here on the table that i'm

583
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
trying to pull out from underneath the

584
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,679
computer

585
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,558
comes from our friend pete and it is a

586
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
quick one

587
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,639
and it says should i hang a

588
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,600
battery-powered lantern

589
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
in the flower and veg tent if my power

590
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,519
will be turn

591
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,918
power will be turned off for eight hours

592
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,798
the electrical company is replacing an

593
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,240
electric

594
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:29,119
pole um no i think

595
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
that eight hours of off time will be

596
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,279
just fine

597
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,519
you can interrupt the daylight cycle and

598
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,678
give them this eight hours of off time

599
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:42,400
and they will be okay what you cannot do

600
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,640
is interrupt the dark cycle and expect

601
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,919
them to be okay

602
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,679
excuse me i'm trying not to burp into

603
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,520
the microphone here

604
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,798
all right i think i'm better what i

605
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,759
wanted to say was

606
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,960
you can interrupt the daytime cycle if

607
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,798
the plants get extra

608
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
dark it is okay they're gonna think it

609
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,000
was a shady day

610
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,519
i was cloudy or something like that they

611
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,558
just weren't getting as much sun as they

612
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,319
should have they're gonna be like oh

613
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,000
it's nice and cloudy it's dreary

614
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,200
uh they're gonna have netflix and chill

615
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,798
that day they're just gonna chill out

616
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,798
take a break you're not gonna get

617
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,400
the photosynthesis and metabolism you're

618
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,798
not gonna get the growth that day that

619
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,840
you normally would have but it's

620
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,440
18 hours uh 24 hours of light that

621
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,639
you're not gonna get not that big of a

622
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
deal it's actually just you're

623
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
interrupting eight hours

624
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,559
so you can interrupt the daytime with

625
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
unexpected darkness i wouldn't do that

626
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,038
all the time

627
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,558
but this one time this one day when

628
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,839
they're doing construction this will not

629
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,279
be a problem

630
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,439
now the other part of this that i want

631
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,839
to make sure to say is you cannot

632
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
interrupt the dark cycle when those

633
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,038
plants are in a flowering phase and

634
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
you've got them in the dark for 18 or

635
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,240
for 12 hours

636
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,079
do not interrupt that 12 hours of

637
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,359
darkness that is more critical that will

638
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,759
cause you problems

639
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,839
that could lead to issues down the road

640
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,440
so i do not think you need to hang a

641
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,359
battery powered lantern

642
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,558
in the flower or veg tents if they're

643
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,319
only going to be off

644
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,079
for this one day for eight hours that

645
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,759
shouldn't be too big of a deal

646
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,199
you may notice that the tents get a

647
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,599
little bit humid you may need to figure

648
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
out

649
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,279
open some doors open some windows get

650
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
that humid smell out or humid out of

651
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,759
there but then

652
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,199
you're gonna get that stanky ass smell

653
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,400
it's going to stink because your carbon

654
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
filters are not running you're going to

655
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
have some things to think about right

656
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,399
now

657
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
it's only going to be eight hours the

658
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,160
main thing is don't panic and do

659
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
anything stupid to make it worse you may

660
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,519
just want to leave while the power is

661
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,200
out just go somewhere else and say

662
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,038
the plant's got to deal with it i've got

663
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,038
to deal with it the plants will be fine

664
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,200

681
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,519
you think it should be

682

just go do a little bit of a check cover

683
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,918
your own ass

684
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,240
if you've got an air conditioner that's

685
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
on a timer or has some settings check

686
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
those settings go make sure all your

687
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,200
fans and blowers

688
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,479
are reset the way that they should be

689
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
then walk around the house

690
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,319
fix the clock on the microwave the clock

691
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
on anything that went off most of our

692
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,720
stuff's digital and resets itself now

693
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
but

694
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,240
go fix all the clocks go make sure that

695
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,038
they're all synced up get that [ __ ]

696
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,319
corrected

697
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,480
all right so i don't think you need to

698
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,399
hang up a battery powered lantern

699
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,919
um the plants will be fine they're just

700
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
going to think it was a shady day

701
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,880
again you guys you can have darkness

702
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,798
during the light cycle that shouldn't

703
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,200
cause you too big of a problem if it is

704
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:38,798
not

705
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,200
major for too long if you're doing it

706
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,240
for more than 24 hours or so it may

707
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
start to

708
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,279
tell your plants it's a good idea to go

709
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,840
into flower but

710
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,720
8 to 12 to 14 20 hours shouldn't be a

711
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,678
big deal

712
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
what you cannot do is have light during

713
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,880
the dark cycle

714
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
do not think about it just like this

715
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
during the day can you take a nap

716
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,759
it would be totally fine right take a

717
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,799
nap be cool make it nice and dark just

718
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,879
lay down get some sneak

719
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,798
some snoozes i was gonna say some snores

720
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,159
and some snoozes at the same time

721
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,839
gonna leave that [ __ ] in there that's

722
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,760
the kind of day it has been

723
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,519
uh make it dark for a few minutes get

724
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,038
nice and stoned and pass out for like an

725
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,079
hour and wake up and feel refreshed you

726
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,679
can do that right

727
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,119
what if i wake you up for an hour in the

728
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,400
middle of the night and expect you to do

729
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,000
[ __ ] you're going to be mad at me

730
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
the plants feel the same way they could

731
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,839
take a nap they don't want to get woken

732
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
up unexpectedly so that's how the plants

733
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,839
operate

734
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,038
