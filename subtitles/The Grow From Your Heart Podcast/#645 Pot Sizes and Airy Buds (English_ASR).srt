lot of the products i went for

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
um they didn't have the the first choice

78
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,878
products i went for i've always got a

79
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,639
backup plan they did not have the

80
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,239
soilless mix i prefer to buy they did

81
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
not have the base nutrients i wanted to

82
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
buy they didn't have a pesticide i was

83
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
looking for

84
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,039
they were out of rapid rooters it was

85
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,159
slim pickens at the grow store today it

86
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,598
was like all the b and c

87
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,919
rate products were on the shelf and all

88
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,878
the a-rate [ __ ] has been bought it has

89
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,639
been taken

90
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,239
uh they were waiting for trucks they did

91
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,359
not know when [ __ ] was coming i went to

92
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,200
another store

93
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
same story over there i really think all

94
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,318
the [ __ ] was on the same truck going to

95
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,159
all of the gross stores

96
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,958
they're waiting the [ __ ] is just not

97
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,239
coming so um you guys have a backup plan

98
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,840
is what i'm getting at if you were out

99
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
there shopping for grow supplies if you

100
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
were stubborn about what you use in the

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
grow

102
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
this is not gonna be the season for you

103
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
whether you're growing indoors or

104
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,759
outdoors you're going to need to be

105
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
flexible

106
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,120
because this covets situation the

107
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,039
pandemic the quarantine

108
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
all the weird shutdowns and [ __ ] have

109
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,919
made supplies

110
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,919
scarce they're more expensive they're

111
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,280
harder to get and it's going to take you

112
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,039
a little longer to get the things you're

113
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
sourcing if you can even find

114
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,878
your favorite products you may need to

115
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,158
find a backup plan uh get a

116
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,239
the second product that thing you've

117
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,878
been wondering if it works now may be

118
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
the time

119
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,399
for you to find out if that [ __ ] works

120
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
which could work out sometimes that's

121
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,039
how you find out that that other product

122
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,798
is better or

123
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,079
did something you didn't know it did

124
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
maybe you'll find some cool

125
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
[ __ ] but have a backup plan you guys if

126
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,919
you've got an outdoor grow coming up

127
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,439

128
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,679

129
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,519

130
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,719

some supplies while i was at the groce

137
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
store

138
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,079
i was asked a question i did take a

139
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
little bit of a note here on my phone

140
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
i'm not texting anybody i'm not hanging

141
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
out

142
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
on any chat i'm actually reading a

143
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
message on the phone i did take some

144
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,679
notes

145
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
at the grow store i got asked can you

146
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
explain why

147
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,719
transplanting a plant is a good idea

148
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
this person wanted to they were

149
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,879
wondering

150
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
uh the word that i want to use is

151
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,519
graduating the pots they wanted to just

152
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,198
go from

153
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
a paper towel when they germinate their

154
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,240
seed into their big seven gallon finish

155
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
or pot

156
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
and they were asking me why i recommend

157
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
up potting from

158
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,479
a small container to a medium-sized

159
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
maybe bigger then into that seven

160
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,680
uh i would do it a couple of different

161
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,439
ways depending on the time space

162
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,478
environment the requirements for the

163
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,399
room there are a lot of different

164
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,360
challenges and things we would face here

165
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,279
but they were asking uh how and why uh

166
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
we would go about doing different pot

167
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,839
sizes

168
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,758
why do we do that why wouldn't i just

169
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,079
put my seedling this little tiny

170
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
seedling into a seven gallon pot

171
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,599
filled with soilless mix or cocoa or

172
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,120
whatever we've chosen to use why can't i

173
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
just go into the straight pot

174
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,720
you can but think about all of the water

175
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,319
it's going to take to water that big pot

176
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
you don't need to use that much water

177
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,079
you could put that seedling and time

178
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,519
inside of a little teeny tiny pot and

179
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,680
you only have to water that little

180
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,000
section which gives you less opportunity

181
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,639
for

182
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
over watering you're gonna have less

183
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,478
space

184
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
to disrupt you're not gonna have to pour

185
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,038
a gallon of water in there you can just

186
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,799
pour a little bit of water in there and

187
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,159
that seedling will get the water that it

188
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
needs also

189
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
that's that much less cocoa that you

190
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,399
have to use right now if you don't need

191
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
that much cocoa

192
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,519
you don't have to buy that much cocoa so

193
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,439
you don't have to

194
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,560
put a little seedling in a big pot then

195
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,839
you're not going to risk over

196
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,839
watering it that's one of the main

197
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,879
issues over watering in that big pot

198
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,799
will be easy

199
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,639
because how much water what how much of

200
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
that big pot do i need to water you're

201
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,360
going to try to just water that little

202
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,319
space right there but then the roots are

203
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
going to grow and you're always going to

204
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,199
be chasing it

205
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
i start off honestly you've seen me do

206
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,879
my clones in a beer cup

207
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
i start off in a beer cup or a four or

208
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,600
six inch net pot is what i will start a

209
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,038
seedling in

210
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,439
i'll let it grow in there until it

211
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,038
becomes nearly root bound i want it

212
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,639
just pressing up against the walls there

213
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,478
i want the roots to say hey it is time

214
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
for some new shoes before they get new

215
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,719
shoes

216
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,360
so another reason i like that is a

217
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
faster wet and dry time i don't like my

218
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
plants staying wet for too long i like

219
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,079
them

220
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,000
uh not like dry but i don't want them

221
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
soggy the whole time i want there to be

222
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,439
availability for oxygen in that root

223
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,720
space when they dry out a little bit

224
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,759
there's room for air when there's too

225
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
much water in there

226
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
the water takes all the space where the

227
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,758
oxygen would be and the plants don't get

228
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
as much air i think

229
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
oxygen to the root space really

230
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,879
encourages root growth happy plants they

231
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
eat more they feed better

232
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,560
they perform better so a smaller pot

233
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,758
gives me a little bit

234
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
of a faster wet and dry cycle and in a

235
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
smaller pot that's good because i just

236
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
want those

237
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
roots to grow i want the plants to grow

238
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
so i can get them into their bigger pots

239
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,038
sooner so we've got these little plants

240
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,079
put them in a little cup put them in a

241
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,038
little pot

242
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,318
um water them less often also if you're

243
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,000
watering less space

244
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,598
you're wasting less nutrients you don't

245
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,519
have to mix up as much food

246
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,519
you're not going to water a 7 gallon pot

247
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,038
worth of space and only get the middle

248
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,038
you could have mixed up a little bit and

249
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,279
just watered that one small cup

250
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,478
so i think starting off small i would

251
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,839
start with a cup

252
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,399
excuse me i'd start with a cup and then

253
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,079
work my way into maybe a one gallon or a

254
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,399
three gallon and then that three gallon

255
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,680
would either go into a five or a seven

256
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,799
so i do a cup or a one or a cup into a

257
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,199
one and then that one

258
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,038
or the cup into the three gallon or into

259
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
the five gallon or the three gallon into

260
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,598
a seven i kind of just work my way up

261
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,959
i don't like to go uh too big too fast i

262
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,560
like him to grow in there and get a

263
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,198
little bit root bound i was saying i

264
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
want them

265
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,319
kind of pushing the edge i want them

266
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
like if they were a size 13

267
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
shoe i want them in a 12 and a half like

268
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,680
i want to be like hey bro can i get my

269
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
13s and then we'll upgrade them right

270
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
when they're ready

271
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,199
and then when i take them out of the pot

272
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,758
i kind of uh from the bottom i put my

273
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
fingers

274
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
into the bottom of the root zone and

275
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,319
just spread it out a little bit

276
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,918
so that it looks like you just blew the

277
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,439
bottom of that plant right up and people

278
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,639
like well you just [ __ ] up your roots

279
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,120
yes i did

280
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
and when i pot it into the next pot that

281
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
[ __ ] up root section is going to be

282
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,479
the most explosive root section in that

283
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
whole pot that part's going to go oh he

284
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,038
gave us a little opening

285
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,478
because right now the roots are kind of

286
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,038
tight they're wrapped around inside that

287
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,399
cup

288
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,439
i reached in there and pulled them apart

289
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,038
a little bit and gave them a little

290
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,759
space and that space is where the roots

291
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,519
are going to go

292
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,879
let's grow and they're going to take off

293
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,079
they're going to explode so i let them

294
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
get a little bit

295
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,839
tight in their early pot they want new

296
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,120
shoes they're begging for new kicks

297
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,638
before i put them in there

298
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,079
as soon as they get their new kicks they

299
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,519
take off running remember when you gave

300
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,279
a new little kid new shoes

301
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,478
or when you gave a little kid new shoes

302
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,239
he thought he could run faster the

303
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,240
plants are going to do the same

304
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
damn thing so you have less chance for

305
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
over watering

306
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
um they dry down more quickly you get to

307
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,478
water them more frequently if you get a

308
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,399
quicker dry and wet time more feeding

309
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,639
more watering time i like that

310
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
commercial grower i like that i let them

311
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,000
get tight that way when you up pot them

312
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,278
they do go a little bit more quickly

313
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
they take off

314
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,519
then here's another great thing in my

315
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
grow space

316
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
uh in a commercial environment or in

317
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,959
most places where uh we aren't super

318
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,480
limited by numbers

319
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,479
uh space is valuable and if i've got

320
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,600
a little tiny plant that is six inches

321
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
tall in

322
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
a seven gallon pot which i'm going to

323
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,679
guess is about 18 inches in diameter

324
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,639
i am wasting a lot of space

325
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,319
i can put those plants into smaller pots

326
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,480
and i can push them together

327
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
much closer which does a couple of

328
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,680
things i bought a lot more space which

329
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,559
means i've got room for a lot more

330
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,559
plants

331
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,239
uh keep in mind those are gonna get up

332
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,518
potted into bigger pots later and you'll

333
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,879
have to put them into the flower room

334
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
and they will take up more space but if

335
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,919
you're dividing rooms and they're going

336
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,039
multiple places you need more room for

337
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,039
more pots

338
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,879
smaller pots while you can is not a bad

339
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,519
idea

340
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,320
then if you're taking up less floor

341
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
space

342
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
with plants that means we can probably

343
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
turn off a couple of lights

344
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,920
if those plants are able to be moved

345
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
over to one side of the room and they

346
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,079
all fit

347
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,519
underneath two or three lights instead

348
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
of running all six or eight lights in

349
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
that room

350
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,759
you can save yourself that much

351
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
electricity the lights are on for

352
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,039
at least 18 hours a day in this

353
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
environment because we got small veg

354
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,759
plants we want them on eighteen six or

355
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
more

356
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,039
running one or two lights at that rate

357
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,078
is going to cost a little bit of money i

358
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,879
don't care if you're a commercial

359
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,958
environment

360
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,039
a home grow that will add up quite

361
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,639
quickly because along with that light

362
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,480
every light that's running you've got

363
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,000
a little bit of air conditioning going

364
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
you probably got a fan going

365
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
there's a dehumidifier every light adds

366
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
more equipment don't just think that

367
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,078
you're paying for that light when the

368
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
light runs

369
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,599
because there's a fan going with that

370
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,039
light there's something that goes along

371
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
with it to keep it cool

372
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,078
keep it comfortable the light creates

373
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
heat we got to move the heat then we

374
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,879
move the heat we create humidity you got

375
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,399
to get rid of the humidity

376
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,480
so many things happen because of that

377
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,120
light so don't just consider the cost of

378
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,039
the light

379
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
it's you're saving a lot of other things

380
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,120
when you turn off that light

381
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,799
so uh move those those big seven gallon

382
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
pots they're like 18 inches around i

383
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,759
think i'm i'm guessing i'm a drummer i

384
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
guess they're about 18 inches i'm

385
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,240
looking at 18 inch floor tom next to me

386
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,240
uh probably about 16 18 inches around

387
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,919
a three gallon pot i think is about 12

388
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,278
inches around when you look at that in a

389
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,559
grow room you can fit

390
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,200
uh three to four three gallon pots in

391
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,439
the space

392
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
of two seven gallon pots if you do it

393
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,399
right so save you a lot of room move

394
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,720
them closer together if you're doing one

395
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,639
gallon pots and get a bunch in there

396
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,560
don't cram the plants in so tight that

397
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,679
they're pushing on each other give them

398
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,359
space but i'm saying

399
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,799
don't waste a bunch of space in your

400
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,600
grow environment that's why

401
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,639
i would start with smaller pots uh start

402
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
off in a cup

403
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,480
or a one gallon pot or a net pot and

404
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,519
then as soon as it starts to get tight

405
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
in there and that plant's getting a

406
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
little bit bigger

407
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
that's when i put it into my next pot

408
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
now it has gone officially

409
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,000
in my labeling system from small veg to

410
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
its

411
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,679
vegetative stage now it's actually in

412
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
veg it's vegging it's not small veg it's

413
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,719
veg and then the next stage is like

414
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,079
we're about to flower these [ __ ]

415
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
that's when they get lollipopped and

416
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,399
cleaned up and start getting really

417
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,120
worked but

418
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,320
um yeah transplant them that way you can

419
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,278
save yourself space

420
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,959
save nutrients save water save soil you

421
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,720
can save lighting by pushing the plants

422
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,239
closer together by saving lighting

423
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,759
you're saving electricity by saving

424
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,799
electricity you were saving

425
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,958
a lot of money um i think i covered that

426
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,799
one that was a pretty good ramble on for

427
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,119
what was meant to be just a really quick

428
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,159
topic there so yeah graduated pot size i

429
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,919
do encourage you

430
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,919
to work your way up from a smaller pot

431
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,838
to a bigger pot to your final

432
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,039
destination pot which you do choose to

433
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,320
flower in

434
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,240
you don't want the plants to get root

435
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
bound if they do get root bound some

436
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,799
plants may panic on you they may start

437
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,639
to flower they'll stop

438
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,159
feeding they'll look really pissed off

439
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
it'll be confusing like why are these

440
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,240
plants doing this weird [ __ ] they're

441
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,320
root bound

442
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,039
they want to go into a bigger pot when

443
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,560
you up pot every time i up pot

444
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,199
i like to sprinkle a little bit of

445
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,039
microbe product either around the roots

446
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
of the plant that i'm potting or into

447
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,919
the hole in which it is getting potted

448
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
so i pull that pot that plant out of the

449
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,958
pot

450
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,480
the container i can see my white roots

451
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,559
on the outside of that dirt

452
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
just holding all that dirt together i'll

453
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,719
get a root product or a

454
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,838
mico product and just dust the outside

455
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,519
of it just sprinkle it

456
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
i'll turn that pot with my hand just

457
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
spin it and i'll just use a little cup

458
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
and just sprinkle some of the microbes

459
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,559
on there

460
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,719
and then i pot it on there there are

461
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,719
already microbes on that root zone

462
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
telling those roots hey bro go crazy

463
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
life is gonna be good in here

464
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
as soon as you put some water on it all

465
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,759
that [ __ ] activates it goes crazy

466
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,039
those plants go shabang kapow

467
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,720
all right i think i talked long enough

468
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,399
about that part let me read an email

469
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
that i've got here in front of me or

470
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,278
this podcast is going to get out of

471
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,359
control

472
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,399
long um big shout out to all my friends

474
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,480
hanging out at the grow store i

475
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
apologize for

476
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,480
if i seemed rude because i was in a

477
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
hurry today i was simply

478
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,120
in a [ __ ] hurry today i was trying to

479
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,559
get a lot done and they didn't have what

480
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
i needed so that meant i had to go to

481
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,919
more

482
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
stores i was trying to be rude i had

483
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,039
[ __ ] to do

484
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,360
all right this one is not the one i'm

485
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,120
looking for is this the message i need

486
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
here we go this is the message i need

487
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,039
right here

488
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,278
excuse me for clearing the throat this

489
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,000
one says hey ross to jeff before my

490
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,838
question

491
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
i just wanted to shout you out and thank

492
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,560
you for all you do for the grow

493
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
community

494
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,078
i love the show because other podcasts

495
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
don't stay informational

496
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,359
and they can be hard to consume and

497
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
they're time consuming

498
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,440
and it's hard learning this process i

499

about what i do but i try to talk about

521
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
just growing and not

522
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,399

uh let me get to the point here it says

527
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
my question and thank you for the

528
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,399
compliments dude it says my question

529
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,799
i'm running a 9x7 tent with two 1000

530
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,839
watt

531
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,359
mar mars hydro ts lights uh carbon

532
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,880
filter we got some details in here i'm

533
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,399
growing at three five and seven gallon

534
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,120
pots normally only running

535
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,039
three to five pots at a time i only use

536
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,919
fox farm ocean forest

537
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,159
and i always grow 100 organically i'm

538
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,479
using down to earth dry fertilizers

539
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,439
and bat guano i also add fish [ __ ] every

540
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
feed as well

541
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,600
so we got the down to earth dry ferts uh

542
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,879
bone meal

543
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,879
uh bat guano and fish [ __ ] every feed

544
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,639
uh each of my first five grows has

545
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,240
taught me new things and how to solve

546
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,240
different problems

547
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
the grow might have that is that's a

548
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,039
great thing to notice that every grow

549
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
you've solved a problem and gotten a

550
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,719
little bit better

551
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,159
none of your grows are going to be

552
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
problem free every grove is going to

553
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,799
have some sort of obstacle or hurdle an

554
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,000
issue to deal with

555
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,159
it's learning to deal with those

556
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,759
obstacles and eliminate them and not go

557
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,799
into panic mode i've seen growers i've

558
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,720
done it myself

559
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,639
you see an issue and you go oh [ __ ]

560
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,079
there's a problem all the alarms go off

561
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,680
in your head you [ __ ] pull the rip

562
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,719
cord you got to do all this dumb [ __ ] to

563
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,799
solve the problem

564
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,959
when really all you needed to do was go

565
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,399
take a dab or go smoke a [ __ ] joint

566
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,838
and really think clearly about how to

567
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
fix it needle went oh you know that's a

568
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,360
dumb problem i can solve this overnight

569
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,720
you don't get panic mode so quickly

570
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
because you realize that these plants

571
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
are fixable problems are solvable

572
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
so as long as you're learning something

573
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
with every grow you're making great

574
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
progress

575
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,560
let me find my spot here there we are my

576
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,559
spot on this message says

577
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,439
but i seem to be lacking in the nutrient

578
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,758
knowledge and the dry and cure stage

579
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
because before harvest the plants smell

580
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,680
amazing

581
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,680
and have a nice dense consistency but

582
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,039
after dry and cured the buds are airy

583
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,439
and light and have no

584
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,599
density there are a few things that can

585
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
be causing that i wrote that down

586
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
could be a lot of stuff adding up to

587
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,679
cause that

588
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,879
it goes on to say i have yet to have my

589
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,719
product smell or taste even close to

590
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,078
what it's like before i chop them down i

591
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
have a couple ideas why that's happening

592
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,078
as well

593
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,120
i've listened to your dry and cure

594
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,120
episode and other reliable sources but i

595
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
uh seem to not be able to translate that

596
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,278
knowledge i soak up into physically and

597
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,599
visually understanding this process

598
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,439
i have a hygrometer in the dry and cure

599
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,438
area but unfortunately i'm not

600
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,519
able to keep that area 100 dark that

601
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,439
dark isn't 100 crucial

602
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,599
but i do keep the humidity under 50

603
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,519
percent let's try to get that to about

604
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,678
50 or 60 percent

605
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,918
and make your product take just a little

606
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
bit longer to dry may help you out

607
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
uh what could be the main reason for my

608
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,198
airy buds and loss of aroma

609
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
thanks again ross to jeff for all the

610
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
information and time you have given

611
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,959
you give every day to home growers

612
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,798
learning

613
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,759
one love from and then i'm not sure if

614
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,119
they want their name said we're just

615
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,319
going to call him kyle today big shout

616
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,279
out to kyle thank you for the great

617
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,759
message bro

618
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,879
i do have some answers here i think i

619
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,879
can help you out a little bit

620
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,279
let me start with the disclaimer because

621
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,240
i like to do this uh organic growing

622
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,879
is not my specialty i straight up am a

623
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,798
bottled

624
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
nutrient grower i grow with new

625
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,720
millennium bottled nutrients sometimes i

626
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
add some products from veg bloom

627
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,640
or hydroponic research is the company

628
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,919
but most of what i'm growing

629
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,240
is non-organic i'm a salt-based grower

630
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,000
i find it easier in a commercial

631
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,919
environment to train a crew

632
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,079
to write a standard operating procedure

633
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
to have repeatable results results

634
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,678
by using bottled nutrients i love the

635
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,480
organics i love the idea i love the

636
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,280
passion

637
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,640
i love the sustainability but the way i

638
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,279
know how to grow

639
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,720
the goal for my commercial facilities

640
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,918
that i'm hired to help with

641
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
the goal that the owners have i think

642
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
that a

643
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,400
bottled nutrient system is the way to go

644
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
for my style it's repeatable it's

645
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,519
sustainable

646
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,720
i know how to do it the organics i don't

647
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,798
understand how to make it

648
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
repeatable and sustainable i don't

649
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,480
understand how to make it

650
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
trainable for a crew i need to write

651
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
down instructions that can be done

652
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,319
by anybody when i'm gone

653
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,240
i think organics uh there are a lot of

654
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,000
variables that we would have to

655
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,599
have some hands-on experience and some

656
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
eyes to think about a little bit too

657
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,038
much

658
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,960
with the bottled nutrients i say 20 of

659
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,960
this 50 of this 20 of that and every

660
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
time we feed it it is the same

661
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,319
thing with organics you can get some

662
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,038
variables in there ah this is

663
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,639
my thought process on the whole thing so

664
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,279
i'm not an organic grower

665
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,840
that part is not my area of expertise so

666
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,038
when it comes to your nutrient knowledge

667
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,798
lacking i as well am lacking nutrients

668
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,558
knowledge in this department because i

669
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,160
don't do the organic stuff i understand

670
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,399
the nutrients i understand the elements

671
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,679
i understand the way the plants feed

672
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
but i'm doing it a little bit

673
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
differently than you are so i may not

674
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,558
have all of the answers when it comes to

675
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,200
the nutrient part

676
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,079
but um also i'm not sure if that is

677
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
enough

678
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,480
light in this room i'm not sure of the

679
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,000
spread of that light it could be enough

680
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,759
light but what i'm learning about leds

681
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,919
is they don't spread a lot we need more

682
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,359
spread on these leds i'm not complaining

683
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
i'm just saying that's what i'm learning

684
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,759
so

685
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,360
i'm wondering if you've got like one

686
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,879
section with a lot of light and the rest

687
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,000
of the room isn't getting a lot of light

688
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
because that'll help

689
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,599
uh more light spread around more proper

690
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,439
light would help with intensity

691
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,719
would help with bud density is what i'm

692
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
getting at so

693
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,519
one thing i would recommend to start

694
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,480
with and i don't know that this is doing

695
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,158
it i am uh

696
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
i'm guessing and assuming based on the

697
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,120
information i've got i'm trying to give

698
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,440
useful information

699
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,119
are you trellising are you using a net

700
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,720
to hold down the main tops if you've got

701
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,479
one top that's sticking up

702
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,319
that light is hitting this one we've

703
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,839
talked about this before that bud's

704
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,119
getting really hot but the rest of the

705
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,558
plants down here aren't getting the

706
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,558
intense light that they could

707
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,319
trellis this one down then the light

708
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,079
will hit all of the buds and all of the

709
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,879
buds will have a chance to be more dense

710
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,439
you won't have

711
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
tops that are real nice real tight kind

712
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
of good and then bottoms that are

713
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,079
shittier you'll have

714
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,279
a bunch of decent buds at the top maybe

715
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,519
they'll tighten up for you if you do

716
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,960
that that's just one idea

717
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,119
um i was looking at your nutrients a

718
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
little bit maybe a kelp

719
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,038
product in there would help you out i

720
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,879
don't know when you're feeding what

721
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,519
but i know that kelp products do help

722
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,840
with stank and density in my opinion in

723
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,839
my

724
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,599
experience a kelp product would help you

725
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,240
out there are plenty

726
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,240
of organic kelp products which you can

727
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
mix into your soil to begin with

728
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,079
or you can find a liquid kelp product

729
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
which you can feed in later

730
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,279
or you can find a kelp product that you

731
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,038
can foliar feed

732
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,558
uh you're trying to go organic so you're

733
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,158
going to have to do your research on

734
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,918
those products but that is a good start

735
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,600
for those ideas uh airy buds

736
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,520
is that that's probably grow

737
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,959
and cure related but we're gonna say it

738
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,480
starts in the grow there are a lot of

739
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
things that can be giving you

740
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,960
airy buds have you tried multiple

741
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,760
genetics the genetics have a lot to do

742
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
with that

743
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,440
if you're growing something that's from

744
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,199
a tropical environment that's meant to

745
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,038
be real airy because it gets humid there

746
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
and they need some airflow in those buds

747
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,038
that bud naturally just is not going to

748
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,679
be real dense if you're growing some og

749
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,839
kush

750
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
some chem dog and it's not getting dense

751
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,000
that is a room

752
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,840
or a feed issue there's a problem there

753
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,519
so let's check the genetics that's

754
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,678
something i would check on then

755
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,240
light is there enough light in that room

756
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,280
honestly i'm not familiar with the mars

757
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,200
hydro light

758
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,639
i don't know if that's enough uh

759
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,880
lighting i don't know if that's enough

760
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
wattage and i don't know the spread on

761
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,799
that light in that size of a room

762
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,480
i honestly don't know but that's

763
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,440
something we can check on something we

764
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,120
could investigate

765
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
that's one of the things on the list i

766
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,519
would eliminate to see if that is the

767
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
problem

768
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,879
is there enough light and like i

769
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
mentioned you have that one bud right in

770
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,679
the light is that bud good are you

771
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,558
trellising it down to get the light

772
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,320
everywhere

773
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,678
are you defoliating to get that light

774
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,439
further down into the canopy and get

775
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,880
some light penetration that may help you

776
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,759
out as well

777
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
something that does make uh fluffy buds

778
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,679
that will make the buds

779
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,439
actually fluff out and become airy and

780
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,840
be not as dense as they could

781
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
is environmental factors like too much

782
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,199
heat

783
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,159
think about in the summer um when it

784
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
gets too hot

785
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,840
you don't want even in the summer you

786
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,640
don't want your own hands resting on

787
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,000
your legs

788
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,759
your hands get all sweaty where your

789
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,038
hands are resting on your legs the

790
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,200
plants are just like that

791
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,720
they're gonna go hey calyx stacking on

792
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
top of me i don't want you up there and

793
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,038
they're just gonna start spreading and

794
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,640
getting fluffy

795
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,240
uh when it gets too hot they're just

796
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
trying to spread their legs so they're

797
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,200
not getting hot between their legs

798
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,558
the plants are doing the same thing like

799
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,519
bro it's too hot i'm trying to spread

800
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:08,798
out a little bit

801
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,400
those plants are doing the same thing

802
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,240
it's too hot it's too humid it's too

803
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
sticky the plants feel funky

804
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,919
instead of being dense they're getting

805
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,439
fluffy also they know if they get too

806
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,880
dense all that moisture will build up

807
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
inside of those buds

808
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
and if it's too humid in there all that

809
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
moisture will create a problem you'll

810
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
get boitritis or powdery mildew inside

811
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,200
of your buds

812
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,440
so um heat moisture things like that

813
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,919
could be causing you problems also a

814
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,880
drastic diurnal swing if you're getting

815
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,400
uh too hot at night or too cold in the

816
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,400
day or opposite or

817
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,679
more than eight to 12 degrees change

818
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,798
from day to night temperature

819
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
that can play a role in your fluffy buds

820
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,918
another thing the feeding if you're not

821
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,200
feeding properly if they're not getting

822
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
the food that they need

823
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
and they're not getting the nutrients

824
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
just imagine if you didn't eat proper

825
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,400
food you wouldn't build up the way you

826
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,640
needed to either

827
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,840
i'm a skinny dude i eat a pretty good

828
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
vegetarian diet

829
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,439
i look like a stick figure brock lesnar

830
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,278
is my height

831
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,679
but about three times my width in

832
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,240
density he eats a totally different diet

833
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,640
than me

834
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,519
he eats a high performance [ __ ] high

835
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
protein

836
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,440
rip your head off [ __ ] down your throat

837
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
kind of diet your plants may be needing

838
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,440
that brock lesnar diet

839
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,239
you may be giving them the rasta jeff

840
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,080
pasta and carbohydrate diet so

841
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
maybe it's diet i read what you're

842
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,439
giving them but i don't know exactly

843
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,599
how much of that and i don't know

844
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
exactly what's in all of those products

845
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,038
so you may need to add a couple of

846
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,200
things to boost that up a kelp product

847
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,038
maybe a bloom booster i don't know

848
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,640
exactly i made the disclaimer dude i

849
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,359
don't know exactly what you're doing

850
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,960
with these

851
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,599
organic nutrients i don't know what i'm

852
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,159
doing with your organic nutrients

853
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,759
so it could be a feed issue um i wrote

854
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
down trellis make sure you get more a

855
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,079
more consistent canopy

856
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
i've talked about that that even canopy

857
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,960
will help you out that way the light

858
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,840
will get to all of the buds

859
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,600
you won't have some dense some fluffy we

860
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,319
call the fluffy buds larf that stuff on

861
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,319
the bottom

862
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,519
that's larfey crap i usually pinch that

863
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,480
off it doesn't even make it to the

864
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,798
flower area

865
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,319
nobody wants to trim that that's junk uh

866
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,000
pinch that [ __ ] off if the light's not

867
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,639
getting down there get that off

868
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,359
let's try to move some of the energy to

869
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
the actual

870
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,639
bud part of the plants this should make

871
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,840
the buds tighter

872
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,600
more dense um so

873
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,959
that is what i think could be happening

874
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,359
during the grow

875
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,798
that is making the aroma and the density

876
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,158
lack in these plants

877
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,000
the second part is probably in the

878
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,440
dry and cure process something is

879
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
happening during the harvest time

880
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
light degrades terpenes heat degrades

881
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,038
terpenes

882
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,400
are these plants getting too warm are

883
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,919
you able to give them

884
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,640
a period of dark and cool for

885
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
12 to 24 hours before you harvest them

886
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,200
that may

887
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,038
that'll give you so the overnight while

888
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
the plants are sleeping in the dark and

889
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,000
the cool they will produce they

890
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,278
produce that word came out really weird

891
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,759
i hope i get some comments on that they

892
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,000
will

893
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,759
produce a bunch of terpenes right

894
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,798
they'll produce terps all night long

895
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,200
while they're sleeping

896
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,798
in that cool dark environment when you

897
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
start turning on lights and heat

898
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,240
those terps start getting uh they start

899
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,159
volatizing they start getting uh

900
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,519
degrading they start getting destroyed

901
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,278
so if you can get it cool and dark in

902
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,079
there for a while build up as many terps

903
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,558
as possible

904
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,839
give yourself a head start keep it cool

905
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,720
the whole time you're drying and

906
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,199
trimming it

907
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,880
try not to handle it too much uh try not

908
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,519
to touch it too much during the trim

909
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,799
process and the defoliation process

910
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,960
um you might be drying too quickly maybe

911
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,720
let's slow down the drying process a

912
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,480
little bit just a little tiny bit

913
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
you said you're keeping it about 50

914
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,319
humidity let's go about 60 and slow that

915
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,840
drying cure time

916
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,359
down just a little bit i know that

917
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,319
sounds crazy you want to smoke your

918
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,038
product but

919
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,038
you want to smoke a better product is

920
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,640
that dry and cure room cold enough if

921
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,558
it's colder the buds will get

922
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
tighter as they dry up if it's not cold

923
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,000
enough they're not gonna do that

924
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,440
um is it too dry in there is it too hot

925
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
in the dry and cure room that's gonna

926
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
[ __ ] up your product

927
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
is there wind in there the wind could be

928
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
blowing

929
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,480
your buds just drying drying them right

930
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
off it's just blowing the terps right

931
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,319
out

932
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,600
think about when you ride a motorcycle

933
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,879
or if you go out on the boat or if you

934
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,119
hang out in the wind all day

935
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
your lips are all chapped [ __ ] your

936
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,000
skin feels all dry

937
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,440
these plants if they're in the wind

938
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,440
hanging and drying in the wind or if

939
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,960
there's too much airflow in the dry room

940
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,880
they're doing the same thing all your

941
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,319
terps all your moisture it just got

942
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,600
sucked right out of the room

943
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,439
it's all in the room that's why your

944
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,759
herb smells like hay so i really think

945
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,519
that slowing down the drying and curing

946
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,119
process could help you out just go a

947
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,798
little bit slower

948
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:44,398
and if you're not getting um like a

949
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,440
an ammonia um an acrid pissy kind of

950
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,839
aroma

951
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,440
you're not trapping too much moisture in

952
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,359
there and you're not sealing it up too

953
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,200
early so i don't think that you're not

954
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,959
ruining it you're not giving you're not

955
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
getting the opportunity to ruin it i

956
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
think it may just be drying

957
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640
too quickly for you uh so i would check

958
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
all the things we talked about in the

959
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,278
grow

960
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,599
is there proper lighting are you taking

961
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,798
care of the genetics the trellising the

962
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,359
heat the feed

963
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,480
humidity is the lights air water soil

964
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,639
the laws that's

965
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,079
laws l-a-w-s you guys have you thought

966
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,679
about that if i taught you that

967
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,038
i think i learned it from subcool i want

968
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
to give somebody credit because i think

969
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,519
it's uh

970
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,879
it's polite and important for a teacher

971
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,158
to give credit where you learn [ __ ] i

972
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
didn't learn everything i didn't make it

973
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,000
all up i think i learned

974
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,440
laws lights air water and soil i think i

975
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,759
learned that from subcool

976
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
are you following all of the laws if all

977
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,480
the laws are in line

978
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
then let's check out the dry and cure

979
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,960
tech we may need to just slow it down a

980
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
little bit

981
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
increase the humidity lower the

982
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,399
temperature may help you out just get it

983
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,079
slowed down just a little bit my last

984
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,479
note on this subject

985
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,480
is where are you drying and curing this

986
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,278
product are you doing it in the basement

987
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,798
are you doing it

988
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,519
under the grow lights where is this

989
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,398
happening if you dry and cure your

990
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,720
product

991
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,519
in a funky scented basement your product

992
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
will get

993
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,158
funky basement terps to it if you're

994
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,759
drying it in the bathroom it's going to

995
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,159
pick up bathroom terps

996
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,359
so that may be something that's going on

997
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,520
so for tighter more

998
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,678
dense more aroma i'm really thinking

999
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,599
it's going to be a slower drying cure

1000
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
at a lower temperature that's going to

1001
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,959
help you out

1002
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,798
um maybe send me some pictures of the

1003
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,399
plants right before you cut them

1004
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,679

1005
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,839
