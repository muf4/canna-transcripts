00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,130
logos and stuff the logo goes first I've

98

did all of my handmade stuff the shirt

99
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,150

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,829

00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,848
stuff and don't feel guilty you just

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,620
wrapped a killer outdoor Grove session

167
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:48,060
again yeah that's true big shot it to

168
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,699
Jesse for coming and helping us do some

169
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,589
outdoor grow lessons so I'm sure that

170
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,210
series every year I feel like I got a

171
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:55,769
pack so much info into every single

172
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,418
episode those are when I don't give a

173
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,500
full informative episode I feel like I'm

174
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:00,269
kind of cheating myself and the

175
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,370
listeners right there are episodes where

176
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,448
I've had to stop and pause repeatedly

177
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,360
while I take notes

178
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,340
they're so hyper detail that's fantastic

179
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,770
I've got and I know I keep saying I've

180
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,879
got those podcasts in the works the ones

181
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,870
we're gonna have I've got the folder

182
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,399
right here my hand you can hear this

183
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,829
this is all this page gets more

184
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,359
impressive every week yeah I'm gonna do

185
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,589
those I'm just I'm trying to perfect

186
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
them those are episodes that are gonna

187
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,649
be in-depth and I'm kind of a

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,689
perfectionist so when they come out like

189
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,089
that they're really good but on this

190
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,050
episode we're gonna talk about like I

191
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,060
pulled that background I've been

192
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,460
podcasting a while in this podcast we're

193
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,288
gonna talk about a letter that the DEA

194
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,668
sent who the hell did they send it to do

195
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:38,908
they just publish it or was it actually

196
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,389
mailed to people this was the big dust

197
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:43,889
of this

198
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:46,829
the the letter clatter that everyone

199
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:51,710
freaked out about over CBD did your face

200
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,709
just break this story almost broke me

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,280
the big dust-up is basically saying the

202
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:01,049
DEA just made CBD illegally game and

203
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,309
that's silly because it was never legal

204
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,919
right we're gonna get to that let me

205
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,449
read this and then we're definitely

206
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,698
gonna talk about why it's silly and

207
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,319
we'll talk about a lot of details there

208
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,810
are a lot of different versions of this

209
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,210
article the main part that I want to

210
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,449
focus on is a quote the store is a great

211
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:20,339
example of just how fake news can be

212
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,468
right look there are different degrees

213
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,908
of [ __ ] they can work their way into

214
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:25,379
a press story I've read it in three or

215
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,418
four different locations and the part I

216
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,550
want to focus on is mainly quoted from

217
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,378
the DEA themselves so that can't be

218
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,028
wrong and then the the buffers around it

219
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,550
we can talk [ __ ] about a blot on every

220
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:36,990
website so this one I chose the one the

221
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,310
Leafly article looked like a crock of

222
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,650
[ __ ] to me I didn't like the Leafly

223
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,839
article so I chose to go with the

224
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,149
article from the Green Rush daily I

225
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,579
shout out to the Green Rush daily the

226
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,709
headline is the DEA just banned CBD and

227
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,538
here's why and then there's a giant ad

228
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,008
and then I finally scroll like seven

229
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,439
Scrolls and I get to the article it says

230
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,199
the legality of CBD is no longer in the

231
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,870
gray area in fact the DEA just banned

232
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,650
CBD cementing its place in the list of

233
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:08,459
schedule 1 substances CBD or cannabidiol

234
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:10,528
is a compound or cannabinoid in cannabis

235
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,209
that won't get you high what it does do

236
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:15,718
though is stop seizures and aid in

237
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,829
suffering from dilib delipcious I'm the

238
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,829
one that wanted to talk [ __ ] about an

239
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,878
article and I can't speak English words

240
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,918
debilitating is the word I was trying to

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,629
say I nailed cannabinoid and can a video

242
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,028
but I can't say debilitating you guys

243
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,800
see the question how full especially on

244
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:31,019
a phone yeah especially after all those

245
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,948
dabs that the dabs never help with

246
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:37,319
reading aloud that's true um I I may be

247
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,668
the exception to that rule I'm an

248
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,050
introvert and then sometimes when I

249
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:44,819
smoke a lot oh yeah yeah okay so we'll

250
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,740
keep going this is so why is the DEA

251
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,028
putting it on why is the DEA putting it

252
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,959
on the list of the most harmful drugs

253
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,429
available to man

254
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,929
probably the same reasons they

255
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,229
temporarily banned the herbal pain

256
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,269
reliever trade on earlier

257
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,920
here they're both alternatives to more

258
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,000
dangerous prescription opiates that are

259
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,309
plaguing the country

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,620
the DEA action seemed to protect Big

261
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:04,629
Pharma's pockets more than the health of

262
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,919
American citizens that's not the point

263
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,340
that I wanted to get to there talking

264
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,719
about it was they were doing so well and

265
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,629
then they went off into [ __ ] lands

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,129
yes yes well just just that quick it was

267
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,899
somewhere I wanted to venture into later

268
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:19,120
in the episode I didn't jump right into

269
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,590
it into the target Ville because I think

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,789
that maybe have something to do with it

271
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,530
they see that if there are

272
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,629
pharmaceutical companies working with it

273
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,220
they don't want us having that market

274
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,120
they want a corner that before we do so

275
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,920
there you're just gonna shut us down

276
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,320
like oh no you can't even play so now we

277
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,319
win they just landed on free parking by

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,580
[ __ ] us but I want to keep going the

279
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,740
archaic spelling of the word marijuana

280
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,600
with an H is used in the text in federal

281
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,669
and the Federal Register announcing the

282
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,610
rule probably to avoid turning up in

283
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:47,919
marijuana related search results oh wow

284
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,779
is that true they think that no it's

285
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:56,259
just how the [ __ ] feds spell it you

286
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:57,069
[ __ ] conspiracy refresh daily I was

287
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,470
like ah [ __ ]

288
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,879
and then you said at the top and I went

289
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,100
I should have liked me cuz yeah and I

290
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,169
knew this was going okay I think this

291
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,190
will be helpful for our listeners yep

292
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:12,039
because I'll spawn women age

293
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:16,510
yeah it's that's just how the feds spell

294
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:19,949
marijuana the and this is where what a

295
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:23,439
lot of the fake news is oriented around

296
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,800
basically everybody has heard of CBD by

297
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,250
now coast to coast the is CBDs a

298
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,859
household term now people have seen

299
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,539
through sanjay gupta's specials and

300
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,610
through YouTube videos and Facebook

301
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:40,149
posts how helpful it can be with

302
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:44,550
Parkinson's with seizure disorders with

303
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:50,110
deface syndrome with pain management

304
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:52,000
with the change in federal policy with

305
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,480
the Ogden memo and the Cole memo that

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,409
led to marijuana markets like we have

307
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,090
here in Colorado where they're legal

308
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:03,699
some of those like Colorado's included

309
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,170
legal hemp and so last year the year

310
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,930
before the Fed

311
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:11,259
just like the : Ogden memos did for high

312
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:13,959
THC cannabis they put out a little blurb

313
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,139
in the farm bill covering industrial

314
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,200
hemp and putting a definition for what

315
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:23,289
industrial hemp is and so under the

316
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,410
guise of that legal loophole a number of

317
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:28,750
companies both domestic and foreign

318
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:32,169
started selling TVs or CBD extract

319
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,970
online in all 50 states making it

320
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:36,129
available pretty much everywhere

321
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,360
companies like CBD life water have

322
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:41,710
sprung up that are trying to get

323
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,690
distribution in all 50 states and it's

324
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,389
under a gray market loophole created by

325
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,280
the farm bill it is in no way legal the

326
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,899
feds have always considered every part

327
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,970
of the cannabis plant it doesn't matter

328
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,620
if it's sativa indica have ruderalis

329
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,149
they don't give a [ __ ] it let me jump in

330
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,649
right there because that's right or am

331
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,279
in this article and they spell it

332
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:03,029
marijuana with an H why because these

333
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,649
laws are based in [ __ ] racism and

334
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,929
that was a lot of where that the

335
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,759
original basis for these comes from so

336
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,379
when the feds write a new marijuana law

337
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,689
it's on the backs of all the old

338
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:18,669
marijuana laws and they keep the same

339
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,720
racist ass smelling alright look like I

340
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,819
know well let me finish the article

341
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,350
you're fired up and I like it but I have

342
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,010
to get through this article to make the

343
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,090
show show it says the reason given that

344
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,519
the US is complying with the

345
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,500
international drug control treaties wait

346
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,600
the reason giving is that the OKs is

347
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,120
that they are so the deploy a stated

348
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,310
reason for the the change this week is

349
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,529
to help them comply with international

350
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:44,019
narcotics trees then they say before

351
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,730
this elaboration CBDs legality was in a

352
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,799
gray area it was assumed that CBD

353
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,720
extracted from medical cannabis was only

354
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,629
legal for medical marijuana patients any

355
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,850
illegal to the rest however CBD derived

356
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,500
from industrial hemp was being sold

357
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,509
across the country as if it were

358
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,340
federally federally legal well

359
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,230
apparently the DEA has always believed

360
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,240
any form of cannabis extract to be

361
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,120
Schedule one okay

362
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,250
if I handed you a CBD molecule a

363
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,320
scientist to CBD molecule and I said did

364
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,879
this come from hemp or cannabis he'd

365
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,560
probably tell me to go [ __ ] myself cuz

366
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,500
it's the same thing he would say it's a

367
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,039
molecule so the DEA claims if there are

368
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,110
small

369
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,849
of cannabinoids in every CBD extract

370
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,399
they cite this as another reason to keep

371
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,440
CBD on schedule one for practical

372
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,198
purposes all extracts that contains CBD

373
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,509
will also contain at least small amounts

374
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:34,659
of other cannabinoids however if it were

375
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,850
possible to produce the form of cannabis

376
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,809
plant I'm sorry they wrote this weirder

377
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,000
there's an ad right here I'm skipping

378
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,439
through it let's see produce from the

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,600
cannabis plant extract they contain only

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,060
CBD and no other cannabinoids such an

381
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,490
extract would fall within the new drug

382
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,708
code so basically the DEA made

383
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,750
extracting CBD completely illegal

384
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,549
whether it's from hemp or not whether it

385
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,750
is pure CBD cuz they are wrong right

386
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:59,289
there when they say that you can't get

387
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,149
pure CBD because I know I'm thinking

388
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:02,679
counting I can put five fingers up and

389
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,690
confidently say that I know five people

390
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,729
that I could call friends that can make

391
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,310
CBD isolate that is ninety-nine point

392
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,379
eight or nine percent CBD that one or

393
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,299
two percent is atmospheric conditions

394
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,480
there are things like oxygen in there

395
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:19,299
that they cannot control yeah it's you

396
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,659
can get a hundred percent pure CBD lots

397
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:24,278
of different places the the DEA is

398
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,019
position on it doesn't have anything to

399
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,019
do with their being trace cannabinoids

400
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,850
in it that's just something they happen

401
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,799
to mumble during the press conference so

402
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,990
it's always been but have you always

403
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,528
been illegal just like every part of the

404
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,870
cannabis plant is illegal federally the

405
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:43,240
seeds are illegal though the leaves are

406
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,810
illegal the root ball is illegal the pot

407
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,049
you grew it it is illegal it doesn't

408
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:53,409
matter if it's industrial hemp every

409
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:54,519
year I'm just to be safe every eighteen

410
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,189
months

411
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,860
some Drug Task Force somewhere like East

412
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,939
[ __ ] Texas makes the announcement

413
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,550
that they've just found the world's

414
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:05,438
biggest pot farm and they're raiding it

415
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:08,559
today and they they didn't catch any

416
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:11,889
growers and it's headline news on Monday

417
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,328
in its headline news on Tuesday and then

418
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,360
there's nothing about it in the press on

419
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:17,948
Wednesday and next Friday comes out that

420
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,970
it was a wild Hempfield

421
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:24,250
on some farmers back it's 400 or 400

422
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,350
acres in the middle of nowhere and it

423
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,919
was the weather conditions that spring

424
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:33,159
were perfect for feral hemp to go nuts

425
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,809
and the DEA will spend $100,000 ripping

426
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,209
all of that feral hemp out of the ground

427
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,979
and burning it because it's the

428
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,420
dangerous marijuana plant it doesn't

429
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,279
matter that it's growing wild it doesn't

430
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,259
have any tea if you smoked any of that

431
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,699
stuff if you harvested dried and cured

432
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,860
it properly all that [ __ ] would do is

433
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,410
give you a headache there's an Indian

434
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,200
Reservation I want to say it was in New

435
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:56,980
Mexico somewhere hot and kind of

436
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,870
miserable to live where feral hemp was

437
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,450
just everywhere they couldn't do

438
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,029
anything about it it was an issue and

439
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,980
they'd found a way to basically build

440
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,360
whole houses with it with hemp creed and

441
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,539
a couple of other products and they were

442
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,120
doing it all on site and the feds would

443
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:15,399
show up every now and again and burn

444
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,190
their hemp down because it's dangerous

445
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,620
hemp I mean this happens all over the

446
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,780
country the DEA wastes small fortunes

447
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,580
ripping wild hemp plants out of the

448
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,470
ground that are left over from the 30s

449
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,900
and 40s when hemp was grown as a crop

450
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,670
all over the US when there's a terrible

451
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,610
heroin epidemic everywhere right now

452
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:35,649
like Colorado Springs is littered with

453
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,730
crystal meth meth is everywhere in

454
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,230
Springs people are driving around on

455
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,420
bicycles looking at [ __ ] trash cans

456
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,279
all over Colorado Springs Pueblo it

457
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:43,899
Pueblo is dead it's Friday night right

458
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,549
now you guys it's Friday night at 10:30

459
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,139
it's [ __ ] quiet all the people that

460
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,519
used to be out raging doing heroin not

461
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,230
all but I mean a good [ __ ] portion of

462
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,419
our young people are out doing heroin

463
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,370
right now and the DEA is worried about

464
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:58,479
[ __ ] with plants that keep us cool I

465
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,810
mean not even cannabis fun cannabis that

466
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,740
gets you stoned and it they're hemp

467
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:06,759
just stuff you make jeans with houses

468
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,940
bricks

469
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,890
textiles necklaces right there's an

470
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,410
infinite number of products you can make

471
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,300
with with hemp and that was part of the

472
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,970
the reason they they included the

473
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,448
exemption in the farm bill last year the

474
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,838
year before to to designate what exactly

475
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,600
is industrial hemp because everybody I

476
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:32,200
mean everybody everybody understands how

477
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:34,539
absurd our hemp laws are but as far as

478
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,130
law enforcement is concerned cops can't

479
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:38,349
tell the difference between hemp and

480
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,820
weed and they're pretty sure you can

481
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,719
grow the two next to each other so you

482
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:45,058
could heart hide your high THC plants

483
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,650
your hemp plants which anyone that's

484
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,599
ever growing either crop knows how

485
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,390
insane that is but law enforcement

486
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,399
across the country still argue [ __ ] like

487
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,860
that in federal court well to keep the

488
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,830
DEA noted since all surgeons like this

489
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:01,649
Ansel is growing a bunch of it's all CBD

490
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:03,089
plants and it looks like killer cannabis

491
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,159
plants if they told me that that was

492
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:06,449
White Widow or something I honestly

493
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,940
couldn't tell the difference on their

494
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,009
plants they have got can't very cannabis

495
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,960
looking some of them can be very very

496
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,029
similar it depends what the hemp you're

497
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,788
growing has been bred to do yeah yeah

498
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:21,298
and if I understand what son Saul is

499
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:23,609
doing is they're producing CBD extract

500
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,619
it looks like it grows just like phyllo

501
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:27,678
and that's that's the type of hemp you

502
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,058
would want for a high CBD extra

503
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,830
production but that I'm guessing that

504
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,980
amp strain would be crap if they tried

505
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:37,109
to make fuel oil and fiber it's not

506
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,909
fibrous um I mean that's one of the

507
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,649
great things about cannabis is it can be

508
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,169
bred one way or the other to achieve an

509
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,659
infinite number absolutely of final

510
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,580
products but as far as the feds are

511
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:51,120
concerned every single part of its

512
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:53,279
illegal the only legal hemp or marijuana

513
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,189
products that are federally legal in the

514
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,139
United States are hemp clothing produced

515
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,000
in other countries are produced from

516
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,460
fabric that was grown in other countries

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,169
and silly loans and hemp seed oil oh she

518
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,029
and I mean products that were produced

519
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:12,409
with plant material grown in other

520
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:17,149
countries everything else is at least

521
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:20,190
gray market the FDA and a couple other

522
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,110
national safety organizations release

523
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,630
the thing we even did a blurb about it

524
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:28,019
on the show about the foreign companies

525
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,240
selling god knows what is CBD extract is

526
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,129
usually erotic random [ __ ] in there yep

527
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,069
they were testing it and it didn't have

528
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,539
a lot of CBD in it or maybe it did but

529
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:41,939
it had a lot of crap in it you didn't

530
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:44,009
want us along with it is filler that's

531
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,870
what you get in a gray market you get a

532
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:49,140
lot of knockoff products you get a lot

533
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:50,908
of mislabeled products and this is why

534
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,620
I've been freaking out about getting

535
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,450
people politically active disease just

536
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,889
doing this for their own financial gain

537
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,370
do you think the pharmaceutical

538
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,490
companies are

539
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,319
planning something with CBD products um

540
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,519
there's a couple in Great Britain and

541
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,319
around the country that are already

542
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:09,750
working with THC CBD products GW

543
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,269
Pharmaceuticals is working a couple of

544
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,819
different product lines but there's

545
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:17,910
still five ten years from market okay

546
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:23,189
I'm sure the binnacle industry don't

547
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:25,200
that don't want THC and see like they

548
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,460
would prefer to I as an industry I'm

549
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,039
sure they would prefer to have control

550
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,470
of all medications that people carried

551
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,240
yeah but that's not physically possible

552
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,679
they don't want to make it better they

553
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,269
want to mask my symptoms and keep

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,940
feeding me a pill to make me a customer

555
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,440
and greed is like the one conspiracy

556
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,049
theory you're gonna get me to buy into

557
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,900
anywhere but with a decision like this

558
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:51,269
this is just business as usual this is

559
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,910
the exact same I mean this has been true

560
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,470
since nineteen forty and people are

561
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,290
freaking out about this decision today

562
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,789
because they issued it it's a own serial

563
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:04,109
number so they can track the caesars

564
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:06,149
separately and I mean I encourage the

565
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:09,119
move because tracking [ __ ] separately is

566
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,610
helpful right now any anti marijuana

567
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,589
group is going to tell you that ten

568
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:16,109
years ago fifteen years ago the average

569
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:18,539
THC content in marijuana was one to

570
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:22,229
three percent and they can back that up

571
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,670
with DEA seizure numbers and the reason

572
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,220
that's true is because they've been

573
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:33,960
seizing fields of [ __ ] barrel hemp

574
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:35,640
every year for decades and I mean it's

575
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,190
always been illegal this is nothing new

576
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,530
tracking it separately helps us figure

577
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,049
out okay exactly how much did they waste

578
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,700
ripping up half out of the ground how

579
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:46,409
much money did they waste making sure

580
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,140
Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last

581
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,058
year how much money did they waste

582
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,590
rounding up hemp seed off the inner or

583
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,299
hemp oil off the internet off the side

584
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:57,269
of the highways you drive to New Mexico

585
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,700
I mean it's nuts there how many people

586
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,500
since they've got these companies that

587
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,950
are shipping CBD

588
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,819
they're gonna have to like the people

589
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,990
there's a company I don't I don't know

590
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:08,189
if I want to say anybody's names I don't

591
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,390
get any people in trouble but I know

592
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,870
people personally and there are

593
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,790
companies in

594
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,439
Colorado that will ship CBD products

595
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,089
nationwide you can be in Maine name in

596
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,750
California and they will send you a

597
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:20,399
bottle of CBD t-shirt uh how are those

598
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,799
people that were relying on those

599
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,300
medicine what are they gonna do now

600
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,029
that's who I'm mainly worried about

601
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,759
they're screwed yeah but they were

602
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,879
always like their access was only

603
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,140
obtained through a gray market and if

604
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,090
they were paying attention they knew

605
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,110
that and they've been lobbying for a

606
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:43,339
different way to access whatever product

607
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:45,928
they desperately need in their area I

608
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:48,149
would love to say come to Colorado and

609
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:50,519
we've got CBD for you but there is a CBD

610
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,750
drought yep the only way like everybody

611
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,029
thinks they're gonna come to Colorado

612
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,579
and go to a medical dispensary and get

613
00:22:54,029 --> 00:23:01,019
Heidi CBD medicine and they are highly

614
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:03,899
disappointed there is not much yours is

615
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,460
expensive because it's it's there's a

616
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,140
shortage and there's been a shortage for

617
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,069
a while you've got to find yourself a

618
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,870
private caregiver

619
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,428
who they're trying to squeeze out of the

620
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:12,779
system now anyway or you've got a girl

621
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,059
yourself and then you've got to find a

622
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,950
CBD clone or you got to find seeds or

623
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:18,119
something high CBD and then you've got

624
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,029
to grow it and you've got to get it

625
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,319
tested or I don't know people focus a

626
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,849
little bit too much on testing when it

627
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,169
comes to personal medicine I think I'm

628
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:26,849
gonna do an episode on this I'm gonna

629
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,610
write this down I think that the

630
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,779
medicine I think if medicine works for

631
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,099
you it works for you don't pay attention

632
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,599
to the lab testing there's a lot of

633
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,279
elaboration I want to do on that but

634
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,259
we'll save it for another there's a lot

635
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,160
of stuff that lab testing brought to the

636
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,929
community that's just bizarre um people

637
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,860
focus on all the wrong numbers and

638
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:49,429
that's I mean I loved watching the CBD

639
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:53,369
industry explode over the last two years

640
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:55,530
I don't take that from what I'm saying

641
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:58,109
because I think that should be available

642
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:59,940
to everyone everywhere I think this

643
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:02,099
society would be a lot better if more

644
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,190
people were adding CBD to their diets

645
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:07,678
regularly as a supplement it helps with

646
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,600
a bunch of stuff I'm a huge CBD advocate

647
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,440
I use it daily what's your daily dose of

648
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,449
CBD right now I'm restricting myself

649
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,808
because the product I'm using I'm

650
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:21,808
limited on accessing any more of it ever

651
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:23,579
won't happen it's gone the person that's

652
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:25,980
making it is gone and so I'm kind of

653
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:29,128
making it lasts always the worst part

654
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:33,179
about the products yep and right now I'm

655
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:35,369
at two or three CBD dad's a day okay um

656
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:37,048
and I spaced them throughout the day and

657
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,668
it depends if I'm not hurting that day

658
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:41,970
maybe I only take one maybe I'll take

659
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:43,769
just a little itty-bitty one maybe I'll

660
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:48,149
just use some of the pain cream I've got

661
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:51,769
left and started but that's on purpose

662
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:54,599
I'm purposefully going slow before then

663
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:57,149
or like when I was taking it is

664
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,048
milligram pills it was 50 milligrams a

665
00:24:57,148 --> 00:25:03,449
day you take 25 in morning 25 at night I

666
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:05,249
was my next question okay 25 so 25 to

667
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,528
keep you pain-free a day 25 to get you

668
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:09,990
sleeping through the night well just

669
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:12,118
making it easy cuz I never kind of went

670
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,638
wild with it because I liked it half and

671
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:17,519
half THC CBD and I didn't want to be

672
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:20,099
eating 50 milligrams of THC before like

673
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,440
I went out and did my day so I was

674
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:25,469
keeping it 225 and then adding more

675
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,720
during the day if I needed to okay but I

676
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,519
can consume human huge amounts of CBD

677
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,179
when I'm hurting like I've got an issue

678
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,769
with two of the vertebrae in my back and

679
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:36,509
it doesn't happen often but every now

680
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:39,028
and then they twang off each other kind

681
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:41,839
of like a rubber band and that feeling

682
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:45,628
is pretty excruciating and then the area

683
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,839
around where those two twang will get

684
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:50,428
inflamed and hurt for several days and

685
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,240
to a degree where I can't really bend

686
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:56,460
her work and if I feel its twang and I

687
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,919
eat a whole bunch of CBD likes cuz 300

688
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,480
milligrams right away it won't inflame

689
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,419
to the point where I'm down the next day

690
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,610
that's I was yeah I've heard a lot about

691
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,679
if you get on it as soon as you feel it

692
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:09,868
yep like as soon as you feel it get that

693
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
like get that CBD edible in you and if

694
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:15,569
you can take a dab because dab is it's

695
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,569
instant absorption yeah dab is instant

696
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:20,428
not just dabbing but any inhalation

697
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:21,868
through the lungs that that makes it to

698
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,840
the bloodstream incredibly quickly

699
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:27,449
you'll get relief in seconds yep it's

700
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,859
it's seconds and if you eat it you're

701
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,440
looking at I mean half hour

702
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:34,298
hour and a half two hours before you

703
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,140
you've got full effect to what you've

704
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:39,670
consumed the effect of what you eat is

705
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,360
gonna be a little stronger but that

706
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,009
delayed if you're taking it for pain you

707
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:50,529
can't wait two hours for your pain

708
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:55,000
totally kick in right but CBD was never

709
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:56,170
legal in all 50 states like you just

710
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,170
called that back like a professional

711
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,480
Khadijah

712
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,720
it was a loophole that everybody was

713
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,429
operating under and I mean it was so

714
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,950
glaringly obvious a loophole that

715
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:13,750
Chinese companies know fall over it and

716
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,130
obviously that was gonna get shut down

717
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,269
at some point and that's not even what

718
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:21,220
this was this was this was just the DEA

719
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,839
assigning its own serial number for when

720
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,429
they do seizures they didn't even

721
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,839
release a letter saying we're gonna go

722
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,440
after the people selling this [ __ ]

723
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:32,109
online it's just a reminder that all

724
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,330
parts of the cannabis plant are illegal

725
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,969
most of our community is still not

726
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:38,199
politically aware let alone radically

727
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,640
active but that's what we're here for

728
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,240
that's why I bring you on Mike because

729
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,640
you can remind them you can try to huge

730
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,200
I mean huge segments of the population

731
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,929
not just the marijuana community got

732
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,539
this story wrong I'm freaked out about

733
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,580
it and they're tying it to every

734
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:57,970
conspiracy theory there is against

735
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:01,750
marijuana legalization like I read a

736
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:04,000
whole on a fairly reputable news site it

737
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,190
was an opinion piece that they chose to

738
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,579
publish about because they used the

739
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,529
marijuana with an H spelling in this

740
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:14,649
that it was that was because Trump was

741
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:17,259
elected in racism is now openly accepted

742
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,480
and that this was a medication or the

743
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:22,750
DEA was gonna round up the stoners and

744
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,870
the Mexicans and this was published in a

745
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,210
pen and I'm reading this like okay Jesus

746
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:30,668
like we've come so far we've just had a

747
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,298
huge night on election night marijuana

748
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:37,030
won big in so many places in the first

749
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:40,450
thing we do to celebrate is give

750
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:42,579
ourselves a black eye and then another

751
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,340
in another in another in another

752
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:48,639
another and we didn't need a fake news

753
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:53,528
shitstorm this week there's enough real

754
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,700
news that we should be focused on and

755
00:28:53,528 --> 00:29:01,119
because so much of our community isn't

756
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:03,308
aware of the legalities nationally for

757
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:06,459
this plan we all love this stories

758
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:10,240
spread like wildfire I've seen half a

759
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,220
dozen businesses down here post it and

760
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,569
it's like you're a marijuana store you

761
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,860
should have known this better than I

762
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:19,869
right yeah yeah the businesses the CBD

763
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:22,839
businesses that we're sending this [ __ ]

764
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:24,668
through the mail their lawyers should

765
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,250
have made this perfectly clear to them

766
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:30,070
that they're operating in a legal gray

767
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,038
area through a loophole in a [ __ ]

768
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:35,109
farm bill I mean that as far as the feds

769
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,210
are concerned all parts of the cannabis

770
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:40,928
plant are illegal regardless of THC

771
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:43,659
content it can be just the root ball of

772
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:45,639
a hemp plant that dried up or the most

773
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,380
harvested two years ago and it's still

774
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:50,709
illegal you can still be charged for the

775
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,380
federal crime for having it wow that's

776
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,028
scary yep and that's that's just the

777
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,159
reality of our situation that's why I

778
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:59,638
have so much respect for even though the

779
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:02,169
marijuana business owners I really hate

780
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:04,839
because they're standing up and risking

781
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,860
a lot for us for everybody yep shoutout

782
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,408
to everyone in the marijuana industry

783
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:09,490
working hard every day getting it going

784
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,470
alright so we've talked a lot about this

785
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,028
DEA letter it's been a long so I hope

786
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:19,659
that clears that up and calms you down

787
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:21,909
ideas send your yes and all the positive

788
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:25,330
stuff can grow from your heart at

hotmail.com alright so thanks for

790
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:28,509
listening to the DEA part we're gonna

791
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:30,069
move on to a little bit of updating

792
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:34,148
stuff of things we've talked about in

793
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:38,798
the past because um on our post-election

794
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:40,778
episode we mentioned that a a it was the

795
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,908
little bit of bad news we had for for

796
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:45,970
Pueblo for our election night there was

797
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:49,179
a election question should we allow

798
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,620
retail marijuana stores inside Pueblo

799
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,610
city what's it called on the ballot

800
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:52,779
what's that initial

801
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:54,719
is that an initiative is that what I

802
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:58,599
voted on what's the thing I voted on

803
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,750
initiative amendment there I think I

804
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,519
remember which one the question is how I

805
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,609
tend to defer to it we thought it did

806
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,609
not pass on Allah when we recorded our

807
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:13,599
post-election show it was it was failing

808
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:15,039
by like 150 or 200 votes and by the time

809
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,019
they got all of the provisional ballots

810
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,200
counted and all the ballots that were

811
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:24,190
stuck together and what not counted we

812
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,279
won by like 5 or 600 votes nice so we

813
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,720
will be able to have recreational

814
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:33,190
cannabis stores within the city limits

815
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,839
of Pueblo um December 27th I believe the

816
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,910
City Council is the Tuesday after

817
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:42,579
Christmas city council will be voting on

818
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:46,000
the final rules and regs package for Rex

819
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:48,990
Rex shops I have learned a good mood

820
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,990
after their Christmas break

821
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:55,869
unfortunately I've been involved with

822
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,610
this for a long time so I know way more

823
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:58,659
about it than I should even the people

824
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,539
that are working on it right now I

825
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,070
probably know more about it than they do

826
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:06,639
the ordinance that they're about to vote

827
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:08,859
and probably pass on passed into law was

828
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,559
written by a Zoning Commission that was

829
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:16,058
very dead set against allowing marijuana

830
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:18,730
businesses in the city at all and in a

831
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:22,720
certain point they discovered that with

832
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,579
one or two zoning buffer rules so 1,000

833
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,190
feet from schools and 300 feet from

834
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:29,259
residences that they could essentially

835
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,990
limit the number of marijuana businesses

836
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:33,339
in the city to about a dozen because

837
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,279
that's all the property that's

838
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:38,289
physically available it makes sense yeah

839
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,048
if they they include those two buffer

840
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:43,269
zones and to make that even more

841
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:45,039
restrictive they've decided to limit the

842
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:47,740
total number of stores in the city to

843
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,269
eight for north of the river for south

844
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,910
of the river they've the city is

845
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,429
preparing for a wave of applications and

846
00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:00,910
they've come up with a point system in a

847
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:03,550
timeline for that application process to

848
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,080
take place so hopefully by the end of

849
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,409
the year we've got at least a couple of

850
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,329
reach

851
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,440
marijuana shops open in puebla that'd be

852
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:11,169
cool

853
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,330
yeah I I wish the the rules were that

854
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,269
we're about to pass are different or

855
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:19,750
we're different are different but that's

856
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:21,430
very unlikely I'm doing what I can to

857
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,029
get some of the craziness tweet taken

858
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:26,100
out of them but there's only so much

859
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:28,660
changed at their wound to make right now

860
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:31,119
they're catching on they're kind of

861
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,490
slowly evolving so this is a very

862
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,789
different City Council than the one we

863
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:39,099
had a year or two years ago I mean this

864
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:43,000
is a full process that started four

865
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:44,919
years ago it's been four full years that

866
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,950
the city has been working on this

867
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,630
particular set of rules and regs that's

868
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,090
how long I've been working on it do you

869
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,680
think since we had the first shop do you

870
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:57,909
think we could get just first in line

871
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,920
like hey yeah nope believe me back come

872
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,050
on just play that card okay we was here

873
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,820
most of that part of the city is blacked

874
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:06,579
out due to schools because the

875
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:10,630
thousand-foot from schools rule isn't

876
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:14,159
just classrooms where their students if

877
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:17,140
the college owns an empty apartment on

878
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,379
whatever street then there's a thousand

879
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:22,690
foot buffer around that apartment around

880
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,410
that empty apartments property line yeah

881
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,240
yeah does the library in such count not

882
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,839
for not for these this rule package

883
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:37,959
tends not to matter um there were

884
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,570
several other buffer zones listed around

885
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,550
our medical shops which is why they've

886
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:46,169
been allowed with no store cap for four

887
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,169
or five years and we only have three

888
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,970
I'm rezoning rules you can really limit

889
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,220
the allowed businesses in an area and

890
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:57,189
this is why if your area passed

891
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:00,789
legalization recently you really need to

892
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,349
brush up on local politics and get down

893
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:04,139
to planning and zoning in City Council

894
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:06,279
or County Commission meetings now

895
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,719
because these rules are being decided

896
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,720
for your area right now

897
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:16,210
I mean if you're not involved people who

898
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:18,190
do give a [ __ ] enough to show up it's

899
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,900
their voice that helps craft these rules

900
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,240
and if it's two people that really hate

901
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,160
weed for one reason or another in one

902
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:28,569
person that loves weed but is really an

903
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,920
articulate expect ugly rules yeah if you

904
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,420
know how to grow and you were all about

905
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,889
talking with City Council go down there

906
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,510
represent them tell them why they're

907
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:36,099
there guidelines aren't gonna work for a

908
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,480
typical girl yep

909
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:41,170
you know I was thinking about I think uh

910
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,289
I cannot recall buying cannabis in a

911
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,900
Pueblo dispensary since the legalization

912
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,340
of recreational cannabis that's the last

913
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,460
time I can remember shopping in a Pueblo

914
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:54,730
dispensary I rarely shop in a store but

915
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm not sure to get out to the stores as

916
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,199
often as possible just to see what

917
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:04,420
everybody's doing but as far as supply

918
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:09,699
goes well I know your caregiver he does

919
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:11,920
a good job this casting a shatter is yes

920
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:15,069
yes and also our good friends at elevate

921
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,360
glass and and so uh that was the good

922
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,800
Pueblo news that we screwed up on

923
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,660
election night that was our big blooper

924
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,830
from that show yes the next thing I've

925
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:22,359
got written down you can see it it says

926
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:25,750
Maine if you want to tell us about Maine

927
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,970
go for Maine Maine voted to legalize

928
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:31,409
recreational marijuana the vote passed

929
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:34,269
by a very very very very slim margin

930
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:35,379
like statewide it was like fifteen

931
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,969
hundred twelve hundred votes or

932
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,650
something it was very very close

933
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:42,849
so the anti-pop people forced a recount

934
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,960
costing the state half a million bucks

935
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:50,980
that recount is underway now it's paused

936
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,070
for the weekend they've counted all of

937
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,800
the cities in county areas that the

938
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,720
anti-pop people were sure we're gonna

939
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,000
give them the numbers to reverse the

940
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:05,739
vote and the the outcome hasn't changed

941
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,750
legalization is still winning

942
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,659
and the really funny part of the story

943
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,909
to me is uh so in Maine the election

944
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:16,059
rules if you push for a recount and you

945
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:18,009
get it the pro side and the anti side

946
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:21,730
for whatever issues getting recounted

947
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,819
have to send ten volunteers every day to

948
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,039
the recount

949
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:26,978
office like you know it still cost the

950
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,449
state half a million dollars to do this

951
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:33,228
even with using volunteers from the

952
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:35,289
campaigns and the anti-pop people in

953
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:39,918
Maine can't get ten people to show up

954
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:41,259
every day and so the the recounts taken

955
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:43,879
a lot longer than it should have

956
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:47,478
election staffers have had to stand in

957
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,309
and cover for anti legalization

958
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:52,838
volunteers that weren't able to make it

959
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:54,859
on time or were late several days a

960
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,478
couple days in a row when this first

961
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,409
started and it just happened again here

962
00:37:56,478 --> 00:38:00,678
at the end of the week they didn't have

963
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:03,228
enough people show luckily the pro pot

964
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,709
people have had extra volunteers willing

965
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:08,358
to work and have been willing to work

966
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:11,028
some longer hours to make sure that this

967
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:13,639
gets recounted correctly correctly and

968
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:15,318
accurately so that the recount is still

969
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,118
on tractive to finish up when it's

970
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,498
supposed to

971
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,919
but the anti pot people were so

972
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:23,238
convinced that they had this in the bag

973
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:26,418
I'm so convinced that they had the

974
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:28,188
majority of people that they forced the

975
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:29,509
recount in a million 1/2 million in

976
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:31,548
taxes to be spent they can't even get

977
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:33,769
ten volunteers that's funny come on now

978
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:38,329
how many how many things are still being

979
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:40,728
recounted nationwide um total election

980
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:44,959
why there's a bunch but it's all little

981
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:46,158
stuff okay it's statewide issues there

982
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:48,228
well there aren't that many that are

983
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,900
still accounts for full weeks right

984
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:52,998
since the election recounting is a huge

985
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,959
process because it's done by hand and

986
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:59,328
basically so in Maine the ten people

987
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:02,838
from each side pair up and then they're

988
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:04,039
given an election an election person and

989
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,389
then those three people go sit at the

990
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:10,640
table and you look at the ballot in both

991
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:13,818
of the the Pro and the anti people agree

992
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,379
that that's a yes vote and the third guy

993
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,058
they're from the Election Commission is

994
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,929
there to make sure that the to the anti

995
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:24,319
and the pro people don't fight nice and

996
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:26,539
follow the rules yeah I mean I mean this

997
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,038
prayer it takes an insane amount of time

998
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,900
on election night they're just funneling

999
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,880
these [ __ ] throwing machine and you

1000
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,709
can do thousands a minute or thousands a

1001
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,369
second unless you're pueblos crash your

1002
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,368
[ __ ] shitty service

1003
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:44,670
but the recount is an incredibly taxing

1004
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:47,190
process but there aren't that many that

1005
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:49,230
are still going I'm typically by now one

1006
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,510
side is gone okay the vote clearly

1007
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,840
hasn't changed we're down to just the

1008
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,780
tiny towns or the areas that voted

1009
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,240
strongly one way or the other it's not

1010
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,750
gonna matter let's let's let it go and

1011
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,789
they've conceded at this point the anti

1012
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,110
pot thing or the anti pot group in Maine

1013
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:09,900
is one of the few holdouts that are

1014
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,450
still fighting they don't have a chance

1015
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,190
um so what this means if you happen to

1016
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:17,399
listen to the podcast and you live in

1017
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:20,099
Maine Way first shout out for listening

1018
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,039
we appreciate it I'm second get involved

1019
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,420
locally cuz in a couple of weeks when

1020
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,259
all this is said and done and it's

1021
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,480
official and marijuana is legal um at

1022
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,910
best you're gonna be talking to local

1023
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,710
government officials who will be saying

1024
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:38,069
over and over and over again well the

1025
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:40,320
vote was really close so we hear what

1026
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:42,960
both sides are saying we're gonna give

1027
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,370
the anti pot people nine out of the ten

1028
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,260
things they want and we're gonna give

1029
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:48,239
the pro marijuana people 1 out of the 10

1030
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,580
things they want because it was a close

1031
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,109
vote and if you don't get on top of it

1032
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,809
now and figure out exactly how these

1033
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,150
rules get made in your area I mean

1034
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:59,549
you're gonna be driving a really long

1035
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,130
distance to the only dispensary in your

1036
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,110
area and it's gonna be crazy expensive

1037
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:07,340
to buy weed though if it's mean it won't

1038
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:10,320
be that far then it's still cold I

1039
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:13,260
honestly have no idea exactly how big

1040
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,990
that state is but I don't want to drive

1041
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,490
45 minutes to the weed store no I don't

1042
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:19,169
want to drive 20 minutes to it doesn't

1043
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:20,969
mean you gotta drive 45 minutes home

1044
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,099
before you can smoke that new weed yep

1045
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:24,599
and if there's I mean you just give me a

1046
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,980
nostalgic feeling remember one needs to

1047
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,769
go to the dispensary I don't have it now

1048
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,210
I'm sorry I'm jaded but I remember the

1049
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,309
feeling I just took a fat debut guys I

1050
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,949
apologize for the chokes while Mike was

1051
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,029
on his rant there I took a couple dabs

1052
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,859
remember you just go to the dispensary

1053
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,260
and you'd be like oh you want one here I

1054
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,360
got you man I've got the hash if you've

1055
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,490
got a dad to love the carp cap yeah you

1056
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,110
just done don't use that email because

1057
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:48,149
it's kind of Chloe's dit to be quiet and

1058
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,460
I use a torch all right there's a dab

1059
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,309
there's a dabber there's torch and

1060
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,199
here's rigged with a bucket

1061
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:56,369
yes stranded to our friends at elevate

1062
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,599
for keeping me stocked up on fresh

1063
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:03,420
bangers remember that feeling when he

1064
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,949
would go to the lake I would I would do

1065
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,329
Rob kind of a nerd I would do research

1066
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:08,399
online and find out what the hottest

1067
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:10,049
strains are in Denver or in Colorado and

1068
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,460
I would go find that if it was a Bruce

1069
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,710
Banner I'd go find where they had some

1070
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,480
Bruce Banner what was the strain that

1071
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,610
they had at the Denver relief they had

1072
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,730
the biodiesel I don't know if they're

1073
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:26,849
got the biodiesel the vortex that's not

1074
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:30,389
from TGA sub cool I was going to the

1075
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:33,539
clinic on Mexico in Denver and I was

1076
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:34,739
getting the vortex wax and I would say

1077
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:36,210
how much do you have of that and they'd

1078
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:38,279
say this much and I'd say I'll take it

1079
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,650
yeah they started setting limits because

1080
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,880
it means any purchase but I remember the

1081
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,470
first week they put those purchase

1082
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,789
limits in place the girls screwed up

1083
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:51,719
when we were there and we still bought

1084
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:53,579
it all yeah thanks Brittany yeah we do

1085
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,219
that was actually when I bought my

1086
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,569
hitman rig but uh so I remember the

1087
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:58,799
feeling I would get when I was leaving e

1088
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,359
to spin through with that specific

1089
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,850
strain that I was so excited about going

1090
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,230
to find it's like like skip it's like

1091
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,940
almost the feeling was a little kidding

1092
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,740
I'd get a new video game whenever the

1093
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,539
new Zelda or Super Mario came out and

1094
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:11,699
I'm like oh I got it I gotta go home and

1095
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:13,500
show my friends and you'd go home and

1096
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:14,819
call one of your buddies and this is the

1097
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,710
same thing would happen with weed he'd

1098
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,090
go home and call your friends like bro

1099
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,740
Mike you gotta come over like got some

1100
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,600
biodiesel bro you gotta come check it

1101
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,699
out and you'd drive over and I'd try to

1102
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,170
keep that Jar Jar closed until you got

1103
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:25,949
here so that when I cracked it open it

1104
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,130
was just [ __ ] Oh

1105
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:30,599
biodiesel in the face and then we grind

1106
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,550
a little bit of it up and smoke it

1107
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,009
together to be like that anticipation

1108
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,180
from the car to the house of like oh god

1109
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,000
just mike meet me at the house don't

1110
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:42,960
even make me wait bro I missed the drive

1111
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,969
home from picking up weed for sure hmm

1112
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,960
when that was like an hour 20 minute

1113
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:52,069
drive that was stressful like by the

1114
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,240
time you got home that adrenaline high

1115
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,280
you're not allowed to take more Dan's on

1116
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,359
the show

1117
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,360
was a good one but that adrenaline high

1118
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:08,700
from driving home with a bag of weed and

1119
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:10,920
then sitting down the sweet reward it's

1120
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:12,809
like I finally made it and it was like

1121
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,240
you I felt like I almost it was more of

1122
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:17,130
a reward I used to get higher than like

1123
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,019
cuz you had that like oh I [ __ ] did it

1124
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,700
I went because it used to be a struggle

1125
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,489
it used to be a mission a STONER mission

1126
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,809
you'd have to find do you have weed

1127
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:26,279
there'd be two or three guys would be

1128
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:28,199
that first guy you'd always want to try

1129
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,610
and he was my friend with bad eyes and

1130
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,379
his name started with a a if your if

1131
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:33,150
your my Korean hoped I might hit that

1132
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,430
guy first all the time see if he's got

1133
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,110
that Sour Diesel if not and try a couple

1134
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:38,730
other dudes but if you got to find out

1135
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,110
where they are if they got what you want

1136
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,130
and if they can meet you somewhere then

1137
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,690
you got to meet up somewhere and you got

1138
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,730
to sit in a sketchy parking lot or go to

1139
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,150
a sketchy house and then you got to get

1140
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:50,579
it I always had three or four people and

1141
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,099
on my way to work I would head up my

1142
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,869
favorite and my lunch if I ain't heard

1143
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,730
back I would head up the other two yep

1144
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:58,889
there you go by the end of the day

1145
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,230
guaranteed one of them would have hit me

1146
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:05,960
back and then I'd go way too sketchy

1147
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:10,199
parking lot yep I don't miss those days

1148
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,849

1149
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:15,089

1150
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:18,259
anticipation but I feel it every time

1151
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:22,559

1152

money in the world like there's nothing

to do what [ __ ]

1200

1205
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,709
before he goes - sir do you have

1206
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:27,419
marijuana in there because he could

1207
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,829
smell it yeah and I just looked him

1208
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,780
straight in the face and I said yeah

1209
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:32,519

00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,970
offended like I can smell your weed over

1293
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,769
the burgers in the skirted heifer and

1294
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:35,569
listeners yes I am a vegetarian the

1295
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:37,599
scripted heifer serves a quinoa burger

1296
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:41,269
that is marvelous so don't get me wrong

1297
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,130
I don't blame restaurants with like I

1298
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:44,989
don't care what you do for work all day

1299
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,059
if you're if you're funky you know from

1300
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:49,039
it to funk out a whole restaurant

1301
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:50,509
you probably shouldn't go straight from

1302
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:55,219
work to the restaurant like I don't care

1303
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:57,200
what you do or why you stink some

1304
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,929
restaurants back in the day when I

1305
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,789
noticed before we had legal cannabis

1306
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:03,379
legalization and it was a known thing I

1307
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:04,730
would show up to restaurants with my

1308
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,079
scuzzy looking friends because I know

1309
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,619
I'm not the cleanest looking person I

1310
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,690
bathe on a regular basis yes but I do

1311
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:13,730
look like - Bacchus [ __ ] baby cousin

1312
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,530
I've got dreadlocks past my ass almost

1313
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,510
to my knees I've got a fuzzy beard you

1314
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,300
can hear it that's my beard I got a

1315
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:22,190
goatee I got a mustache I wore a crooked

1316
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,019
hat and a t-shirt and Dickies and

1317
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,400
skateboard shoes and I walk into

1318
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:27,199
restaurants and back in the day and I

1319
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,789
smell like wheat I just constantly smell

1320
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,250
like herb if I'm growing it smoking it

1321
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:32,929
whatever I smell like cannabis I would

1322
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,400
walk into restaurants and they would

1323
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:36,679
kind of roll their eyes and be like [ __ ]

1324
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,480
let's sit these weirdos in a corner now

1325
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:41,359
that the industry is the way that it is

1326
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,909
they know that kids it look like myself

1327
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,920
and you and Kev bro and whoever else

1328
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:47,869
used to roll with me to places they

1329
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,369
treat us like [ __ ] rock stars now bro

1330
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,710
in the grimy Gatsby and I would go to

1331
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:53,539
dinner in Colorado Springs that waitress

1332
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,980
would be up our butts cuz they know it's

1333
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:56,659
like these are weed industry people and

1334
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,449
they get paid well I'm gonna be super

1335
00:51:56,659 --> 00:52:03,679
[ __ ] nicely that's not they get paid

1336
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:07,189
well they get paid well now and in the

1337
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:10,309
near future in the very recent past they

1338
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:14,050
worked a job where tips or at least

1339
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:17,179
service was a big part of it right um so

1340
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,860
when we go out to eat now we understand

1341
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:21,289
that the person serving us our food is

1342
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:24,590
making less than minimum wage and that

1343
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:26,570
if one or two of her table stiffs are

1344
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:29,269
throughout a shift she's gonna have

1345
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:31,760
trouble making ends meet and so if the

1346
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:33,949
service is good we always overt it yeah

1347
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,560
yeah just as a community we kind of take

1348
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:38,639
care of it I can always when I was doing

1349
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,159
food service I could always tell

1350
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,170
which one of my tables which customers

1351
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,149
also worked in the services right I've

1352
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:47,340
heard every one of my foodservice

1353
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,220
friends has said that before yep you can

1354
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:52,110
always tell and you can tell who's like

1355
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:53,219
no one and their families work in the

1356
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,050
service industry in a couple of

1357
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:59,039
generations but you can tell those

1358
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:00,600
[ __ ] too from a mile away and it I

1359
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,599
mean it makes a big difference if you're

1360
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,710
a server to know who to treat a little

1361
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,079
better I love it when you take a girl

1362
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,490
out to dinner when the dinner is over

1363
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,559
she starts gathering plates and sets

1364
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:12,269
them at the edge of the table like I did

1365
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,920

1386
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,910
how the cannabis actually works for you

1387
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,380
yeah and that reminds me that I want to

1388
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:04,379

1392
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:17,099
sort of a dudebro sort of side of things

1393
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:18,959
I understand that that is that's who I

1394
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:20,940
am and I please don't ask me to change

1395
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,309

1396
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,980
culture dab kids sort of thing that

1397
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:28,110
we've got going on here bone Ellis has a

1398
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:32,360
great podcast called the spliff podcast

1399
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:34,230
and she does it from a much more I

1400
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,730
described it kind of like as it's

1401
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:38,789
learning cannabis from my kindergarten

1402
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,139
teacher but she's [ __ ] educated and

1403
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:41,759
she is learning more and more as she

1404
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:44,639
goes on with the podcast she will talk

1405
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,420
much more about specific cannabinoid

1406
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,920
dosing for specific conditions and she

1407
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,260
should call some of her episodes a

1408
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,269
hundred and one ways to use mic

1409
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,400
an abyss because I'm all about dabbing

1410
00:54:54,269 --> 00:54:57,719
excuse me I'm all about taking dads I'm

1411
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,389
all about smoking some flowers I like

1412
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:03,359
some edibles bo doesn't waste a thing

1413
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:04,859
she uses every bit of cannabinoids she

1414
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,870
can pull out of everything and I

1415
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,440
appreciate it that's just not my style I

1416
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:12,269
know someone locally that they were the

1417
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,800
first person I ever met that was juicing

1418
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:18,869
raw cannabis like when they D foliate

1419
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,690
okay take all that leaf material and

1420
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:24,029
juice as long as they toss the crunchy

1421
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:26,940
but when they do foliate is the grain

1422
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,530
they juice all that grande material

1423
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,429
which uses the stuff that she's

1424
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,260
vaporized

1425
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,909
she makes a teacher with coconut oil out

1426
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,010
of that or a topical with coconut oil

1427
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:37,379
out of that she makes a cannabis lotion

1428
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:40,050
she has been making cannabis products

1429
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,460
for her cats recently like so if you

1430
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,500
guys want a different perspective on

1431
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,119
cannabis if you get tired of hearing our

1432
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,650
bro culture over here which I understand

1433
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,759
some people aren't into being called

1434
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,079
dude and bro on the listen to a podcast

1435
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,730
all the time but if you've gotten this

1436
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,960
far and you must be into us but if you

1437
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:54,260
want some more a different perspective

1438
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,369
on cannabis from a very well-educated

1439
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,500
professional sounding woman if you want

1440
00:55:56,369 --> 00:56:00,599
a woman's perspective on cannabis I

1441
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,789
highly recommend listening to the spliff

1442
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,409
podcast from bone Ellis she does not pay

1443
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:06,989

1444
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:08,219

yes and pot not pod right it took me

1451
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:27,149
like a week to find this podcast just

1452
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:28,949
because I was hearing split and PAH okay

1453
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,420
and I thought it was the split podcast

1454
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:35,069
like this isn't a thing

1455
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:38,340
spliff SPL iff the spliff podcast p OTC

1456
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:40,350
AST and her name is bo bo h nellis and

1457
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,570
she's a great host she's a cool person

1458
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:44,880
Bo one day I hope we get to take a DAB

1459
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,130
together that'd be fun I'm gonna make

1460
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,690
you take like a half gram Dada make you

1461
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:51,329
choke forever because that's how I do it

1462
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,500
but you guys you would appreciate this

1463
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:55,319
show if you like my show I feel like

1464
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,690
you'll like buzz show she is got 63

1465
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,539
episodes up right now nice I am

1466
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:02,039
30-something episodes in and they're

1467
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:05,869
getting better and better as they go

1468
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:08,730
she's really good at recommending

1469
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:12,750
specific dosages of cannabinoids and

1470
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:14,309
she's much uh she doesn't over consume

1471
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:18,570
cannabis the way that I do

1472
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:20,670
so she's much more on the beginner

1473
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:23,280
consumer side which I'm not even bashing

1474
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:25,200
anybody I miss my lower tolerance right

1475
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,630
I was able to do some really amazing

1476
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,049
things with some low-dose cannabinoid

1477
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:33,090
changes and most of that spectrum I'm a

1478
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:35,130
little ridiculous I'm Chewbacca's

1479
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:37,829
freakin cousin and I like to over dab I

1480
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,360
like to overmedicate so if you but

1481
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,559
that's enough of a shoutout for Bo I

1482

[ __ ] great I like it so that's

1484
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:46,050
something that I wrote down and then

1485
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,190
we're gonna read an article about

1486
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:51,600
particles per million and Colorado

1487
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,700

1488
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,929
ppm Ross yes because I think it's

1489
00:57:53,699 --> 00:58:02,309
something that needs to be talked about

1490
00:57:54,929 --> 00:58:04,469
you got now or to stick around make sure

1491

1492
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:11,039
really try to dedicate an hour or more

1494

facility that I'm working with it is a

1523
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:33,810

1524
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,820
all of the layers every day and it's

1525
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:38,789
cold it's colder than than it was all

1526

00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:41,400
here

1528
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,409

1631

1638
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:56,730
contribute one dollar per month then

1639
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:59,759
every month on the 1st of the month

1640
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:02,070
isn't $1 to the podcast and that will

1641
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,420
help me not have to cover all the cost

1642
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,590
of the podcast out of my pocket

1643
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,659
everybody that shows up for the show

1644
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,890
gets a bottle of water I try to buy

1645
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:09,960
these little microphone covers these

1646
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:11,519
things here I try to replace these quite

1647
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,840
frequently because you guys coughing to

1648
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,059
them and they stink and I don't want

1649
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,650
people having to share that funky [ __ ]

1650
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:19,108
I've made that trip to the store with

1651
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:22,230
you yes yes and if you're really dying

1652
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:23,929
for old content this is a way to help

1653
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:26,369
make that happen

1654
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:28,139
reason it's not up there right now is

1655
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:30,900
because it would like double or triple

1656
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:34,289
the cost to maintain the web hosting to

1657
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,809
go all what are we 171 its 171 now you

1658
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:38,820
go 171 deep that kind of volume and

1659
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:40,769
storage cost a pretty penny I don't want

1660
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:47,640
to make that promise yet I've still got

1661
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:50,250
to get somebody did make the proper

1662
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:52,559
patreon contribution it may said post an

1663
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,730
old episode [ __ ] that's the way to

1664
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,759
get me to do what you want

1665
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:58,349
like money [ __ ] money talks it's

1666
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,589
Christmas time and money talks it's

1667
01:04:58,349 --> 01:05:03,030
armsan but yeah but I'm not trying to be

1668
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:04,949
that way I'm saying one dollar goes a

1669
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:07,349
long way if you don't have a dollar to

1670
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:08,939
contribute I do not I do I'm not

1671
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:10,200
offended I still love you I still want

1672
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,539
you to listen I still want you to grow

1673
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:15,029
amazing cannabis I do this so that when

1674
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:17,338
I'm old and too tired to do this like on

1675
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:19,019
our own that I'm hoping that enough

1676
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:21,179
people know how to do it well that I can

1677
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:22,559
just hit a store buy at a reasonable

1678
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,799
price that's a good way to look at it I

1679
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,469
guess

1680
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,030
that's all I want is that so by the time

1681
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:28,649
I'm too old to fight this fight anymore

1682
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:30,810
that it's taken care of enough for me to

1683
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,920
just enjoy the ride there you go all I'm

1684
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:32,909
asking for is help paying for the

1685
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,588
