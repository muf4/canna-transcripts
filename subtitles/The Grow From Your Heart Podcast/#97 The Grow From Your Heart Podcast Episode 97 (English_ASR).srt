10 years now ish maybe a little longer

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,899

extending the time closer to 7:00 okay

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,430
I'll give you definitely had to run the

23
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,650
time line which is why I know that

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,970
number a little faster okay I'll believe

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,280
you Mike says we've been in this

26
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,599
industry to get it a lot longer than

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,700
when you're tripping time kind of

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,789
stretches oh god it does and we've

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,219
trimmed a lot of you have trimmed a lot

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,799
of my herb for me I have so Mike's a

31
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:25,629
fellow cannabis activists a good friend

32
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,479
of mine and also a co-worker over at the

33
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:31,060
spot dispensary he's shaking his head

34
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,709
yes that is true that that's right what

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,969
I said is true I didn't ask question or

36
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,438
anything so there's no need for you to

37
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,609
respond other than a head shake was

38
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:37,809
appropriate but it was just funny to

39
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:39,519
watch you shake your head and think that

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,070
the people might have heard that speak

41
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,530
the truth yeah so he's a co-worker over

42
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,398

43

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,379
I do so today at the spot dispensary the

65
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:31,929
fire inspector the Puebla West Metro

66
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,849
fire inspector showed up and we've got

67
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,530
these big windows he did a fire

68
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,789
inspection and of course we passed I'm

69
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,669
gonna jump right to that we [ __ ]

70
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,539
passed I'm not even gonna do any

71
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,039
hesitation of that one we passed with

72
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,439
flying colors but here's the great part

73
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,049
we've got these big sliding doors they

74
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,780
go over some windows our facility is set

75
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,600
up to be a touring facility so we put

76
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,460
giant glass windows between the tour

77
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,719
area and where the plants will be so

78
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,210
that the plants will not become

79
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,159
contaminated by anything that our

80
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,050
touring people will come in with and

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,490
also they won't be able to touch the

82
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,100
plant so it keeps us completely

83
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,530
compliant and legal so we've designed

84
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,629
the facility to be tour prepared so

85
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,759
we've got these big giant windows would

86
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,159
you say they're 12 feet tall Mike easy

87
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,899
okay see 12 all right so these are big

88
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,150
eight by twelve I'm just getting there

89
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,629
about eight feet wide by about twelve

90
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,590
feet tall

91
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,789
big-ass panes of glass with gigantic

92
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,890
there are garage doors

93
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,560
but calling them garage doors down place

94
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,989
them yeah it's it's a good description

95
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,210
but I can't do better but yeah it

96
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,610
underplays significantly what we've got

97
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,310
here their garage doors made by Kodak

98
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,050
and they are used in the darkroom film

99
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,550
developing industry and the professional

100
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,800
film developing industry is what I was

101
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,480
told these doors are for so we've got

102
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,550
these grow rooms and of course in the

103
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,949
night cycle in the grow rooms we need a

104
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,719
hundred percent darkness and we need to

105
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,859
have that whenever the timer requires

106
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:59,800
that so these doors garage style doors

107
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,200
roll up and down on a little button and

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,880
it keeps the light out and it also maybe

109
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,349
we're doing something in there that we

110
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,849
don't want you to watch so maybe we can

111
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,139
close it down for privacy so the workers

112
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,780
can work in there without the tourists

113
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,849
see in that little area so the fire

114
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,500
inspector came and a big part of those

115
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,420
doors is their fire safety if there

116
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,879
happens to be a fire in that grow room

117
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,109
those doors will pop down the smoke

118
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,389
alarm will go off that when the smoke

119
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,120
alarm triggers a drop and those doors

120
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,620
all drop at one time and then the fire

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,269
hopefully is contained to that small

122
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,689
area and we can put it out

123
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:33,339
ah the fire inspector was walking around

124
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,569
he had his arms crossed trying to be

125
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,638
tough you know what I mean like the fire

126
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,500
inspector has to be a brute you can't be

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,750
a [ __ ] he has to hold his ground and be

128
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,519
a stern dude right and you can see the

129
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,658
look on his face like wow this is kind

130
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,639
of a nice facility

131
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,019
he was like checking it out like but he

132
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,699
was trying to not show it holding this

133
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,310
clipboard in his pan like a tough guy

134
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,689
and then he goes what I need to see is I

135
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,579
want you to trip one of these fire

136
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,348
alarms right here you just picked one

137
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,478
randomly and he goes I need all of these

138
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,918
doors to fall and we looked at each

139
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,389
other like they're gonna fall we've we

140
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,769
tested them all day yesterday we like

141
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,990
fine-tune this you know it's gonna work

142
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,719
he pushes the button and goes beep and

143
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,579
all the doors came down beautifully in

144
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,169
unison just it sounds like a train

145
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,939
starting up when they go down cuz

146
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:14,680
there's like 15 of these doors that

147
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,959
weigh 300 pounds each coming down on a

148
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,129
track and they just all perfectly in

149
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,629
unison and when they hit the floor

150
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,310
there's a little trigger that stops them

151
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,759
and like a hydraulic that makes him just

152
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,019
when they stopped and he uncrossed his

153
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,110
arms and looked around he goes I'm

154
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,448
impressed I'm gonna sign off like I win

155
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,370
signed our little fire paper thing so it

156
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,199
was so great to hear him the way you

157
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,728
impress the fire inspector you're doing

158
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,620
something right a lot of people have

159
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:40,568
worked really hard to get that piece of

160
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,360
paper signed that's absolutely true shot

161
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,550
at the Sam Sam was a big help that day

162
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,379
the Department of Agriculture told us

163
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,778
they were impressed because we are doing

164
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,459
what other people said is not possible

165
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:52,870

250
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,370
yeah okay but we're gonna freeze it like

251
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:01,000
rolling doing our pre-rolled joints we

252
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:04,629
do like a pound of worth at a time so

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,330
that's 450 joints and change and it

254
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,429
takes days to go from this is what we're

255
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,639
gonna pre-roll to here's what we have on

256
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,949
our pre-roll selection and the entire

257
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,809
time it's in the corner of the sales

258
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,190
floor so we have customers all day going

259
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:21,309
all do that looks like the best job ever

260
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,050
and it's not at all the best job ever it

261
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,939
would be if you could smoke one of them

262
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:26,589
the whole time you were rolling then it

263
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,390
wouldn't be so terrible but just just

264
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,070
sit there and rural joint after joint

265
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:32,350
after joint after joint after joint

266
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,760
without being able to smoke it your

267
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,220
hands get sticky you can't touch your

268
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,970

269
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,220
at work right now

270
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,410

306
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,610

307
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,588

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,220
prepared to do some work it's not gonna

314
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,360
just be playing with weed and that was

315
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,190
another thing I wanted to mention

316
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,600
somebody was talking about well you guys

317
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,589
are just hanging out smoking dope all

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,240
day no do we can't even smoke tobacco on

319
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,190
the property because it might look like

320
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,169
marijuana on the cameras and we don't

321
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,899
need that mess with the regulator's yes

322
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:27,699
we have to be I think the rule is a

323
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,919
thousand feet from the premises before

324
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,300
anybody is allowed to smoke in near any

325
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,299
dispensaries actually what I think the

326
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,169
technical rule is it may not be true but

327
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,719
that's what I don't know if there's a

328
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:40,689
like you can't smoke in public in like

329
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,459
parking lots or in public okay and as

330
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,529
far as on the dispensary premise goes

331
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,268
we're specifically barred from having

332
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:49,088
any sort of consumption a lot of yeah

333
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:52,179
pretty by state regulation that includes

334
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,500
all employees yep there's been just a

335
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,409
number of dispensaries that have been

336
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,208
fine because employees had like vape

337
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,639
cartridge pens in their purses and stuff

338
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:03,909
we're not supposed to have I can't have

339
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,679
my rig in my car no while I'm on the

340
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:08,110
clock if my car is in the parking lot at

341
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,278
the dispensary sorry guys I'm burping I

342
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,539
just opened up a fresh drink and I'm

343
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,399
burping it up all and recording here

344
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:15,069
while I'm in on the clock at the

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,860
dispensary working I can't have my fresh

346
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,690
shiny green Toro rigged in my case in my

347
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,250
backpack in the car so that when I get

348
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,380
off work I can drive over to Mike's

349
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,110
house and dab him out I can't have it

350
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:27,820
there or if I'm going to a concert or a

351
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,699
comedy show after work I can't have my

352
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,528
rig in my car so I have to uh I'm a

353
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:35,289
medical marijuana patient and sometimes

354
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:40,899
my back hurts sometimes I will have to

355
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:42,250
no no no no no no if I choose to if I

356
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,440
choose that I need to medicate during

357
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,500
working hours I have to drive home and

358
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,089
take a DAB eat lunch and then drive all

359
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,889
the way back to work because I can't

360
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,810
bring my damn backpack add a break to

361
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,610
work like shaking his head no like you

362
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,289
shouldn't say that but people have seen

363
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,730
my periscope they know that once in a

364
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,769
while I've dabbed in my lunch break

365
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,389
yeah by the time I get back to work it's

366
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,328
like a [ __ ] 30-minute drive back to

367
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,919
the middle of the desert right it is a

368
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:07,629
little annoying I have to leave town

369
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,370
every day for work I really have

370
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,039
commuted much further no that's good I

371
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,078
know more

372
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,909
shitty jobs it's a good drive to put on

373
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,519
some music and just jam out cuz it's a

374
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,528
fast drive it's mostly highway miles so

375
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,480
it's legit alright let's put this show

376
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,620
back on the damn road no we're not

377
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,050
allowed to smoke at work we're not

378
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,659
allowed to medicate anyone near the

379
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:28,219
building if you think about it it's when

380
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:31,129
you go to the liquor store like is the

381
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,560
clerk drunk like when you go to the gap

382
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:37,189
like FairPoint the kids probably dress

383
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,448
that aisle gap but like we go so far

384
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,610
with it at work that there's a special

385
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:43,099
protocol for employees buy we buy stuff

386
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,899
all day like every day there's at least

387
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,209
two employees that work that day buying

388
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,940
something but we've got special protocol

389
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:52,369
for it because if it's just like in my

390
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,009
car we can get in a lot of trouble for

391
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,409
it oh yeah like even if it's Alexis you

392
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:59,959
go in and you buy that diesel hash what

393
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:01,969
do you have to do with it it goes in the

394
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,989
safe until the end of the shift and then

395
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,500
right at the end of the night like

396
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,120
whereas for we locked the front door its

397
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,559
employees wanted anybody buying anything

398
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,139
and then we all queue up just like

399
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:15,439
custody okay right at the end of the

400
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:17,000
night yep and then it all gets sealed in

401
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,500
an exit bag like it does forever just

402
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,990
like so like we can't throw it in a

403
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,299
backpack or nothing like oh wow yeah cuz

404
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,269
it's all it's all official so that

405
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:28,219
there's told me not to even bring my

406
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,629
backpack yep once in a while I'm gonna

407
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,910
have to bring clothes and stuff because

408
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,198
I work in the back I'm required by the

409
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,269
Department of Agriculture to have a

410
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,588
change of at least one change of clothes

411
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,389
like all the way down to the underwear

412
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,880
and socks in a locker accessible because

413
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:42,230
I'm handling pesticides and other

414
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,240
chemicals and things so I need I'm

415
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,339
required to have a change of clothes but

416
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,990
they're like bringing is little backpack

417
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,730
and stuff as you need to bring here they

418
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,049
don't we don't want backpacks and [ __ ]

419
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,240
coming into the building we don't need

420
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:55,609
it on camera especially going to the

421
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,430
back there like please just don't like

422
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,230
yeah so I pretty much take what they

423
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:02,179
haven't think about mine because it

424
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,278
never leaves the security desk right

425
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,019
yeah I come I come in and it gets set on

426
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,399
the counter and it comes off the counter

427
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,750
again when I leave I go into the back

428
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,519
and it's like a labyrinth back there

429
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,750
there's all kinds of nooks and crannies

430
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,659
and there wouldn't be anywhere really to

431
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,309
put my backpack anyway so your locker it

432
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,379
wouldn't fit the lockers are only the

433
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:19,938
lawyers are teeny we go back there since

434
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,659
the lockers came in yeah they're per

435
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:23,009
size so if you got a purse

436
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,329
yeah that's what they're for all right

437
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:28,169
we're kind of way off topic here you

438
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,879
guys it's good I like it it's good it

439
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,529
was a really good week people that are

440
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,960
not from Colorado kind of like to hear

441
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,339
our our how our lives aren't what's

442
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,680
going on and since we're two dudes at

443
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,899
work it I is that's one of the fun part

444
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,049
dude come in every day and are just

445
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:47,039
blown the [ __ ] away about how regular it

446
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:48,059
is how many uh so I heard another person

447
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,019
asked this and I thought it would be

448
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,489
interesting and I was going to talk

449
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,559
about it in a future episode but since

450
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,440
you're here what's the breakdown of

451
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,569
people where they're from like how many

452
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,910
people are Colorado folk how many people

453
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,410
are from out of state and is there am i

454
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:03,449
talking [ __ ] when I say that probably

455
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:07,289
50% of the people that come in are from

456
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,940
Texas is that true yeah fully especially

457
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,099
if we do a breakdown over the if we're

458
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,750
talking about like that a year range

459
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,730
okay easily half the people that come

460
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,460
through most recreational dispensaries

461
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,560
are tourists that's statewide are in

462
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,129
places like Aspen it's like 80 or 90%

463
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,629
Wow um marijuana is crazy expensive up

464
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:28,379
there we get people from Aspen in our

465
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:29,850
shop it's crazy expensive in Aspen and

466
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,470
they're down in Pueblo because they were

467
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,899
driving through the area and weed Maps

468
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,580
told them to stop here go to the spot

469
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,350
yep and they get loaded up before they

470
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,000
head back to their city in Colorado

471
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,379
where it's way more expensive intercept

472
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,480
II nice um

473
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,970
but easily half the people that roll

474
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,159
through her from Texas its comes in

475
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,420
bizarre waves like I'm one day everybody

476
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,529
will be from Alabama the next day

477
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,959
everybody will be from Tennessee

478
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,779
yesterday it was Missouri and truckers

479
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,860
we actually have a busload I don't know

480
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,899
how they actually traveled there were

481
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,820
ten of them they come from Kansas and

482
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,230
they all come together and they all

483
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,970
would they always show up Tannen and

484
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,319
they come about once a month there are

485
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,230
ten of them that show up it's like a

486
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,849
field trip this kind of happens way more

487
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,160
often than you'd think like families

488
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,959
come through today there was a girl with

489
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,500
her grandmother and her grandmother just

490
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,380
had a filthy mouth after the dirty joke

491
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,180
and the granddaughter was mortified and

492
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,340
they're buying weed together like it's

493
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,600
we get [ __ ] like that constant that's

494
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,549
kind of neat yep

495
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,109
grandma and granddaughter buying her for

496
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,000
there and they're all blown away because

497
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,099
we have marijuana stores where you can

498
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,210
walk in and just like every other store

499
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,889
there's a salesperson there to tell you

500
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,929
all about it the biggest obstacle

501
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,820
throughout the shop is the security

502
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,190
guard you have to have an ID that says

503
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,569
you're 21 and if you got that go on in

504
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,830
to buy some he goes it'll be a second

505
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,538
and he makes sure that there's somebody

506
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:49,119
back there and he does go on back I

507
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:50,500
didn't even go buy weed yeah people

508
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,908
don't know what to think sometimes I

509
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,470
don't get to spend a lot of time upfront

510
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:55,240
because I'm supposed to be in the back

511
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,710
in the cave grow on the weed but

512
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,120
sometimes I got a venture up to the

513
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,009
front I got questions I gotta go find a

514
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,269
boss and now they're hard to find so I

515
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,740
just find myself in the bud room

516
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:05,168
watching and seeing what's going on and

517
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,819
a good portion of the people that I meet

518
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,350
are from out of state and they all see

519
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,970
the little board with the fins in it

520
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,500
they're like what's this I know I just

521
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,429
gave everybody in America like a weird

522
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,288
shitty southern accent everybody's from

523

525
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,519
in there and they're like I'll ride I

526
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:23,259

527

strain for her right now I have got to

589
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,900
I've started three phenotypes three

590
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,599
different strains from seed that I'm

591
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:31,690
going to phenotype from for her two of

592
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:34,359
those are now into flower they are about

593
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,090
48 hours into flower I think somewhere

608
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,970
depending on how much herb there is you

609
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,399
may get a little sample you may get a

610
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,980
sample of what gets selected because

611
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,870
there will be things that she likes that

612
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,460

makers of legal CBD hemp oil products

654

655
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,459
give them credit it's by Thomas H Clark

656
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,529
from the daily chronic I found it on the

657
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,808
daily chronic we will read the article

658
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,819
that goes a lot like this consumer

659
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:54,670
should beware purchasing and using any

660
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:56,230
such products the FDA says the Food and

661
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,000
Drug Administration has sent letters to

662
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,529
several makers of cannabidiol oils

663
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
derived from hemp telling them to stop

664
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,129
making medical claims about their

665
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,660
products ability to treat disease many

666
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,250
sellers of the hep base canna bidi all

667
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,080

668
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,179
legal in all 50 states because they are

669
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,710
derived from industrial hemp have been

670
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,080
making claims that their products are

671
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,509
rich in cannabidiol and can be used for

672
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,178
the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment

673
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:21,970
or a presentation of diseases according

674
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,410
to the FDA the FDA which considers CBD

675
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,690
an unapproved new drug said these

676
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,700
companies are misbranding the products

677
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,860
and issuing false claims to consumers

678
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,360
often these products do not even list

679
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,789
their ingredients on the product label

680
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,769
the FDA said consumers should beware

681
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,019
purchasing and using any such products

682
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:39,819
it is important to note that these

683
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,039
products are not a lot and not approved

684
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,960
by the FDA for the diagnosis cure

685
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,329
mitigation treatment or prevention of

686
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,039
any disease in late February the FDA

687
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,259
issued several warning letters to seven

688
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,200
companies that manufacture and market

689
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,849
hemp oils claiming to be rich in CBD by

690
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,830
promising cures for conditions such as

691
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,509
cancer autism and apps Apple apps

692
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:00,579
see none of which have been tested by

693
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:02,349
the FDA the companies who were issued

694
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:06,639
warning letters appeared to be violating

695
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:09,579
food and drug labeling laws in some

696
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,990
cases hold on throats going crazy here

697
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:12,849
I'm gonna take a drink this happens

698
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,870
occasionally we take a lot of dabs mug

699
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:18,369
it mug it sounds like I'm doing

700
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:21,459
something dirty he meant take a drink of

701
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:22,928
that delicious root beer it sounds like

702
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't know I just sounded gross

703
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,528
where am I I'm right here in some cases

704
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,259
the companies could not even smell

705
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:31,720
cannabidiol or inflammation correctly

706
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,308
the FDA notes this that's been on the

707
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,990
market for a while and it's always been

708
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:37,388
crap well one thing that I wanted to get

709
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,819
to is a lot of this stuff is brought in

710
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:41,740
from other countries because now that we

711
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,210
have got this market they're doing kind

712
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,038
of like what they did with spice you

713
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,139
know they see that this CBD stuff is

714
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,679
really popular and they're just sending

715
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:52,329
us crap it may be partially CBD so if

716
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,429
they can write that on the bottle but

717
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,720
then it's just other random oils just as

718
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,940
a filler so you don't even know what

719
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,159
you're giving these sick kids you have

720
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,330
to get I'll finish reading the article

721
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,159
and I'll try to remember where I am with

722
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,778
this rant the following companies and

723
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,909
products were among those notified by

724
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:09,148
the FDA then there are hyperlinks here

725
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:12,610
also you guys an illness a bunch of

726
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:15,278
companies cancer herb tea comma Florida

727
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:16,898
CBD life holdings of Arizona hemp oil

care of California pure CBD of

729
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:21,609
Washington it lists a bunch of them and

730
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,319
then it also says the FDA FDA also

731
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:25,209
conducted tests of some products sold by

732
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,308
these companies and found that in most

733
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,620
cases the products contained very little

734
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:31,509
cannabidiol or none at all

735
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,888
and there are some bullet points that

736
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,579
show some of the test findings I won't

737
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:35,859
read them all

738
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:38,319
it says the FDA tested two separate

739
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:42,069
samples of ultra CBD sold by CBD life

740
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:45,220
holdings offer it's one ounce bottle for

741
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:47,109
$45 on their website or on Amazon of the

742
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,630
samples tested one did not contain any

743
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:52,750
cannabinoids while the second contain

744
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,549
only point zero two percent CBD all the

745
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,308
products tested by the FDA that were

746
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:58,720
found to contain some CBD the ultra CBD

747
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:01,178
products contain to the smallest

748
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,130
percentage so you guys are paying for

749
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:05,409
stuff that doesn't even have any CBD in

750
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,759
it which is gonna make me wonder what is

751
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:09,429
in it

752
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,139
this is a big issue for a lot of usko

753
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,429
states that have passed Charlotte's Web

754
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:18,519
style AWS that allow for CBD only

755
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:20,440
products but they don't allow for you to

756
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,358
get them anywhere right essentially the

757
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,879
law requires you to come to Colorado or

758
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:26,348
another legal state buy something and

759
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:28,658
then break a bunch of federal laws on

760
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,729
your way home by taking it home yep and

761
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,469
then yeah if you're able to smuggle it

762
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:35,649
home you can go ahead and then legally

763
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:37,449
use it but that's mildly insane and so

764
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:42,218
when you're googling and you see hey

765
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:44,259
hemp oil CBD doesn't even say it's CBD

766
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:46,179
oil is what there's one package says if

767
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:47,429
you're lucky you're getting hemp seed

768
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,219
extract

769
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:53,440
if you're lucky tip if you're lucky just

770
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:55,929
know the bottom layer of whatever oil

771
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,328
some company in China makes and decided

772
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,499
to bottle up and label it as THC or CBD

773
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:02,138
oil right

774
00:26:59,499 --> 00:27:03,459
yep so the article keeps going I want to

775
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:05,769
finish this up just so we can finish the

776
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:08,169
whole article it says the warned CBD

777
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:10,388
companies have 15 days to follow the FDA

778
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,038
to show the FDA how they are complying

779
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:14,888
with the warning letters failure to

780
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,808
comply to failure to promptly correct

781
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:19,178
these violations may result in legal

782
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:21,190
action without further notice including

783
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:24,819
without limitation seizure and/or

784
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,349
injunction the FDA warns medical

785
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:28,388
marijuana experts suggest patients

786
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:30,939
considering CBD treatment to instead

787
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:32,348
seek CBD rich strains of cannabis grown

788
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,169
in states that allow medical marijuana

789
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:37,658
such as Colorado who also require

790
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:41,440
independent laboratory testing of all

791
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:44,409
marijuana products so medical experts

792
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,969
are even saying what Mike and I say go

793
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:51,249
to Colorado and get some lab tested

794
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:53,349
facility grown quality cannabis that's

795
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:54,489
safe that doesn't have any pesticides in

796
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:56,618
it because if it does it's been

797
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:59,169
quarantined and taken away like we're

798
00:27:56,618 --> 00:28:01,838
almost to where we need to be regulatory

799
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,099
wise here in Colorado they're going the

800
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:05,708
wrong direction with their new

801
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:07,989
regulations but where they need to be

802
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,909
adding stuff as in pesticide testing

803
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:11,739
those regulations aren't up to speed yet

804
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:14,259
because the testing labs aren't in place

805
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:16,808
yet because the FDA won't certify tests

806
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,338
like it just spirals right because of

807
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:19,749
our dumbass prohibition of this but

808
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,049
everybody that listens to the show knows

809
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:22,120
when I

810
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:26,230
gonna say the solution there is to

811
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,849
legalize it yes just do it already yeah

812
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,920
and then the FDA would already be

813
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,109
overseeing all this em seed extract [ __ ]

814
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,100
you'd be able to legally confidently buy

815
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:37,809
CBD oil that's legit CBD oil you'd know

816
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:40,779
what you were taking or giving your kid

817
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,099
or whatever yeah so this is partially

818
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:44,950
like to warm people if you're buying

819
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:48,129
this crappy CBD oil you're probably not

820
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,779
getting any help for your ailment hey if

821
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,820
you know if it's like what if what if

822
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,470
it's a placebo effect if it's working

823
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:54,730
and you felt better what do you what do

824
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,500
you think should they could do it in or

825
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,360
I don't know cuz maybe they're taking

826
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,309
some weird [ __ ] I'm not telling you to

827
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:03,339
take or not to take any that the truth

828
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,029
if something works it works for a reason

829
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:06,699
yeah

830
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:08,200
but who knows what you're taking guys so

831
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,210
the advice here is to come to Colorado

832
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,330
or legalize it where you are fight for

833
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,400
legalization and my guidance is when it

834
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:19,149
comes time to legalize in your area

835
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,660
don't pass CBD only legislation no pass

836
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,120
cannabis like recreational or medical

837
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,029
cannabis use to where you can consume

838
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,009
flower tor you can make extracts where

839
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,950
you can consume extracts and edibles

840
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:36,369
make it all part of that because just

841
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:39,430
the CBD is only going to work for a very

842
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:41,739
small portion of the medical cannabis

843
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:47,980
community CBD doesn't do a damn thing

844
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:50,349
for me like I need my THC for me right

845
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,809
right and I have a CBD episode coming up

846
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:53,859
on the future and guys I know I keep

847
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,210
saying that but I'm putting it together

848
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,949
there are some episodes I can throw

849
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,509
together and like a day or two the CBD

850
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,039
episode is going to take me quite a

851
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:01,779
while it's going to be a series I'm

852
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,089
gonna get several people to talk on it

853
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:05,440
and tell us how CBD treats them but Mike

854
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:11,980
is definitely gonna be one of the people

855
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,900
on there some good Brett I've got a lot

856
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,430
of notes on it already Doug is gonna be

857
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,780
part of that show Mike will be part of

858
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,330
that show we'll get a lot of people on

859
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:21,759
there I just met a few people recently

860
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:24,149
that are well-known in the CBD community

861
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,009
so that'll help us out

862
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,548
and we're finally starting to get CBD

863
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:31,169
CBD products real AB reliably in the rec

864
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:33,179
market I got all tongue-tied my mouth

865
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:35,400
notice that yet I was impressed we were

866
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,590
talking to the purchaser for the shop

867
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,000
and he was asking us what he asked us

868
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:40,709
for guidance we knows that were pot

869
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,329
heads he's like what should I buy guys

870
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,150
and he showed us an order that he was

871
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,439
able to get really high CBD products and

872
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,640
we encouraged him to do that for the

873
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,769
wreck shop so that we've got that

874
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,900
available for people as well yeah come

875
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:53,599
check it out you guys try some CBD see

876
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,980
what it does for you it may help you out

877
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,319
some people it's the miracle for me

878
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,110
there's nothing but so like I'm saying

879
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,000
don't go with the CBD only because CBD

880
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,769
only wouldn't do anything for me it's

881
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,538
the synergistic effect is what we're

882
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,460
searching for in my opinion we need a

883
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:10,740
little a little bit of THC to make it

884
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,558
all work I think it's all one one

885
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,909
unified thing that's my opinion so when

886
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,058
it comes time to legalize guys make sure

887
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,200
you don't just do CBD all right I need

888
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,700
to give a shout out to the author of

889
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,140
this article I like to remind you too it

890
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,538
was it was Thomas H Clarke from the

891
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,960
daily chronic you guys um be careful if

892
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,278
you're using m/l CBD products don't make

893
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,899
yourself sicker than you already are

894
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,269
know what you're using if you're buying

895
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:36,178
stuff from a shop and it doesn't have

896
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:38,339
lab testing start asking for it it's

897
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,778
it's just a matter of time until this is

898
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:41,428
just like everything else when you go to

899
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:43,079
a store and buy something you know what

900
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:46,440
you're buying you can look at the label

901
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,210
on it and know what's in it and be sure

902
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,390
that what's on the label is actually in

903
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:54,090
it because the FDA is testing this yes

904
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,370
yes well now we have the meed backing

905
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:58,500
you up will in Colorado the FDA is not

906
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:01,979
allowed to so we literally had to create

907
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,869
from the ground up our own meed they do

908
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,298
I mean that I remember when the first

909
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:08,308
testing labs were open the state didn't

910
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,259
give a [ __ ] that was the industry

911
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:12,599
demanding it patients were beginning to

912
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:14,879
demand it shops needed to know what they

913
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,069
were putting out and testing and back in

914
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,289
the day I was able to take my product my

915
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:21,538
finished flowers my hash to a shop and

916
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:24,390
have it tested there's discussions of

917
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,069
reopening labs to caregivers I hope so

918
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,110
because right now they've lost the rules

919
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,939
so tight well part of the thing is if

920
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:31,678
the shops have them so overwhelmed there

921
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,330
are so few labs that are qualified that

922
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,860
right now if I wanted to take my product

923
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,658
I'd probably have to wait a month anyway

924
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,359
so they just disallowed us to be able to

925
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,460
do it there

926
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,240
one type of testing and I honestly can't

927
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,920
remember what it is it's not potency but

928
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,259
I can't remember what that specialty

929
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,298
tests they we were hoping to get done

930
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,789
there's only one lab and it's in like 2

931
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:53,019
rango oh it's a residual solvent testers

932
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:55,359
yep you guys are looking for yeah it's

933
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:57,519
only for hash it's they can only do that

934
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,259
in Durango and so we're literally

935
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,700
discussing who we're gonna send it to

936
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:05,558
Rango like stuff through the mail to the

937
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,620
testing lab so one of us is gonna draw

938
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,928
the short straw it drive like 14 hours

939
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:14,259
across the state it's 14 hours

940
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:18,130
I'm ballparking okay I might need a day

941
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:20,349
off that'll be fun the opposite of fun I

942
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,450
think steep hill Halen can possibly do

943
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,069
those same tests but I'm not sure I can

944
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,779
don't quote me there yeah that was a

945
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,069
discussion I overheard a couple of

946
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,869
months ago yeah I heard part of that

947
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:30,750
today actually we're talking about labs

948
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:32,889
and such today and one of the offices

949
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,240

960
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,380
ah you guys follow the UFC a lot I'm not

961
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:58,058
a huge UFC follower

962
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,280
I followed Joe Rogan more than I follow

963
00:33:58,058 --> 00:34:01,928
the UFC but that's attached that's my

964
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,339
third degree of separation or whatever

965
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,630
you're gonna call it but there is

966
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,909
something that happened in the UFC that

967
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,050
as a pothead as a cannabis activists as

968
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,570
somebody who is part of the marijuana

969
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,480
community this got my attention there's

970
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,639
a UFC fighter who tested positive for

971
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,260
using cannabis who's been suspended for

972
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:22,750
five years five years doing his he's his

973
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,310
career has been put on hold is uh his

974
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,440
salary has been put on hold and they

975
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:29,108
also find him a hundred and fifty

976
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:33,340
thousand dollars for passing for failing

977
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:35,949
a pee test for cannabis I think that's

978
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,720
kind of silly I don't think saying yeah

979
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,949
this dude that's his job that's what

980
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,980
this guy training has trained his whole

981
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:44,888
life for you know now it's it's totally

982
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,389
and totally insane and there's a couple

983
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,550
of different reasons why it's insane

984
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,530
like

985
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,140
if it was steroids this would be a

986
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,970
little insane like five years is an

987
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,909
insanely long amount of time it's not a

988
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,769
performance-enhancing drug like it's

989
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,659
been shown to be helpful in protecting

990
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:03,239
against concussions and recovering from

991
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,009
head injury yes punched and kicked in

992
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,589
the face for a living it's his job yeah

993
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,830
yeah like there's a thousand different

994
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,690
reasons why this insane and I love uh

995
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,549
I'm gonna probably butcher her name so I

996
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,880
apologize because you can for sure kick

997
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,930
my ass but I think it's Ronda Rousey

998
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,269
independently went off during the press

999
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:23,309
conference and I saw that video oh yeah

1000
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,230
yeah I've only peripherally followed

1001
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:27,360
this story but she went off for

1002
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,699
basically the same reasons I did right

1003
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,320
to misquote want Ronda Rousey but to

1004
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,009
paraphrase and misquote her basically

1005
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,380
what she said was I if somebody uses

1006
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,180
steroids and they're entering fighting

1007
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,789
that potentially gives them the ability

1008
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:44,339
to hit me harder and kill me but if they

1009
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:46,170
are smoking cannabis that gives them the

1010
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,110
ability to heal themselves they're

1011
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,970
smoking a plant that was put here for us

1012
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,769
to smoke and we were going to punish

1013
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:54,419
people for it is basically what she said

1014
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:56,789
I'm gonna [ __ ] it all up I already told

1015
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,590
you that I totally agree with her Ronda

1016
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:01,050
Rousey is absolutely on the money with

1017
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,250
that yep there is a petition I'm not

1018
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,900
gonna beg you guys to sign the petition

1019
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,460
I haven't signed it yet but if you guys

1020
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,660
want if you're if you're in the UFC and

1021
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,280
you think it's wrong that this dude's

1022
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:11,279
been suspended that here's the thing

1023
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,760
they did give him three pee tests and

1024
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,710
two of them were clean and this third

1025
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,060
one was not even necessary it was by

1026
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,949
I've got a news article on the screen

1027
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,779
that I was gonna read but I didn't even

1028
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,919
want to get that far into this but it

1029
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,140
says ah

1030
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,539
Diaz submitted three urine samples on

1031
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,699
the night one prior to his fight and two

1032
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:30,960
and the hours afterward I'm really going

1033
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:32,429
quickly through this of those three

1034
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,320
samples the first and the third

1035
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:36,449
administered under the world anti-doping

1036
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,180
agency protocol and submitted for

1037
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:41,279
testing to the W ad a accredited sports

1038
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,079
medicine research and testing lab in

1039
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,610
Salt Lake City both of those came back

1040
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,549
clean so that's the world anti-doping

1041
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,769
agency you can't cheat that pee test I

1042
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,269
don't care how bad you are they see your

1043
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,039
wiener they see your dick when you're

1044
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:58,110
peeing they watch the pee come out of

1045
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,789
the head of your pee hole like it comes

1046
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,559
they watch it into the container and

1047
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:03,150
then they [ __ ] seal it themselves

1048
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,920
there were rubber gloves and catching it

1049
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,840
for you basically it's not the only

1050
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,210
reason I'm not an MMA fighter but it's

1051
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:14,340
on the [ __ ] list this is however the

1052
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,750
truth the 10:30 p.m. test however was

1053
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,309
administered by a separate testing

1054
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,489
representative and submitted to quest

1055
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:23,099
Diagnostics Anan W a DA accredited lab

1056
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,750
so that labs not even accredited that

1057
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,639
test came back over the threshold for

1058
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:30,090
allowable marijuana metabolites

1059
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,129
resulting in the lone positive test this

1060
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,200
company that tested him isn't even

1061
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,500
accredited by the world anti-doping

1062
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,599
agency and they did pass there but what

1063
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,940
the [ __ ] Las Vegas sporting whatever

1064
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,500
you're called the Nevada sporting and

1065
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,210
something Commission I'm not cool with

1066
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,190
you guys this sucks you guys need to go

1067
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,470
just sign the petition so that Nick Diaz

1068
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,900
can get back get his career back five

1069
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:54,480
years for a UFC fighter dude that would

1070
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,460
that's that's like half of your career

1071
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,010
bill you only get to go from your early

1072
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,420
20s until maybe 30 something unless

1073
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,730
you're a bad [ __ ] once you get

1074
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,380
them in 30s testosterone starts to drop

1075
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,329
in you can't take a punches is he gonna

1076
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,980
come back like Tyson after prison the

1077
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:10,049
[ __ ] knee blows out or something

1078
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,360
oh you mean talking Philly and chief at

1079
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:15,660
pigeons no like destroying people

1080
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,710
without annoying people it might be neat

1081
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:20,519
to see but I don't want to have to wait

1082
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,769
five years to see it fight for me this

1083
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,320
is just another example of why everyone

1084
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:27,900
needs to get involved and get educated

1085
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,850
like this guy doesn't get to fight for

1086
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,619
five years because he peed dirty other

1087
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,259
people are losing their kids because

1088
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,969
they peed dirty like other people are

1089
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,100
going to jail because they're selling

1090
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:39,719
people caught that people want because

1091
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,309
we want to smoke a plant while other

1092
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,889
people can drink some [ __ ] that makes

1093
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:46,170
them drive like maniacs and oh I can't

1094
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,730
blame it on alcohol but yeah because

1095
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,869
people want to smoke a plant we're going

1096
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,639
to jail we're not allowed to have the

1097
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,949
careers we want this dude can't fight

1098
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,420
this is terrible because we all hang

1099
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:58,349
back like we all get [ __ ] on regularly

1100
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,039

1101
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:04,949
Diaz support that you guys I do Mike

1109
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,829
head the positive thing is that we will

1110

1114
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:31,818

I don't not an argument a discussion

1116
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:36,528
with a stranger on Facebook about is

1117
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:38,440
holding your smoke a good idea he thinks

1118
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:40,998
you get hired from holding your smoke

1119
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,920
that was his statement and then we'll

1120
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:44,419
talk about other people's theories

1121
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,039
including mine if you'd like to be

1122
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,838

1127
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:56,838
hear my opinion on that so if somebody

1128
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,729
else would like to come and be on that I

1129
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,048

take a smoke off of a joint do you think

1136
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,068
it's a good idea to hold in your smoke

1137
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:15,259
for a few seconds how long do you think

1138
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:16,730
you should hold in your smoke do you

1139
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,880

1143
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:25,909

your smoke that's what's coming up on a

1162
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,079
future episode are you trying to think

1163
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,569
about more positive [ __ ] over there

1164
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,859
I'm also rattling through my brain about

1165
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:08,989
what I've read about holding in the

1166
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:10,548
smoke yeah

1167
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:12,980
there's multiple opinions on this topic

1168
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:15,768
yep yep yeah we'll save that one we'll

1169
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,389
get that out on another episode oh yeah

1170
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:19,068
let's wrap up the show man I'm trying to

1171
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:21,048
think of some positive [ __ ] we're here

1172
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:23,748
you're here okay here's some positive

1173
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:26,028
[ __ ] did you read that the CERN Large

1174
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:27,558
Hadron Collider was supposed to open up

1175
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:29,088
two black holes which is

1176
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,559
open a wormhole and the earth was gonna

1177
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,509
be swallowed and we're all gonna die

1178
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:36,229
that was supposed to happen on the 23rd

1179
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:39,079
and we're recording on the 24th so guess

1180
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:41,268
what we survived we didn't die so that's

1181
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:45,559
a positive note we're here Bruce Willis

1182
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:47,179
destroyed the meteor again y'all Bruce

1183
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,160
Willis gets to be the hero in this story

1184
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:53,719
I thought it'd be Arnold Schwarzenegger

1185
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:55,188
or something yeah Bruce Willis is just

1186
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,869
old and bald we'll give him the win on

1187
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:58,998
