00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,960
something I mentioned it's a holiday

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,430
season iTunes sent me an email and they

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,490
say that there will be a delay in

71
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,560
podcast posting between December 22nd

72
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,960
and January 5th which will affect this

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,449
episode and possibly another episode I

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,710
will post them early I'll try to get

75
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,389

76
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,010
show comes out on a Monday I'll try to

77
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,379
put it up like Saturday night and

78
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,179
hopefully that'll give iTunes time to do

79
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,409
whatever it is they're doing I'm not

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,980
sure why they choose to do that around

81
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:12,379
Christmas time I don't know what it's

82
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,810
gonna do guys we're gonna change the

83
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,909
name of the podcast eventually I said

84
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,310
December 1st but I was high I meant

85
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,380
January 1st we're gonna start calling it

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,290
the grow from your heart podcast because

87
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:27,110
I grow is actually a horticultural

88
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,090
agricultural educational institution

89
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,030
that does not want me associating their

90
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:33,109
name with our beloved sacred plant so

91
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,309
before they send me a cease and desist

92
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,189
letter I'm just gonna go ahead and

93
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,720
switch it up it's the responsible thing

94
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,920
to do that's kind I don't want to rip

95
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,420
off anybody else's name

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,970
you know if somebody else was called

97
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,500
agriculture I'd be pissed off about that

98
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,480
you know and or if they were called I

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,480
read genetics I'd be double pissed so I

100
00:04:51,339 --> 00:05:00,319
move closer to you but you've got that

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:02,180
beautiful that is sexy thank you I

102
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,469
didn't write down any space for you to

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,150
ramble about the emerald-cut but do you

104
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:12,720
want to tell us about your experience

105
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:14,789
for a second I'd highly recommend

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,400
all growers to try to make it out to

107
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,040
that one best cop I've ever seen nice

108
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,560
that's a huge thing to say yeah it's way

109
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,470
different it's not as tongue-in-cheek is

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,350
the cannabis cup there's it's not

111
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,030
stereotypical yeah so less of it less of

112
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,960

126
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,629
whole bug company company you guys are

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,269

know how many lights are going in there

129
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:40,560

130
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:44,600
okay I don't give exact units but it's

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,009
still single-digit units

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,169
sounds like you're a busy man yeah yeah

133
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,990
it was nothing there and the guy that

134
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:53,159
was there doing it was there all alone

135
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,340
and I mean I don't know if you've ever

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,630
tried to do construction alone but it's

137
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,310
hard you can't really do a lot of

138
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,459

batches I got to run some tubes myself

165
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,520
I've got all the way up to the point

166
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,680
when we put it in the back of it I

167
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,939
understand all of that and I understand

168
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,949
the back of and I just don't know the

169
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,540
controls on the oven very well myself

170
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,099
once I get that comfortable I think I

171
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,110
can make pretty good quality shatter

172
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,760
there's a batch of my shatter that I

173
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,310
blasted sitting in the back of and right

174
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,870
now waiting for me to check it out in

175
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:25,319
about 48 hours Spence is gonna flip it

176
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,970
because it's in his facility but we'll

177
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,409
go from seed to shatter it'll go all the

178
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,629
way from the germination all the way to

opinion on this it's not really cannabis

425
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:47,480
related but the Westboro Baptist Church

426
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:48,099

and it to local dispensaries they're

429
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,889

gay rights we have a a gay woman who is

431

465
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:34,000
watching duck dynasty watching porn gay

466

468
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:46,480
racial word coming out calling it home

469
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:48,699
it's back to the polo shirts and yes

470
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,990
mama but I truly am flattered there are

471
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,370
a lot of places for them to go and they

472
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,960
chose here because we have gay rights

473
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,709
and cannabis I just figured they'd run

474
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,350
it out there

475
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,909
places to go I don't want to be

476
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:59,949
offensive to a lot of people just just

477
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:01,659
the West I can't even say the name of

478
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,519
them they bother me so much just this

479
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,840

480
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,648
said a lot of rich I don't want to know

481
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,028

484
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,548
took a screenshot of the article here

485
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,860

486

498
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:43,869
states of Nebraska and Oklahoma have you

499
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,299
heard about this to join over there he

500
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,288
looks like he's ready for this story

501
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:48,519
today the states of Nebraska and

502
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,140
Oklahoma announced that they have filed

503
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,629
lawsuits against Colorado alleging that

504
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,919
Colorado's amendment 64 is

505
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,450
unconstitutional Colorado's Attorney

506
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,549
General John Suthers issued the

507
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,750
following statement in response because

508
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,429
neighboring states have expressed

509
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,528
concern about Colorado grown marijuana

510
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,970
coming into their states we are not

511
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,589
entirely surprised by this action

512
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,390
however it appears the plaintiffs

513
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:09,158
primary grievance stems from a non

514
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,320
enforcement of federal laws regarding

515
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,870
marijuana as opposed to choices made by

516
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,759
the others of Colorado we believe this

517
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:18,038
suit is without merit and we will

518
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,210
vigorously defend it against it in the

519
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,960
US Supreme Court

520
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,759
so Nebraska and Oklahoma are trying to

521
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,679
sue Colorado because we are not

522
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,658
following federal rule they're gonna try

523
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,250
to force the feds to come in here and

524
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,919
clean up the weeds seem that we've

525
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,829
created they're Giglio that money you

526
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:43,630
think they're jelly no but those aren't

527
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:45,038
states that pretty much lock you up

528
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,940
forever for having herb they don't like

529
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,859
it at all there I know it's happening

530
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,149
because I know people we read about him

531
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:55,028
getting busted all the time people are

532
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:56,528
definitely driving pounds pounds and

533
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:58,569
pounds out of this state because we're

534
00:21:56,528 --> 00:22:01,269
able to produce it do you really think

535
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:05,109
it was any more than before yes

536
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:08,289
um there there is more cannabis smaller

537
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:10,240
amount yes and more personal were you

538
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,799
here for the wild wild west revolution

539
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,599
that I talked about when everybody got a

540
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:22,480
red card there was nobody to care to

541
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:23,919
regulate it just glue and you could grow

542
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,299
I could walk into your shop at the

543
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,960
backpack full of quarter pounds and

544
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:31,299
selling me yeah so imagine if you were

545
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,980
getting here it was seven to eight maybe

546
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:35,169
nine if you could really hustle the shop

547
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,690
for a quarter pound but I know friends

548
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,120
that will maybe send [ __ ] to the East

549
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,309
Coast and they can get 15 for that same

550
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,659
quarter pound to their cousin that lived

551
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:45,460
or their brother that lives out there

552
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,990
and they just don't give a [ __ ] they're

553
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,809
like why not and they'll just send it or

554
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,769
drive it out there what's - if you're a

555
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:59,980
20-something year old kid with no kids

556
00:22:52,769 --> 00:23:01,509
the weeds I feel like the weeds just

557
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,460
gonna be moving across those states

558
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:05,740
anyways regardless of whether they sue

559
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,490
us it'll just go right back to wherever

560
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,870
they be the solution would just be

561
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,420
nationwide legalization you know

562
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,009
medicine without borders we just start a

563
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,630
new a new program medicine without

564
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:25,000
borders you just make it known and we'll

573

583

587
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:37,210
got an article my oh look it's

595
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,269
Kyle Potter of The Associated Press and

596
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:12,069

00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:21,879
worried about the federal government

602
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,950
cracking down on the state to mental

603

medical marijuana program I'm gonna kind

604
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,319
of skim a little bit here because I want

605
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,540
to get to more of this stuff I just

606
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,269
wanted to read this one in its current

607
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:32,859
form the 1.1 trillion dollar spending

608
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,929
bill includes a section that bans the

609
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,548
Department of Justice from using federal

610
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,548
funds to intervene with states with

611
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:40,839
medical marijuana laws that's the best

612
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:42,429
part right there I can almost stop the

613
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,349
whole article right there so what that

614
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:47,019
says is I'm gonna read it again in its

615
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:48,819
current form the 1.1 trillion dollar

616
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:50,109
spending bill the rep your money name

617
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:52,178
wrap your head around that [ __ ]

618
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:54,668
number real quick 1.1 trillion dollars

619
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,919
but then it says bans the Department of

620
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,360
Justice from using federal funds to

621
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,880
intervene in states with medical

622
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,069
marijuana laws which means they can't

623
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,840
[ __ ] with us now I mean they can cuz

624
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,159
they'll find a way yeah but they're not

625
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,720
gonna mess with the states they're not

626
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,250
gonna try to come and make us which are

627
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,539
laws back they're not gonna I don't

628
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,669
think they're gonna continue with raids

629
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,869
they're still gonna be illegal grow-ops

630
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:16,750
they're still gonna be illegal stuff

631
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:19,429
going on that they're gonna have to

632
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,930
this is 23 states have legalized medical

633
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,330
marijuana but those measures still

634
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,890
conflict with federal law and though the

635
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,210
Obama administration has generally been

636
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,520
friendlier to marijuana than

637
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,829
administration's past Monson regala

638
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,139
wondered what if that changes or a new

639
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:35,839
president changes court changes course

640
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,460
the US House narrowly passed the funding

641
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,500
bill with the medical marijuana section

642
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,430
Thursday at this Senate was expected to

643
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,380
take it up Friday so he doubts the bill

644
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,660
will markedly change the government's

645
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,370
handling of the issue most attorneys

646
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,990
have indicated they won't go after

647
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,519
medical marijuana businesses so as there

648
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,410
as long as they're following state laws

649
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,700
so the point is I think it gives them a

650
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,710
little more comfort and I wouldn't say

651
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,180
it gives very much more comfort but you

652
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,860
never know he continued the bottom line

653
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,140
is it's still illegal under federal law

654
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,939
so anything could happen but they don't

655
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,920
have funding so what are they gonna do

656
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:12,170
these cops are gonna go and raid [ __ ] on

657
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,670
their own time are they but I mean then

658
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,740
you're also if the cops gonna go off and

659
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,650
do that on his own time without support

660
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,269
he may be looking for that lucrative

661
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:24,200
income yeah that's not gonna fly in

662
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:26,059
Colorado it sounds like to me it's gonna

663
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,100
lead to back to cops all right so we've

664
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:30,619
done like 25 minutes let's get into some

665
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:31,909
talk about this organics stuff I want to

666
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,619
make sure that I got through all the

667
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,070
important part paid all the bills yeah

668
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:39,469
I'm good I'm caught up I'm paying almost

669
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:41,240
a real show you wouldn't even believe it

670
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,309
episode 50 is coming up and I'm getting

671
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,349
excited starting to think about what we

672
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:46,700
can give away hey Jesse if you're

673
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,839
listening do remember you guys kind of

674
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,309
volunteered to give some [ __ ] away on

675
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,259
number 50 we got to talk about that so

676
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:56,659
we've been kind of like trying to figure

677
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:58,819
out what to give away nice

678
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,180
so he's been bouncing things off me and

679
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:03,649
I've been bouncing things off him and he

680
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,240
let us know what you want if you guys

681
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,009
wasn't in tweet me at high grow culture

682
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,809
or you email me I grow culture at

683
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:10,220
hotmail.com let us know what you want

684
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,250
for giveaway prizes and we'll see if we

685
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,180
can't accommodate you so Sean's here the

686
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,549
guy that talked to a whole bunch about

687
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,720
cool organic [ __ ] King Cola you guys

688
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:19,490
love that show

689
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,170
drying and curing and that organics

690
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,529
episode have been my two most popular

691
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:26,529
episodes out of 44 episodes

692
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:28,059
yes people learned a lot of people asked

693
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,299
a lot of questions I can't shout out

694
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,710
everybody that he mailed me texted me

695
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:34,029
tweeted me because I would spend the

696
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,890
whole show doing it but we got a lot of

697
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,509
response on that I want to talk more

698
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,650
about worm castings mostly because

699
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,269
that's kind of what seemed to be the

700
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,850
base of a lot of your stuff and a lot of

701
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:44,319
what got the conversation going I'm

702
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:47,619
gonna jump back we were talking about

703
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,329
worm castings we've got four basic - you

704
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:51,309
said worm castings in molasses

705
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:53,199
and you mentioned multiplying the

706
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,500
protozoa is something that you really

707
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,730
stressed so first of all I guess my main

708
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:05,200
question I should ask is what are

709
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:08,140
protozoa in Despres it's not just the

710
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:15,430
protozoa it's everything it's all of the

711
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:16,930
microbes and fungi so you're just gonna

712
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,420
give them a food source and really give

713
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,070
them a chance to thrive and grow so all

714
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,289
of those things actually fall under the

715
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:29,200
category of protozoa know the protozoa

716
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:30,940
are a specific I can't think the term

717
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,610
right off of my head but yeah it's just

718
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,170
a certain microbe I'd seen the word but

719
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:41,469
I never paid attention until you open my

720
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:45,100
mind to it actually so since we're on

721
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,910
the subject we have been feeding our

722
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:48,519
worms

723
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:51,970
we've been substituting alfalfa with

724
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,490
cannabis yeah we were donated a little

725
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,680
over 3000 pounds of what we call canna

726
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:00,819
meal which is finely ground material

727
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,440
from a local actually I can open vape

728
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:05,409
are you familiar with the company they

729
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,920
sell vapor pins and Organa labs they

730
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:11,140
donated the material by law by state law

731
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,019
all dispensaries have to dispose of

732
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,759
their waste and unfortunately a lot of

733
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,829
people are just mixing it with old dirt

734
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,950
and throwing it in a dumpster it's going

735
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:24,189
to a landfill we've been feeding it to

736
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:27,730
our worms kind of as a test trial worms

737
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,080
loved it they really did we just are we

738
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,419
just

739
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:35,460
our test results back today actually and

740
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:40,710
the it was off the chart I mean it

741
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,640
really was see what we had a second bear

742
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,308
with him he's digging through the hi

743
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,169
phone always takes a minute I mean the

744
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:47,490
Rocky Mountain one company has

745
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,440
definitely been the conversation work

746
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,038
for those most of the week anyways

747
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,380
that's good he really takes pride in

748
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:57,898
what he does and he feeds his worms the

749
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,340
highest quality everything and then it

750
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:03,379
seems to be the important part it really

751
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:06,028
is you know he he he makes them produce

752
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,559
what you want yeah everybody's so

753
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:09,690
focused on cost

754
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,190
everybody wants the cheapest casting out

755
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,350
there and they don't really understand

756
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,730
that you're only hurting yourself yeah

757
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,648
if you want like keep saying if you're

758
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,450
gonna cut costs on the grow then cut the

759
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:19,918
cost of the sale too and they don't want

760
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,819
to do that they want to cut cost and one

761
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,970
in it's not fair and with these castings

762
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:29,638
you can take your compost and cut you

763
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,350
know ten to 15% of the compost and then

764
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:34,888
make your own vermicompost and then cut

765
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:37,168
that in one part peat moss one part

766
00:31:34,888 --> 00:31:38,959
aeration one part vermicompost there's

767
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:41,159
your base oil you can add in your

768
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,740
amendments like your crab meal and your

769
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,289
azomite cope and I'll file for whatever

770
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,649
you're gonna add you know there's your

771
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:53,308
mix oil and it's really that simple but

772
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:55,739
Jays been feeding his worms cannabis

773
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:59,388
plant matter and they have been freaking

774
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:02,730
loving it test results were astronomical

775
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:05,939
compared ibly to running the alfalfa the

776
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,259
biological life was off the chart I mean

777
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,759
we

778
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:15,960
gained hundreds of protozoa fungi

779
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,960
bacteria the act of fungi which means

780
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,480
basically the things that are working in

781
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,909
the soil before we had a higher fungal

782
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,769
content but that doesn't really mean

783
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:28,220
much if they're not active we have a

784
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:30,480
lower fungal content but more activity

785
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,490
so you want more bio life yeah this

786
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,380
stuff is so freakin bio diverse it's

787
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,210
amazing I'm so excited about it

788
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,250
so feeding a cannabis made it better

789
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:45,090
you're gonna feed that to your cannabis

790
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:47,369
those leaves back to those worms self

791
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:49,589
sustainable system and we all got to get

792
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,939
away from the bottles I've been reading

793
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:52,798
more about us and Sean kind of talked

794
00:32:50,940 --> 00:33:10,769
about it and we're paying for shipping

795
00:32:52,798 --> 00:33:12,778
and water there's just so much preserve

796
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,538
it they gotta make it stable and it's

797
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:16,798
got to be elated or buffer or yeah then

798
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:18,119
it's gotta be shipped and it's gotta be

799
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,829
able to stay in different temperatures

800
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,449
and it's gonna have a shelf life you

801
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:24,538
could just make it yourself 24 hours

802
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,269
before you yeah you can smell it it's so

803
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,919
much richer yes you're not throwing away

804
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:30,960
plastic for all the neighbors to see

805
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,750
your freaking botanic air bottles in the

806
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,360
trash can they don't need that so you

807
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,369
talked about multiplying the protozoa

808
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,178
what's the best way to go about that

809
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:42,148
basically you just need to give them a

810
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,700
food source so when you when you give

811
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:45,839
like make sure T up so you basically

812
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,278
what you're gonna do is you're gonna add

813
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,079
in your worm castings and then you're

814
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,669
gonna put in your food source and that's

815
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:52,379
amazing I'm gonna back up just first

816
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:54,000
time using a five-gallon bucket yeah so

817
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,620
a five-gallon bucket like a nylon or

818
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:12,690
something to keep all the stuff in I

819
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:15,929
preach free suspension teas bucket get

820
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,639
your hopefully reverse osmosis water or

821
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,960
at least doc let it bubble for a couple

822
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,210
of days get the air out

823
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,309
and then put all your your worm castings

824
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,809
your molasses and whatever else you

825
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:26,369
decide to put in there exactly can you

826
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,960
can expand on it as you please you

827
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,710
talked about a lot of cool [ __ ] to put

828
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,329
in there hope you're paying attention

829
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,730
yeah basically yes so you get your

830
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:34,050
bucket you get your hair stones castings

831
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,699
and molasses you're gonna throw that in

832
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,579
there and you're gonna just want to brew

833
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,199
it from 12 to 24 hours I really wouldn't

834
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,700
recommend taking it anything over that

835
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,710
if you're not familiar with brewing

836
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,299
something you guys it's gonna bubble up

837
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,300
and hopefully it's gonna bubble up huge

838
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:58,818
[Music]

839
00:34:51,230 --> 00:35:02,670
nice I've seen some of your pictures

840
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:04,019
yeah all right so we just want to up

841
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,309
feed them and put them in a bucket and

842
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,119
give them some oxygen and they will

843
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,890
multiply

844
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,539
do you know the ratio they multiply are

845
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:13,588
we gonna give them like 10,000 times or

846
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:14,308
a thousand times more it's pretty

847
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:16,170
amazing

848
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,510
check out anybody who's listening that's

849
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:22,170
interested in this google microbe man

850
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,990
and he's got amazing articles about brew

851
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,568
times and how you can you know take them

852
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:29,519
longer for more fungal dominated or

853
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:35,519
times more bacterial domina teas how you

854
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:37,259
can actually kind of cook your letter

855
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,519
inoculate your ingredients for your

856
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,980
compost tea to make a more fungal

857
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,449
dominant so you can take your earthworm

858
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,338
castings and sprinkle in a little bit of

859
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:47,279
oatmeal like so let's say that you're

860
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,960
gonna use three cups so I mean for

861
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,460
example I mixed a fifteen gallon tear

862
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,470
there I used 3 and 3/4 cups of worm

863
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,970
castings right and I knew I was gonna

864
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,798
use that much so what I did is I took

865
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:01,588
that 3 and 3/4 cup of where I'm castings

866
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:04,230
and put it in a mason jar added some oat

867
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:06,808
bran spray it with a water bottle and

868
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,519
sealed it up about two days ago and then

869
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:10,589
today I went down into my basement and

870
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,509
cracked it open and it smells sweet it

871
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:15,449
was covered in white goodness you know

872
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,359
bacteria and I use that for my tea and

873
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:20,669
that's a weighted fungal charge the [ __ ]

874
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,619
yeah it sounds like wow that's pretty

875
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,880
sweet and cannabis plants love fungal

876
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,858
dominance and so that's gonna make

877
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,510
instead of those little scraggly shooty

878
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:30,338
roots you see it's gonna make big thick

879
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,739
white spaghetti for roots right exact

880
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:34,478
you know with the when you do the free

881
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:36,909
suspension teas and you kinda get

882
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:38,259
Messier your drip trays will fill up

883
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:41,190
with dirt you know how it get to the

884
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:43,900
engine and I've seen my roots will grow

885
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,900
right into that dirt bottom of the pot

886
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,059
and they just can't get enough of it I'm

887
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,829
definitely I need to go so the stores in

888
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:52,239
Colorado Springs I live about 45 minutes

889
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:54,430
away from there I'm going to plan a trip

890
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,599
up there quite soon I hear within the

891
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,909
next week I've got some freshly

892
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,028
transplanted stuff that I want to feed

893
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:02,828
some Rocky Mountain worm tea you keep

894
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:04,568
talking about has a bite do I want I've

895
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,640
always thought of as my is something I

896
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:19,900
wanted to add flour do I want that in my

897
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:22,748
face as well recommend until your

898
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:26,289
flowering especially if you're you know

899
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:26,588
not transplanting really yeah okay all

900
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:29,109
right

901
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:30,818
yeah these plants I'm doing a little pop

902
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:33,518
yeah Haysom I know a lot of people who

903
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:35,409
will do uh worm castings grow Kashi and

904
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:41,379
he's in my every two weeks as a top

905
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:43,149
dress everybody's all grow Kashi is

906
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,950
really cool but I feel like a lot of

907
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,210
people are using it just to use it I

908
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:48,518
don't know if they really understand

909
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,949
what they're using it for the idea is

910
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:54,758
that it's lactic acid bacteria it's

911
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:57,098
photosynthetic bacteria

912
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:59,228
it's yeast it's a lot of other things

913
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:01,749
going on in there and you're gonna

914
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:04,659
introduce that into your root zone into

915
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:09,568
your plant and the grow cashew actually

916
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:09,568
help digest old roots

917
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,019
[Music]

918
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:23,170
see there's something else I'm gonna

919
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,429
learn it's gonna take me a little bit of

920
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,469
time but eventually I'm gonna get away

921
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,389
from all the bottled nutrients it's a

922
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:30,249
little overwhelming because I taught him

923
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,509
how to grow mostly with full bottled

924
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:33,068
stuff and he's over there shaking his

925
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:36,818
head like I have to really I saw the

926
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:38,409
seed process and I just clicked I

927
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:39,969
compared it to like cooking you know

928
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:41,000
like when you when you first start

929
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,769
cooking and you look

930
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,789
recipes online and stuff they're

931
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:48,949
freaking overwhelming beginners many

932
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:51,019
things that go into it but once you

933
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:53,839
acquire once you know your cabinets

934
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:55,969
filled with all this Rises it's nothing

935
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,680
it takes five minutes to you know whip

936
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:59,089
up a meal and it's the same thing with

937
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,940
the tea is it's overwhelming at first

938
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:05,120
but once you have castings and molasses

939
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:07,070
and kelp and Hydra sleep everything that

940
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,449
you use it's really nothing and then

941
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,250
you're buying all these things in bulk

942
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:12,859
so you're getting a mid a fraction of

943
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,719
the cost without water weight for

944
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,599
shipping - yeah yeah well you can buy

945
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:24,259
everything locally for between Jesse and

946
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:30,769
then there's there's absolutely what's a

947
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,090
good time for me to drop it like that's

948
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,449
about my style Monday through Friday

949
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,450
midday

00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,400
I'll be up there really soon I'll go get

952
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,260
some stuff oh man he spurts so many

953
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,420
questions so many questions I'm not sure

954
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,890
which one to pick I have I'll choose one

955
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,960
from a listener I gotta grab my phone

956
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:59,000
again I feel like I'm the wrong person

957
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,650
in this damn chair I feel like if Jesse

958
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,239
was here right now he would have been

959
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,650
all in this conversation and I'm just

960
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:09,079
sitting over here like with my mouth

961
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:11,180
open so that's great I'm love hearing

962
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,090
about this because I see it around in

963
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:16,639
all the the growing footage and [ __ ]

964
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,200
part of my show is to bring the growers

965
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,509
on your level and the growers on his

966
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,089
level to get one together because we're

967
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,950
not different I started first you were a

968
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,170
plan guitar or being a skateboarder or

969
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:27,529
you probably play xbox way better than

00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,809
me

971
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,010
you might MMA fight as growing while

972
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:32,539
you're doing that I'll help you grow

973
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,370
some weed hopefully what I want to learn

how to MMA fight or some [ __ ] you're

975
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:37,699
down to teach me I live back east there

976
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,110
was nobody that was willing to teach you

977
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:41,939
and you know it's

978
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,300
I watched all the YouTube videos for

979
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,490
many many years so now being able to see

980
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,400
it firsthand and being able to have

981
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:55,489
different styles when I trim the first

982
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:59,400
time I thought you had a boner it's like

983
00:40:55,489 --> 00:41:00,949
it got really weird yeah yeah when I

984
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,380
gave him that grateful dog he went nuts

985
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:05,730
it was so good wow what happened oh I

986
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,110
know what's happening I hope that

987
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,990
doesn't really affect the podcast here

988
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:11,789
phone call and it's popping up on my

989
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:14,059
computer because the new iOS know it's

990
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:16,320
working the new iOS 8 likes to do that

991
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:17,549
but anyway let's get back on track you

992
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,050
know did I like having you on because

993
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,910
you don't have to be a pro to be here

994
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,740
you you might ask the one question that

995
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:24,329
the listeners are wondering because

996
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,279
we're Sean and I kind of know what we're

997
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:27,449
saying and we just we get I've been told

998
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,610
that we're snobs don't we just talk

999
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:32,609
right over some points because we expect

1000
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,519
everyone to know that wears off really

1001
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:37,470
well to like it's it's just I go home

1002
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,909
and show how like oh this so someone so

1003
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:40,739
gave us some bud and I'm like I don't I

1004
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:42,690
don't want that yeah I'm good now that

1005
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,069
you've seen some things yeah we've kind

1006
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,659
of opened Adam sighs but Adam first

1007
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:49,860
moved here he would have smoked anything

1008
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:51,210
I have smoked anything yeah you know

1009
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,890
that guy that cleans out your ashtray

1010
00:41:51,210 --> 00:42:00,150
yeah and smokes the stuff out of your

1011
00:41:52,889 --> 00:42:01,980
ashtray yep so we got a actually there's

1012
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,380
a facebook comment from our good buddy

1013
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,000
Fred Fred Garvin Fred likes to comment

1014
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,340
and I appreciate it dude so this one

1015
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,409
says haha shout out Jeff hey episode 44

1016
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,420
was rockin dude I caught that tease

1017
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:13,859
about the next episode and map and death

1018
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,360
I'm really interested in that I know

1019
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,730
nothing about it except Cushman

1020
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,680
yammering on about it being bad on a

1021
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,929
couple other podcasts but that's it I

1022
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,899
would like to know what it is is it bad

1023
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:27,299
is it in my canna a and B cocoa and if

1024
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,700
it is bad what synthetic new line should

1025
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,350
I should i / we be looking at anyway

1026
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:34,349
keep the shows come in and stay frosty

1027
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,969
bro and thanks for what you do so first

1028
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:38,119
of all I say dude thanks for freaking

1029
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:40,139
sending us messages participating and

1030
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,369
thanking us for what we do like I said

1031
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,569
earlier that means a lot you catch that

1032
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,739
something with digital on me that's cool

1033
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,180
it's back though yeah thanks for the

1034
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:50,209
question and so that's a question for

1035
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,159
Shawn you were talking about mapping

1036
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,608
I've been dap is see if I can say this

1037
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,858
right it's mono ammonium phosphate in

1038
00:42:54,608 --> 00:43:00,019
diode potassium phosphate or something

1039
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:05,900
similar to that I'll give it to you yeah

1040
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:09,530
but basically they're they're chemicals

1041
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,750
that are used in basically every single

1042
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,790
high I drove product or synthetic

1043
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:19,849
nutrient product on the shelf

1044
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:22,550
they're synthetic salts the big problem

1045
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:24,680
with them in my opinion is they don't

1046
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,480
flush out of plants I have you know I

1047
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,909
don't think that you can get them out

1048
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,280
heavy metals and things like that are

1049
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:33,980
stored in the tricone so once you kind

1050
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,330
of get them in there there's no way to

1051
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,550
get them out and if you're blasting

1052
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:43,460
you're blasting those heavy metals into

1053
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:45,109
your mix a couple of times - one of the

1054
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,358
things that's filled with heavy metals

1055
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:49,358
so you really want to be live you don't

1056
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,409
want to use too much of that stuff

1057
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,980
glacial rock dust filled with heavy

1058
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:56,629
metals so it's not just our synthetics

1059
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,108
you know that are filled with these

1060
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:03,079
things but mono map and dap are probably

1061
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:04,848
the worst of all just in the simple fact

1062
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,980
that they're the most common and it's

1063
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:08,450
easy it's something easy to look out for

1064
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,480
and I'm not telling you they're like a

1065
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:13,848
runaway from the map and dad but it's if

1066
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,858
you're somebody who's interested in a

1067
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:19,160
cleaner product something that's a

1068
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:20,960
little bit more organic you know you

1069
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,940
need to become familiar with the terms

1070
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,099
that you need to look out for and those

1071
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,139
are some of them if you're looking for a

1072
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:30,800
nice organic product looked for

1073
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:33,650
something with like soybean meal or kelp

1074
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,599
or alfalfa Brewers Easter whole

1075
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,680
synthetic offer stuff like yeah so

1076
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,690
synthetics is a killer so good

1077
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,149
especially if he's ranked Anna I mean if

1078
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,760
you're in Canada then your bio biz is an

1079
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,240
organic nutrient line that's very

1080
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:54,200
similar style of growing really high

1081
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,149
quality stuff or grain on Instagram yeah

1082
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:59,539
everybody probably follows that guy he

1083
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,769
straight crushes it all by a biz

1084
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:05,840
I don't know if you really talked to

1085
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:16,820
that way he uses because he's got

1086
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:20,450
amazing good progress this is a really

1087
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,280
good one to use general organics that's

1088
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:27,219
you know that's another one to use

1089
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:50,780
that's really good but I don't use

1090
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:52,519
things like that so it's just printed on

1091
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,500
the bottle as mono ammonium phosphate

1092
00:45:52,519 --> 00:46:00,380
yes okay so if you're looking for it

1093
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:02,269
that's map and DAP is the dye oh trying

1094
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,769
to avoid that that those are the Tula to

1095
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:08,360
stray from and I know I'm just parroting

1096
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:09,619
what Cushman says but Cushman says if

1097
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,030
that's often what it gives you when you

1098
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:12,139
smoke good weed and for some reason you

1099
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,640
get a headache and you're like that was

1100
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:16,159
good herb why did it give me a headache

1101
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:18,500
it had map and app residuals in it I

1102
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,179
can't prove that but that's what Cushman

1103
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,820
has led me to believe from everything he

1104
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:24,409
said and I mostly trust Cushman there's

1105
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:30,620
no reason not to trust Cushman in my

1106
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:34,789
opinion names with this began as one a

1107
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:36,409
couple of cups he really knows what the

1108
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:40,809
plant wants yeah I'll take his word for

1109
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:44,569
it yeah do you recycle your soil yes

1110
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:50,570
yeah I don't like to recycle okay I

1111
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:53,890
really don't I really don't if I recycle

1112
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:57,100
my so I like my veggie garden

1113
00:46:53,889 --> 00:47:00,299
I just haven't mastered that yet okay um

1114
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:02,619
I always see a loss in yield no matter

1115
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,539
I've blamed it on other things and

1116
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,789
haven't attributed it to that I always

1117
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:10,860
these worm castings are gonna help me uh

1118
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:13,779
problem I'm having better luck

1119
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,789
starting with sterile media's I used to

1120
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,460
run like happy frog and roots and stuff

1121
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:21,969
like that switched it up to more of like

1122
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,650
a premix base got a lot better results

1123
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:26,169
out of that now I'm running my own like

1124
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,470
vermicompost peat moss and buckwheat

1125
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:31,690
hole with amendments and stuff but the

1126
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:34,029
pro mix and stuff I'm getting better

1127
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,769
results with reusing the soil it's a lot

1128
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,140
easier to amend it at the beginning of

1129
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:40,929
being a sterile media okay I can write

1130
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:42,909
down how much of what I put into it and

1131
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:45,099
basically if my plant doesn't show a

1132
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:48,789
deficiency throughout that cycle I just

1133
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:51,489
remand everything like I would you know

1134
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:54,369
brand new soil mix and grow right back

1135
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:56,139
into it where is running the Fox farm

1136
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:59,319
and the roots organic I feel like with

1137
00:47:56,139 --> 00:48:01,210
the guano's and the blood meals and

1138
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,660
everything that's already in there plus

1139
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,860
me amending it by the end of the cycle

1140
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:08,109
sure the Marten I have been having any

1141
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,900
deficiencies but I really don't know

1142
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:13,900
once it's oils yeah yeah okay that's

1143
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,510
kind of where I'm at with reusing soil

1144
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,820
[Music]

1145
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,260
using mixes so this is kind of what I

1146
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,630
found to do what I've been doing with my

1147
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,750
soil lately so I take it and mix it with

1148
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:27,180
this stuff out of my boo Kashi bucket

1149
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:29,219
like all of the slimy leftover pickle

1150
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:31,500
trash that ends up in your book Hoshi

1151
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:32,909
bucket so I just mix it in with my soil

1152
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,090
and it looks like you're making him

1153
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,089
hungry

1154
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,909
you just dump it out into your you know

1155
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,860
into like a Rubbermaid container fill it

1156
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:46,799
up with dirt and then just let it sit

1157
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,660
and then basically you know in a couple

1158
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,950
of weeks or a month or two or whenever I

1159
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,659
get around to going back to those

1160
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:53,279
buckets

1161
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:55,920
it'll be compost and then I'll mix that

1162
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,250
with worm castings use that as a

1163
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:10,019
vermicompost for my soil so I use it up

1164
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:17,760
a lot of space aren't you storing

1165
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:21,179
everything any weird experience just

1166
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,340
email Jeff yeah there we go and I also

1167
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:25,769
have a friend in California who Walter

1168
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,180
bugs yeah yeah if you've got a plant

1169
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:29,099
with bugs he wants you to clip off the

1170
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,299
leaf of that or a branch of that plant

1171
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,710
and send it to him so that he can play

1172
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,570
with the bugs that's his specialty

1173
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,650
that's cool yeah a treat John what's up

1174
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:49,620
bro hope you're listening tree town

1175
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:53,039
farmer people are hardcore I'm gonna

1176
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:54,750
find ya yeah that's the truth Adams a

1177
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,250
good little transplant and grunt worker

1178
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,829
he does some [ __ ] in the gardens just

1179
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,480
worked I walked in the room and him and

1180
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,650
this other dude had dirt flying three

1181
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,909
feet in the air and all of it was

1182
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:07,680
landing in two pots I don't know how I

1183
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:09,210
was working that's right no you

1184
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:15,029
definitely work at a different pace than

1185
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:16,139
what my what should I not use it buy

1186
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,320
organic so it's gonna be my last

1187
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:24,000
question for the day yeah it depends on

1188
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:26,370
your level but the first thing that I

1189
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,059
would kick out would be blood meal above

1190
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:29,949
meal okay

1191
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:33,430
if you really care about organics

1192
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:35,259
chances are you don't eat GMOs and you

1193
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:37,058
don't eat I'm not gonna say you're

1194
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:40,028
vegetarian if you're you know if you're

1195
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:42,249
into organics and stuff but those things

1196
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:44,139
are byproducts of like the you know

1197
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:47,278
slaughterhouse mystery feather meals a

1198
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:49,808
byproduct of the poultry industry and

1199
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:52,139
they have their place don't get me wrong

1200
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:54,670
because I'd rather than be recycled into

1201
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:56,618
agricultural byproducts for farm and

1202
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,568
other agricultural uses but when it

1203
00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:00,910
comes to growing medicine for people I

1204
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:02,558
don't believe that feather meal made

1205
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:05,170
from chickens that were fed you know

1206
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,880
antibiotics and hormones should be used

1207
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,650
to grow a same thing with the blood that

1208
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,028
scraped out the slaughterhouse floor to

1209
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,880
make the blood meal it's just this

1210
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:16,420
gelatinous goo filled with everything

1211
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,249
that there was in that cow so if you're

1212
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,409
gonna use things like that I would just

1213
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:23,468
recommend there's other alternatives

1214
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:25,538
like fish blood meal alfalfa kelp

1215
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:27,278
I mean there's a lot of plant baits if

1216
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:32,079
you really want to get into it comfrey

1217
00:51:27,278 --> 00:51:34,778
and burdock root nettle and the woods

1218
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,339
pick a bunch of sheets am I gonna come

1219
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:38,259

1220
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:40,119
company with a whole backseat full of

1221
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:41,858
brand-new [ __ ] and rethink my whole

1222
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,479
growing mint the first time I go in here

1223
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:45,038
probably will and the cool thing is

1224
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:54,578
you're gonna you'll probably see a

1225
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:56,259
couple of things that you've seen if

1226
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:59,410

1228
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:17,889
that I use in my garden but I use it to

1229
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,989
basically replace my full power bar if

1230

1267
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,890
Mantes so great the best idea we had

1268
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,059
that was buying bags to bring it home

1269
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,859
and make it so now we don't have to

1270
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,150
drive to our favorite MOT a spot in

1271
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,950
Colorado Smyrna and Manitou Springs

1272
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:34,740
every time we want latte because we

1273
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:36,719
would do so I hate to say it I'm more

1274
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:42,959
comfortable in Manitou Springs than I am

1275
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:46,529
here in Pueblo but I feel like I have

1276
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,269
more friends that are more open to go

1277
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,980
out of the house here because it's it's

1278
00:54:48,269 --> 00:55:17,880
weird here there's nothing to really go

1279
00:54:49,980 --> 00:55:30,780
have fun enjoy the day I was in

1280

1496
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:21,488
first I've taken a bunch of dads tonight

1497
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,828
so I want to remind you guys we're gonna

1498
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:25,719
change the name of the podcast the show

1499
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:27,429
is not going to be the agriculture

1500
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:29,699
podcast for much longer it will be

1501
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:31,809
called the grow from your heart podcast

1502
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:34,418
like I've said before there's an

1503
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:36,849
agricultural educational entity that has

1504
01:03:34,418 --> 01:03:38,438
the moniker I grow taken and also I was

1505
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:40,989
told that iTunes doesn't appreciate

1506
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:42,308
people ripping off the eye so we're just

1507
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:43,389
gonna be respectful we're gonna change

1508
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:44,528
it to grow from your heart because

1509
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,628
that's what this is all about I've

1510
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:47,349
always said grow from your heart if you

1511
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:48,848
draw your herb

1512
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:51,189
your cannabis your medicine from your

1513
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:52,509
heart you will produce better cannabis

1514
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:55,568
if you don't grow your cannabis from

1515
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:57,759
your wallet or your ego or your camera I

1516
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:59,588
know I take a lot of pictures but I grow

1517
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:00,759
dank herb because I grow from my heart

1518
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:01,958
that's why I'm able to take the dank

1519
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:04,088
pictures I'm not thinking about my

1520
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:06,188
wallet I'm not thinking about the

1521
01:04:04,088 --> 01:04:08,619
harvest weight pay attention to that

1522
01:04:06,188 --> 01:04:10,509
stuff but I'm in the grow room I'm

1523
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:12,849
thinking about what's gonna happen after

1524
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:15,608
I grow this herb properly that's great

1525
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:18,099
flush it after I chop it down after a

1526
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:20,288
trim it after I cure it after I give it

1527
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:22,028
to my patients that smoke this cannabis

1528
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,379
I've got an older friend his initials

1529
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:24,969
are DC I don't really want to call him

1530
01:04:23,378 --> 01:04:26,708
out on the show but he's who I think of

1531
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,818
when I think of medical cannabis it's a

1532
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:30,969
good friend of mine and I'm his

1533
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:34,148
caregiver what I see him consume the

1534
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:36,429
herb that I put my love into I can see

1535
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:38,648
him get something inside of him feels

1536
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:40,659
better and it's not just a physical

1537
01:04:38,648 --> 01:04:41,409
thing it's not just him getting high

1538
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:43,000
there's

1539
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:44,589
emotional thing that happens to that guy

1540
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,050
when my medicine makes him feel better

1541
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:49,059
and that emotional thing happens back to

1542
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:51,519
me and it fulfills my heart so I grow

1543
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:52,539
from my heart and you should grow from

1544
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,380
your heart as well and I think it'll

1545
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:58,779
improve your outlook on your weed it'll

1546
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,070
improve your cannabis overall it will

1547
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:06,750
improve your relationship with your

1548
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:08,620
patients from the scale from your camera

1549
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,210
from your heart so the girl from your

1550
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:15,460
heart podcast that's our new motto grow

1551
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:16,869
from your heart requires a new logo I

1552
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,460
can't change the name until I have a

1553
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:20,710
sweet-ass new logo so if any of you

1554
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,380
artists out there would like to throw me

1555
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:25,840
down a grow from your heart podcast

1556
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,579
hosted by Rasta Jeff logo I would

1557
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,380
appreciate it I don't have a lot of

1558
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:31,150
money to tell you the truth but I would

1559
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,800
compensate you in some way that made you

1560
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,960
happy it may take time it may take

1561
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,570
payments it may take multiple gifts over

1562
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,610
time we will work something out because

1563
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,080
uh I like to pay back my community that

1564
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:43,090
helps me out now you like to help your

1565
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:47,440
community out so do me a favor make me a

1566
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:49,180
logo I have this vision actually it's a

1567
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,679
seed like if you've ever grown pot when

1568
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,119
you germinate seeds they crack open and

1569
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,889
the tap root comes out of there

1570
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:55,659
when that cracks open it kind of makes

1571
01:05:53,889 --> 01:06:00,549
the shape of a heart so if you can kind

1572
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:02,619
of make that into actually turning into

1573
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:04,690
maybe I don't know you get creative but

1574
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:06,130
I want to see that heart coming out or

1575
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,450
just whatever with the heart in it or

1576
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,230
grow from your heart of course I like

1577
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:10,329
red yellow and green

1578
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,800
I'm a Rastafarian if you do that I've

1579
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:15,340
never said this on a podcast if you're

1580
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,930
gonna make a Rastafarian themed logo the

1581
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,730
red goes on the bottom you guys it's red

1582
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:20,440
gold and green yes red yellow green but

1583
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,480
the red is on the bottom so it's

1584
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,039
actually green yellow red

1585
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,929
so do that properly if you're gonna make

1586
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:26,920
me a logo because I'm a Rasta and I want

1587
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:28,419
it right because it's almost

1588
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,829
disrespectful to put your logo with the

1589
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,750
colors upside down if you're bringing it

1590
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:33,009
and a Rasta way I'm not gonna [ __ ]

1591
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,510
about it I'm just saying do it the right

1592
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,920
way if you're a real Rasta you'll

1593
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,960
understand why you want it the right way

1594
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,340
so if I put the American flag upside

1595
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,690
down it would piss a lot of Americans

1596
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,340
off so just imagine you people getting

1597
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:43,750
the Rasta flag backwards it kind of

1598
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,920
frustrates some people I don't give too

1599
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:50,619
much of a [ __ ] about it I'm just letting

1600
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:51,880
you know that you're doing it wrong I've

1601
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:53,079
been playing the mystic roots band it

1602
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,829
sounds awesome but wouldn't it be a lot

1603
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:55,119
cooler if I had

1604
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:57,519
timaeus theme song that was like

1605
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,630
something about drove from your heart I

1606
01:06:57,518 --> 01:07:00,608
don't even know how it would go but

1607
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:04,630
maybe some dancehall reggae or something

1608
01:07:00,608 --> 01:07:06,429

1637
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,989

1638
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:06,489
the show to the next level

1639
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:08,048
I've been putting more time into the

1640
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:09,190
shows and doing more research because I

1641

01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:16,170

1653
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:37,088

01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:39,009

1660
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:50,440
probably this dude says bro I love the

1661
01:08:48,219 --> 01:08:52,000
podcast it's the first podcast I've been

1662
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:55,269
into I'm gonna have to start from the

1663
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,349
beginning and catch up okay I'm

1664
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:58,690
embarrassed that you're gonna do that

1665
01:08:56,349 --> 01:09:00,369
because honestly well let me not say I'm

1666
01:08:58,689 --> 01:09:03,729
embarrassed I guess I'm proud now the

1667
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:05,639
first 25 episodes or so I didn't know

1668
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:07,979
what I was doing

1669
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,450
I turn on the microphone and just blurt

1670
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:11,250
it out a bunch of [ __ ] whatever came out

1671
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:12,779
of my face is how the show went and then

1672
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,369
I started making too many notes and it

1673
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,599
got a little weird but I feel like I'm

1674
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:17,189
kind of comfortable with the microphone

1675
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,560
now I just turn it on I start I make a

1676
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:21,750
few bullet points and start going and it

1677
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,390
all comes out I'm not so so hyper

1678
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:25,500
critical of it now but dude party McFly

1679

1704
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:22,829
on Twitter my next tweet came from

1705
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,710
Roadrunner it's at Road underscore

1706
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:28,500
Runner 420 he said listening from the UK

1707
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:30,210
still underground here but great to see

1708
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,060
you guys leading the way for us great

1709
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:34,470
show keep it up dude thanks a lot those

1710
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,060
words of encouragement mean a lot to me

1711
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,320
like I was saying everybody wants to

1712
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,030
hear that they're doing right

1713
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:42,199
sometimes you just put a bunch of work

1714
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:44,309
in nobody says anything and you're like

1715
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:47,789
killing it so awesome thank you we've

1716
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:50,610
gotten 6,500 listens on some episodes

1717
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:52,710
the episode with King Cola is probably

1718
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:54,179
gonna hit 10,000 episodes eventually

1719
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:56,069
that will be the first one to do it

1720
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:58,140
which is remarkable because it's a newer

1721
01:10:56,069 --> 01:11:00,420
episode and there's been a lot of time

1722
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,950
on other shows and they haven't been

1723
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,569
listening to nearly as much as the

1724
01:11:01,949 --> 01:11:05,670
episodes with King Cola so shot out to

1725
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:08,429
King Cola and episode 35 with drying and

1726
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:10,039
curing also has been a huge success if

1727
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:12,180
you guys haven't listened to that one

1728
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:14,399
it's time go back and listen to number

1729
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,250
35 if I had a recommendation for you 35

1730
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:16,839
and then

1731
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,069
and the ones with keen Cola I don't

1732
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:21,279
remember the numbers I could pause it

1733
01:11:18,069 --> 01:11:23,949
look hold on alright I went back and

1734
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:27,699
checked I honestly think that from 35 on

1735
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:29,109
is where if 35 through 45 are some of

1736
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:31,539
our best episodes ever there are a

1737
01:11:29,109 --> 01:11:34,119
couple in there 44 is random chatter

1738
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:36,909
because we got chatty and then 41 is

1739
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,039
chatty stoners but for the most part the

1740
01:11:36,909 --> 01:11:42,519
35 through 45 are some of my favorite

1741
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:45,489
most proud episodes 45 more about

1742
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,590
organics with King Kola 43 intro to

1743
01:11:45,489 --> 01:11:50,050
organics with King Cola those are some

1744
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:52,029
great episodes number 42 intro to NPK

1745
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:54,130
that got a lot of response ah the

1746
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:57,099
episodes about building your grow 39 and

1747
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:58,960
40 those really crushed it 37 was

1748

planning your gross space that did a lot

1749
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,300

1750
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:05,829

1882
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,590
mom spoiled the [ __ ] out of me for

1883
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:45,170
Christmas she knows that I've been

1884
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:47,630
looking at this a Nikon camera and so on

1885
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:49,970
Christmas the gifts were all done and

1886
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:51,409
then she slid this other box toward me

1887
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,030
and just smiled and had a tear in her

1888
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:54,349
eye and when I opened it I kind of got a

1889
01:16:53,029 --> 01:16:57,800
tear in my eye also because she hooked

1890
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:59,450
me up the Nikon d3200 hundred the

1891
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,850
package with the extra lens and the bag

1892
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:04,970

1894
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:07,730

1896

1897
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:12,488

1898
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:14,349

1899
01:17:12,488 --> 01:17:15,819

a little bit

1925
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:08,829
yeah that's the sound of me calming down

1926
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:11,470
I do that [ __ ] sometimes I need to calm

1927
01:18:08,829 --> 01:18:13,779

album and traffic's medicated goo begins

2051
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:21,219
to play Steve Winwood's

2052
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:23,199
wistful tenor sweeps through the

Centennial seeds laboratory my own

2054
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,339
homegrown recipe you'll see it through

2055
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:29,229
everyone stole from Steve Winwood home

2056
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:31,060
says his foot tapping as he injects a

2057
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:31,429
syringe of dark syrupy liquid into his

2058
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:34,039
gas

2059
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:35,840
from chromatograph no one is stealing

2060
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:37,970
from homes a self-taught scientist

2061
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,310
engineer farmer and cannabis seed geek

2062
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:42,320
who next month will take a rare step to

2063
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:44,930
apply for a patent on a laboriously

2064
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:47,210
created cannabis superstring if it is

2065
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:49,579
awarded the US patent on homes medical

2066
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:51,859
grade Auto two strain will be the first

2067
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:53,449
to protect a cannabis plant and a first

2068
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:55,429
step in establishing plant breeder

2069
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:58,250
rights for growers who only a few years

2070
01:22:55,430 --> 01:23:00,650
ago were considered criminals I said the

2071
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:03,859
the strain is called Auto - it's spelled

2072
01:23:00,649 --> 01:23:05,809
OTT oh and then the Roman numeral - it's

2073
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,309
not Auto like Auto flower so I just want

2074
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:09,020
to clear that up it's the same word

2075
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:10,400
essentially I'm saying Auto and I would

2076
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:12,140
say Auto if it were spelled the other

2077
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,389
way so if you guys are haters of Auto

2078
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:16,579
flowers that's not what it is it's just

2079
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:19,340
Auto like the dude from The Simpsons

2080
01:23:16,579 --> 01:23:21,409
it's probably got some Canadian

2081
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:24,020
influence I would assume right anyway

2082
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:25,489
this industry came up in stealth born in

2083
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:27,140
basements and crawlspaces Holmes said

2084
01:23:25,489 --> 01:23:28,670
but now with companies forming and

2085
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:30,230
making larger investments the desire to

2086
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,180
protect intellectual property is

2087
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:34,909
becoming paramount bleeding-edge stuff

2088
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:36,619
right here this is kind of hits home to

2089
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:40,430
me because I breed seeds and I create

2090
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:41,539
strains and I see people I don't wanna

2091
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,130
say ripping them off because I don't

2092
01:23:41,539 --> 01:23:44,659
know if they thought of it before me if

2093
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:48,050
they just happen to post it to Instagram

2094
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:50,539
after me but people we like to borrow

2095
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:52,520
names in this industry four strains we

2096
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:53,329
we think we're coming up with something

2097
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,170
original you guys are gonna hear a

2098
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:57,159
thumping noise I'm moving this

2099
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:59,359
microphone it's sliding sorry here we go

2100
01:23:57,159 --> 01:24:00,590
sorry if that sounds like [ __ ] the

2101
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,529
recording I'm not gonna censor that her

2102
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:06,319
edit that out at all so making stuff my

2103
01:24:03,529 --> 01:24:08,719
strains get stolen often and I can't

2104
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,369
complain about it because I'm actually

2105
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,020
using other people's strains to make

2106
01:24:10,369 --> 01:24:14,659
mine somebody had to make the seeds for

2107
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:15,890
me to breed with but just give credit I

2108
01:24:14,659 --> 01:24:19,010
guess but now people are gonna be able

2109
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:21,650
to patent stuff so what I'm worried

2110
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:24,440
about mainly are people with more money

2111
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:25,909
going to Punk me and patent my [ __ ] and

2112
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,439
squeeze me right out are you gonna see

2113
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:29,930
other people claiming that they own

2114
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:31,489
Kabletown that's what I'm worried about

2115
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,829
and I don't I don't know the legal parts

2116
01:24:31,489 --> 01:24:35,899
of this enough to know but I do know

2117
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:37,519
that I don't have any money compared to

2118
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:39,079
a lot of these people I am small time

2119
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,210
compared a lot of these people compared

2120
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:43,489
to green house compared to the callee

2121
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:44,779
connection compared to DNA I am nobody

2122
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:45,260
and those guys could squeeze me out

2123
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:47,359
tomorrow

2124
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:49,789
if they wanted to but luckily we're a

2125
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,288
friendly industry big business doesn't

2126
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:52,698
give a [ __ ] about friendly industry

2127
01:24:51,288 --> 01:24:53,809
they'll squeeze us all out by doing this

2128
01:24:52,698 --> 01:24:54,979
kind of stuff because they've got the

2129
01:24:53,809 --> 01:24:57,288
money that's what I fear but I'm a

2130
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:59,328
paranoid hippie I've been on too many

2131
01:24:57,288 --> 01:25:00,529
fish parking lots to have a clear head

2132
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:04,518
about that kind of [ __ ] I just always

2133
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:06,559
think that more of the article it says

2134
01:25:04,519 --> 01:25:08,780
indeed gone are the days when pie-eyed

2135
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:10,400
long hairs haphazardly hurled fallen

2136
01:25:08,779 --> 01:25:13,009
into jungles of pot plants hoping to

2137
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:15,888
meld two strains and that's such a great

2138
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:20,449
cliche in one [ __ ] sentence I love

2139
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:28,819
that pie-eyed long hairs so you can see

2140
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:30,500
those guys early fallen they're just got

2141
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:33,948
this male plant there's beaten into the

2142
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:35,179
room in the jungles of pot plants so no

2143
01:25:33,948 --> 01:25:38,750
strain selection here let's just put a

2144
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:40,130
bunch of females in here sorry I'm just

2145
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,578
talking [ __ ] about the sentence it was

2146
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,519
great

2147
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:46,250
hoping to meld two strains today's top

2148
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:47,329
readers are geneticists taking years to

2149
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,488
weed through carefully engineered

2150
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:51,500
generations of cannabis to elevate the

2151
01:25:49,488 --> 01:25:52,848
most desired traits that's a pretty

2152
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,158
accurate statement I will agree with

2153
01:25:52,849 --> 01:25:57,319
that some of the new super strains are

2154
01:25:55,158 --> 01:25:59,179
high in cannabidiol or CBD one of

2155
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,158
several dozen cannabinoid chemical

2156
01:25:59,179 --> 01:26:04,868
compounds in cannabis and the plant's

2157
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:04,868
major non psychoactive ingredient

2158
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:09,618
compound but then he said ingredient and

2159
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:11,658
then that ruined him

2160
01:26:09,618 --> 01:26:13,069
I'm so critical these guys articles and

2161
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:15,049
I bet I say some really dumb [ __ ] on the

2162
01:26:13,069 --> 01:26:16,549
podcast cuz I'm high so these guys have

2163
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,900
editors and proofreaders and [ __ ] I'm

2164
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:22,309
just you're spouting it out I've taken

2165
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:23,658
dabs and drank monta and can't be held

2166
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:30,260
accountable for anything I say after

2167
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:32,988
that epic seizures prompting widespread

2168
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:35,300
calls for additional research other more

2169
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:36,828
utilitarian super strains are resistant

2170
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,510
to mites or the crop killing powdery

2171
01:26:36,828 --> 01:26:41,868

2175
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:47,599
sounds like we only have that here

2176
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:50,118
powdery mildew all over the place bro I

2177
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:53,300
don't know why you're single in Colorado

2178
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:54,589
it does happen here all right I'll quit

2179
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,599
ranting about that part let's get more

2180
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,670
into the article here oh where was it

2181
01:26:56,599 --> 01:27:00,409
some super strains are suit

2182
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:02,690
superstone ii with sky high levels of

2183

tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the

2184
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:09,229
psychoactive compound in cannabis s real

2185
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,449
way down there's like seven answer here

2186
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:14,178
we go the gas chromatograph is homes key

2187
01:27:11,448 --> 01:27:15,678
in shaping Auto to a high CBD low THC

2193
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:28,039
level in the substance that line will be

2194
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:31,039
the baseline for a measurement of auto

values from the gas chromatograph those

2198
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:40,580
figures reveal his painstaking progress

2199
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,579
toward breeding the THC out and the CBD

2200
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:45,050
into his treasured varietal it is in

2201
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:46,850
many ways the result of a lifelong

2202
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:48,679
career dedicated to breeding growing

01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:53,329
most useful cannabis plants as Winwood

2205
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:55,310
seems the oft covered dear mr. fantasy

2206
01:27:53,329 --> 01:27:57,769
Holmes shares his plans to protect Auto

2207
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:59,539
two but ranks among the most valuable of

2208
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:01,790
his collection of 400 varieties of

2209
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:03,948
cannabis seeds both marijuana and him

2210
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:07,069
most of which are stored in additional

2211
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:08,359
freezer in his lafayette lab in addition

2212
01:28:07,069 --> 01:28:10,340
to the patent he hopes to be the first

2213
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:12,289
cannabis breeder to secure protection

2214
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:14,270
under the plant variety Protection Act

2215
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:18,920
the seminal plant breeders rights

2216
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:20,810
legislation from 1970 the value of that

2217
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:23,659
seed long term could be very very

2218
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:24,980
valuable an annuity said Holmes a father

2219
01:28:23,659 --> 01:28:26,779
of two who serves on the state's

2220
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:28,759
industrial hemp Advisory Committee and

2221
01:28:26,779 --> 01:28:30,679
is collaborate collaborating on the

2222
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,409
University of Colorado's groundbreaking

2223
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:34,550
cannabis genomic research initiative and

2224
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:36,529
if you guys haven't checked that out you

2225
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:39,500
should I'll say it again it's the

2226
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:41,300
cannabis genomic research initiative

2227
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,649
there's a link to it in this article on

2228
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,900
the cannabis so if you can find this

2229
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:46,849
article on the cannabis it's the article

2230
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:50,479
about pot growers new quest US patent

2231
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,320
patent protection this link is in that

2232
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:53,599
article

2233
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:55,219
so everyone who does this wants to

2234
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,230
produce something with durability he

2235
01:28:55,219 --> 01:29:00,469
said a seed with good utility that

2236
01:28:57,229 --> 01:29:02,988
produces well can have longitude II for

2237
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:04,909
generations which is very true I've read

2238
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:07,549
a few strains that I can keep those

2239
01:29:04,909 --> 01:29:09,289
seeds around and that Capleton the

2240
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:10,310
Bounty Killer will be good forever I'm

2241
01:29:09,289 --> 01:29:11,189
gonna get back into the article here

2242
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:14,250
that was kind of a rant

2243
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:16,649
right God says Holmes is sort of a

2244
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,300
modern-day Luther Luther Burbank who you

2245
01:29:16,649 --> 01:29:19,920
should read about guys the pirate

2246
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,449
pioneering American botanist and

2247
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,069
horticulturist who developed more than

2248
01:29:21,448 --> 01:29:25,309
eight hundred varieties and strains of

2249
01:29:23,069 --> 01:29:27,809
plants in the late 1800s and early 1900s

2250
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:30,120
his name was Luther Burbank if you want

2251
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:31,920
to google him wikipedia that guy

2252
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:33,569
Burbank faced intellectual property

2253
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,420
challenges in his career as he created

2254
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:38,569
still Harold peaches plums daisies and

2255
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:41,130
the world dominant Burbank russet potato

2256
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:43,170
Holmes follows Burbank lead offering a

2257
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:44,969
few types of seeds to a single large

2258
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:46,680
distributor who can flood the market in

2259
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:48,329
the first year before anyone can take it

2260
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:51,150
as their own by cloning the young

2261
01:29:48,329 --> 01:29:55,559
seedlings this guy's idea that's a good

2262
01:29:51,149 --> 01:29:58,409
idea he's gonna put out so many seeds so

2263
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:01,170
quickly that everybody will know it's

2264
01:29:58,409 --> 01:30:02,760
his because it'll be flooded but nobody

2265
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:04,109
will be able to claim it before they can

2266
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,610
cut a clone because he'll be so well

2267
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:07,649
known for putting it out that's pretty

2268
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:10,079
smart it puts out so many they're like

2269
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:11,698
oh it's got to be him because everyone's

2270
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:14,250
got the seeds yeah that makes sense

2271
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:15,659
I like that's a good idea hoarding

2272
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,890
certain strains when I make seeds no I'm

2273
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:18,809
just make a whole bunch of them until I

2274
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,590
can do that I wouldn't do that I'm just

2275
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,150
joking sorry guys

2276
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:23,550
by the time copycats have cloned

2277
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:26,099
holmes's strains he's already he already

2278
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:27,750
has made his money he also licenses the

2279
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,280
use of his heirloom seeds but not the

2280
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:32,310
extra-special seeds he doesn't want

2281
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:34,170
copied really the focus - any patent

2282
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:35,760
protection is non licensing and careful

2283
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:37,800
selection of distributors homestead

2284
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,780
state trademark protection can safeguard

2285
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,159
the name of an innovation within a

2286
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:42,899
state's borders but protecting

2287
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:45,689
intellectual property through state law

2288
01:30:42,899 --> 01:30:47,789
is a bandage patents are exclusively

2289
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:50,759
federal marijuana is illegal under

2290
01:30:47,789 --> 01:30:52,890
federal law and federal law trumps state

2291
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,960
law so this guy could get completely

2292
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,090
denied for his attempt at patenting his

2293
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,800
cannabis strain but if he does he's

2294
01:30:57,090 --> 01:31:00,510
going to open the floodgates for a lot

2295
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,719
of [ __ ] and people will start

2296
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:05,270
panting their own strains I bet you that

2297
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:07,439
means I don't have to get on the game

2298
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:10,730
get lawyer it up a little bit harder for

2299
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,809
a lawyer that knows about patent laws -

2300
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:14,968
vast you have to have your hands in

2301
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,289
everything now to be able to keep up in

2302
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,969
this kind of a business if you just want

2303
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:20,159
to move to Colorado and get in the

2304
01:31:17,969 --> 01:31:21,960
cannabis industry I recommend you do

2305
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:23,279
like a year of research before you get

2306
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,310
into it maybe come here and talk to

2307
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:26,289
somebody who's in the end

2308
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:27,850
Street I can help you out a little bit I

2309
01:31:26,289 --> 01:31:28,420
don't know a lot about getting into the

2310
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:30,130
industry

2311
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:32,109
I don't like into if you want a

2312
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:33,279
dispensary or something and I don't know

2313
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:37,509
how to get you into there that's gonna

2314
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:39,969
be hard so be careful let's see in this

2315
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:41,980
episode I wanted to talk about the new

2316
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:43,630
year is coming up and the new year is

2317
01:31:41,979 --> 01:31:45,069
always a good time everybody says they

2318
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:47,560
want to do New Year's resolutions and

2319
01:31:45,069 --> 01:31:51,039
stuff I think it's a good time to start

2320
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,210
a new grow calendar or a schedule I kind

2321
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,519
of make a game plan

2322
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:57,369
clean up your grow room get everything

2323
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,630
started fresh again and then instead of

2324
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:59,890
just cutting a bunch of clones and

2325
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:01,449
having a bunch of plants and veg and

2326
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:02,860
having some [ __ ] over here and some more

2327
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:05,319
[ __ ] over here think about what you're

2328
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:07,269
gonna do think about how many lights you

2329
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:09,369
have in each space how many flowering

2330
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:11,500
lights do you have how many plants fit

2331
01:32:09,369 --> 01:32:12,430
under each of those lights how long do

2332
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,579
they take to flower

2333
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:18,369
okay so you got about 65 days underneath

2334
01:32:15,579 --> 01:32:19,899
this light right well in about 65 days

2335
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:21,340
you need more plants to go under there

2336
01:32:19,899 --> 01:32:23,349
but you need a couple days to clean that

2337
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,699
you got a trim you got to sweep up you

2338
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:26,170
gotta wipe the walls down you gotta

2339
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:27,369
clean all the dirt out you got to repot

2340
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:30,220
you got to get [ __ ] back in there

2341
01:32:27,369 --> 01:32:31,569
remember that in like nine weeks you

2342
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:34,030
need more plants in there so you got to

2343
01:32:31,569 --> 01:32:35,619
cut clones about three to four maybe

2344
01:32:34,029 --> 01:32:36,969
five weeks before that depending on how

2345
01:32:35,619 --> 01:32:39,069
much space you have you gotta get your

2346
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:40,840
[ __ ] ready so start planning I think

2347
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:44,309
it's a good time for you guys to start

2348
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:46,390
working on an advanced grow calendar I

2349
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:48,100
don't know how you want to do it there

2350
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:49,780
are a lot of ways to go about it do it

2351
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,190
your way is what I recommend maybe we'll

2352
01:32:49,779 --> 01:32:52,869
make an episode out of that but it's the

2353
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:54,279
start of the year coming up and just

2354
01:32:52,869 --> 01:32:55,750
make a calendar because if you pop a

2355
01:32:54,279 --> 01:32:57,219
bunch of seeds you cut a bunch of clones

2356
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,510
and you got a vet roomful and a

2357
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:00,159
flowering roomful and you don't have a

2358
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:01,630
full plan of where those plants are

2359
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:04,019
going you're gonna run into some

2360
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:06,100
problems overcrowding causes problems

2361
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:07,450
overcrowding promotes problems you can't

2362
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,039
see that plan on the bottom you can't

2363
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:10,329
tell there was a spider mite infestation

2364
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,069
there you got spider mites everywhere

2365
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:14,559
you got way too many plants it's out of

2366
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:16,599
control just be diligent think in

2367
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,280
advance think ahead of yourself be like

2368
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,110
five steps ahead that's how you be a

2369
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:21,639
good grower kind of try to predict

2370
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:23,710
what's gonna happen in your plants don't

2371
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,960
just watch and see what happens be like

2372
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,489
oh this is going to happen because I've

2373
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:30,159
grown weed a million times and I've paid

2374
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:31,630
attention at least ten of them all right

2375
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:32,680
I'm ranting again but it's really

2376
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:35,260
important I think and it's a start of

2377
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:36,550
year so it's time for that to happen it

2378
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,110
would be a good time for all of that

2379
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:38,400
include

2380
01:33:37,109 --> 01:33:39,960
[ __ ] right at the start of the year if

2381
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:41,849
it's if your carbon filters are all

2382
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,439
mucky buy some new carbon filters if

2383
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:45,449
your bulbs are all shitty get some new

2384
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:48,839
bulbs it's the start of the year spoil

2385
01:33:45,448 --> 01:33:51,388
your Gardens they spoil you back that's

2386
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,539
my advice that's my personal advice from

2387
01:33:51,389 --> 01:33:55,889
the from the heart of Rasta Jeff I must

2388
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:57,420

2389

2720
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:54,140

2721
01:44:49,539 --> 01:44:55,880
lemon candy and I said is it just candy

2722
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:57,619
and he said yeah man my thing is to just

2723
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,789
bring weird candies to the show and

2724
01:44:57,619 --> 01:45:00,289
they're delicious and so I took this

2725
01:44:58,789 --> 01:45:01,789
lemon candy from him and it was amazing

2726
01:45:00,289 --> 01:45:03,619
later on in the show he offered me

2727
01:45:01,789 --> 01:45:05,269
something and when he pulled it out of

2728
01:45:03,619 --> 01:45:06,349
his pocket the guy next to him patted me

2729
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:08,570
on the shoulder and said eat one of

2730
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:11,289
those man and when I tried it it was

2731
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:13,309
amazing it was something I all the

2732
01:45:11,289 --> 01:45:14,930
packaging was in another language it's

2733
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:16,070
like Chinese or Korean or something I'm

2734
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,119
sorry if that's offensive I don't know

2735
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:20,329
the [ __ ] language it is it looks

2736
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:22,069
Chinese to me and it was mango flavored

2737
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:23,720
and whatever it was amazing today they

2738
01:45:22,069 --> 01:45:25,069
did not have drugs in it so I was pretty

2739
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:27,409

wonderful thank you for letting have a

2787
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:01,538
good time I did mention I got a little

2788
01:46:59,349 --> 01:47:03,130
cold I guess I got some sniffles brides

2789
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:05,889
sniffle wrecking the mic to do that no

2790
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:08,440
it's rude but I was -16° one night and

2791
01:47:05,889 --> 01:47:10,269
you gotta go from the car into the

2792
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:12,549
concert venue and the minus 16 and then

2793
01:47:10,269 --> 01:47:14,409
in the concert I just I took off all my

2794
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:15,998
jackets and I had my t-shirt and my

2795
01:47:14,408 --> 01:47:18,819
pants on and my shoes on my hat and I

2796
01:47:15,998 --> 01:47:20,978
was sweating my ass off so you got to

2797
01:47:18,819 --> 01:47:23,109
try to negotiate the cold and then the

2798
01:47:20,979 --> 01:47:24,639
super hot heat and then back to the car

2799
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:26,738
again and then let the car warm up and

2800
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,599
get to the hotel so I think all the

2801
01:47:26,738 --> 01:47:30,848
climate changes I may have caught a

2802
01:47:28,599 --> 01:47:32,800
little cold here and also I smoked like

2803
01:47:30,849 --> 01:47:34,179
45 joints over three nights at these

2804
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,550
concerts but I rolled a bunch of joints

2805
01:47:34,179 --> 01:47:38,349
it's more like 45 joints with strangers

2806
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,849
and I'm wondering if maybe I got a

2807
01:47:38,349 --> 01:47:42,760
little bit of string cheese incident

2808
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:44,349
look flu but whatever I'll live got some

2809
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,579
emergency and some yerba maté a I'm

2810
01:47:44,349 --> 01:47:47,559
gonna be just fine

2811
01:47:45,578 --> 01:47:49,090
I was fun meeting a lot of Instagram

2812
01:47:47,559 --> 01:47:50,170
followers I met a lot of people they

2813
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:51,760

01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:02,229

next note I'm sure you noticed at the

2862
01:49:25,939 --> 01:49:29,479
beginning of the show that I said

2863
01:49:27,229 --> 01:49:32,500
welcome to the hydro culture podcast I'm

2864
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:34,638
doing my best to roll out the new name

2865
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:36,710
I'm doing it slowly so I don't lose

2866
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,000
people so if it looks confusing for a

2867
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,899
little bit I'm sure you guys are aware

2868
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,300
of what's going on if you're listening

2869
01:49:38,899 --> 01:49:42,948
but we are in the process of changing

2870
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:45,409
the name from agriculture to grow from

2871
01:49:42,948 --> 01:49:48,559
your heart bear with me I still could

2872
01:49:45,408 --> 01:49:50,089
use more logos somebody sent me one logo

2873
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,889
but I asked for a couple of adjustments

2874
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:54,110
it just they didn't fit the way I needed

2875
01:49:51,889 --> 01:49:55,579
it to fit to make squares that but I

2876
01:49:54,109 --> 01:50:00,829
need a square logo so if you can send me

2877
01:49:55,579 --> 01:50:02,179
a 1400 by 1400 pixel image with the girl

2878
01:50:00,829 --> 01:50:02,779
from your heart podcast I would love

2879
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:05,810
that

2880
01:50:02,779 --> 01:50:07,099
I also need a song if you guys want to

2881
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:08,300
if anybody out there is an artist and

2882
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:10,849
you want to make a girl from your heart

2883
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:11,599
podcast theme song I will compensate you

2884
01:50:10,849 --> 01:50:14,029
in the future

2885
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:16,460
that'd be really cool so I'm starting to

2886
01:50:14,029 --> 01:50:18,198
change the title in social media places

2887
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:19,760
also I'm waiting on a couple artists to

2888
01:50:18,198 --> 01:50:21,710
submit some logos that I've commissioned

2889
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,210
once I've got all the artwork I can

2890
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:25,579
fully roll out the new title and start

2891
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:27,710
switching everything over I'm hoping by

2892
01:50:25,579 --> 01:50:28,819
episode 50 that we can actually just

2893
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:30,319
call this the girl from your heart

2894
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:34,130
podcast and everything will be switched

2895
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:35,658
right over let's see also there's

2896
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:38,029
something that I've been considering

2897
01:50:35,658 --> 01:50:40,809
this is just a personal thing for myself

2898
01:50:38,029 --> 01:50:44,840
that I'm considering doing I may cancel

2899
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:48,560
the Instagram for the podcast there is

2900
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:51,409
an agriculture podcast Instagram that I

2901
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:54,619
haven't posted anything to in several

2902
01:50:51,408 --> 01:50:55,969
weeks honestly it kind of it's just a

2903
01:50:54,618 --> 01:50:57,920
distraction there's not a lot it's a

2904
01:50:55,969 --> 01:50:59,539
podcast and some of my guests don't want

2905
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,210
me to take their picture Jesse doesn't

2906
01:50:59,539 --> 01:51:03,859
want his face on Adam is cool with it

2907
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:06,170
Mike is cool with it but some people do

2908
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:08,750
not want to be seen and I feel like I'm

2909
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:10,550
just going to over do my Instagram

2910
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:12,349
presence by having the I read genetics

2911
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:14,599
and the I grow culture or the girl from

2912
01:51:12,349 --> 01:51:17,179
your heart podcast so I'm thinking about

2913
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:19,010
just combining the two into one entity

2914
01:51:17,179 --> 01:51:20,929
and maybe I'll start posting a few

2915
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:24,380
things from the girl from your heart

2916
01:51:20,929 --> 01:51:25,699
podcast on the IRA genetics Instagram so

2917
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:27,859
if you're not already following IRA

2918
01:51:25,698 --> 01:51:28,948
genetics on Instagram go there and

2919
01:51:27,859 --> 01:51:30,929
follow that

2920
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:33,328
because I'm really considering taking

2921
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:34,679
down the Instagram for the podcast it's

2922
01:51:33,328 --> 01:51:38,279
just a distraction it's one more thing

2923
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:39,748
to worry about um I'm also considering

2924
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:42,090
and I'm not committing to this but it's

2925
01:51:39,748 --> 01:51:43,978
highly likely somebody had a talk with

2926
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:45,389
me and it got me thinking but I'm

2927
01:51:43,979 --> 01:51:47,429
considering cancelling my YouTube

2928
01:51:45,389 --> 01:51:49,590
account for the iGrow culture girl from

2929
01:51:47,429 --> 01:51:50,998
your heart podcast you'd say why would

2930
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:54,860
you do that people are listening they

2931
01:51:50,998 --> 01:51:56,639
are but not as many and I'm not

2932
01:51:54,859 --> 01:51:59,578
appreciate the people that are listening

2933
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,929
but it takes me a long time to get those

2934
01:51:59,578 --> 01:52:03,538
episodes up there I feel if I cancel

2935
01:52:00,929 --> 01:52:04,679
that until I can focus more on the show

2936
01:52:03,538 --> 01:52:06,779
and if I didn't have to create as many

2937
01:52:04,679 --> 01:52:09,118
different types of media I could make

2938
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:10,498
better content just for the audio

2939
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,630
podcast I'd rather spend the time

2940
01:52:10,498 --> 01:52:15,300
creating content editing video and

2941
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:16,920
setting up a camera and lighting and

2942
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:18,570
editing the video again and then

2943
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:20,550
rendering the video for YouTube

2944
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:22,319
it takes a few it's just a few more

2945
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:25,650
steps but all those steps matter I could

2946
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:26,880
spend that much time preparing for this

2947
01:52:25,649 --> 01:52:28,288
show and making the show that much

2948
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,449
better having that many more details

2949
01:52:28,288 --> 01:52:33,090
being that much more prepared getting

2950
01:52:30,448 --> 01:52:35,969
that much better of a guest on so the

2951
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:37,920
Instagram and the YouTube may go away

2952
01:52:35,969 --> 01:52:39,328
and that's just personal things I'm

2953
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,699
trying to free it more time to take what

2954
01:52:39,328 --> 01:52:43,708
I'm really passionate about to the next

2955
01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:45,658
level I don't want to drag my feet on

2956
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:48,569
things that are not fulfilling me

2957
01:52:45,658 --> 01:52:49,828
honestly so I may eliminate those and I

2958
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:52,889
do appreciate the guys that watch me on

2959
01:52:49,828 --> 01:52:54,840
YouTube I've only gotten like 17 or 18

2960
01:52:52,889 --> 01:52:56,429
maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because

2961
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,800
like I said it takes me an hour to make

2962
01:52:56,429 --> 01:53:00,328
each one and I feel like I could I'm

2963
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,820
repeating myself I could just spend that

2964
01:53:00,328 --> 01:53:05,429
time doing stuff so I may take them down

2965
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:08,158
I don't I don't want to abandon people

2966
01:53:05,429 --> 01:53:09,449
but if you are watching on YouTube you

2967
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,149
should be able to find it on the high

2968
01:53:09,448 --> 01:53:14,669
grow culture or the IRA genetics website

2969
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:16,078
every podcast is there and if you've got

2970
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:16,889
a browser it works the same and there's

2971
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:19,408
nothing you're not missing anything

2972
01:53:16,889 --> 01:53:20,760
visually really so those are mostly

2973
01:53:19,408 --> 01:53:22,828
distractions I feel like I'm gonna stop

2974
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:26,090
contributing to those just so that I can

2975
01:53:22,828 --> 01:53:28,170
improve the audio part of this show so

2976
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:30,150
like I'm talking about that for a long

2977
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:31,649
time I need to move on let's see I

2978
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:34,109

2979

hat name only my display name so that's

2992
01:54:00,109 --> 01:54:04,039
something you can pay attention to let's

2993
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:05,840
see I wrote a bunch of notes and I have

2994
01:54:04,039 --> 01:54:07,100
them in my computer and I'm scrolling

2995
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,659
through the computer and looking at a

2996
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:12,430
piece of paper trying to read two things

2997
01:54:08,659 --> 01:54:14,510
at once and it's honestly not working so

2998
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,829
episode 50 is coming up you guys have

2999
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:17,480

01:54:15,829 --> 01:54:19,670

3010
01:54:36,109 --> 01:54:39,949

3011
01:54:37,819 --> 01:54:41,750

3013
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:47,899

3014
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:49,729
like I got you guys caught up on all of

3015
01:54:47,899 --> 01:54:52,009
the stuff I had to remind you of and

3016
01:54:49,729 --> 01:54:53,719
talk about so now I think it's time to

3017
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:57,739
read a couple of news articles that I

3018
01:54:53,720 --> 01:55:00,380
picked out for the day ah this one says

3019
01:54:57,739 --> 01:55:03,139
Colorado seeks federal okay for state

3020
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:05,060
colleges to grow pot a lot of people

3021
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,980
from out of state are going what but

3022
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:08,539
it'll make sense this article is from

3023
01:55:06,979 --> 01:55:11,059
the Denver Post it's written by John

3024
01:55:08,539 --> 01:55:13,489
Ingold it says Colorado has made an

3025
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,620
unusual plea to federal authorities let

3026
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:17,359
our colleges grow pot in a letter sent

3027
01:55:15,619 --> 01:55:19,640
last month the state Attorney General's

3028
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:21,380
Office asks federal health and education

3029
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:23,570
officials for permission on Colorado's

3030
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:25,550
colleges and universities to obtain

3031
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:29,299
marijuana from non federal government

3032
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:30,680
resources for research purposes the

3033
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,570
letter isn't more specific on how the

3034
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:34,850
state's higher education institutions

3035
01:55:32,569 --> 01:55:37,009
might score weed but it was sent

3036
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:39,500
pursuant to a law passed in 2014

3037
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:41,780
requiring state officials to ask that

3038
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:43,789
Colorado colleges and universities be

3039
01:55:41,779 --> 01:55:45,898
allowed to cultivate marijuana and its

3040
01:55:43,789 --> 01:55:47,969
component parts

3041
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:50,039
current research is riddled with bias or

3042
01:55:47,969 --> 01:55:52,288
insufficiencies and often conflict and

3043
01:55:50,038 --> 01:55:53,518
often conflict with one another reads a

3044
01:55:52,288 --> 01:55:56,248
letter written by Deputy Attorney

3045
01:55:53,519 --> 01:55:57,659
General David Blake it is critical that

3046
01:55:56,248 --> 01:55:59,908
we be allowed to fill the void of

3047
01:55:57,658 --> 01:56:00,988
scientific research and this may only be

3048
01:55:59,908 --> 01:56:04,049
done with your assistance and

3049
01:56:00,988 --> 01:56:05,938
cooperation on the request is Lana not a

3050
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:07,979
longshot while marijuana is with

3051
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:09,809
qualifications legal in Colorado it

3052
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:11,458
remains illegal under federal law and

3053
01:56:09,809 --> 01:56:13,949
getting permission to conduct research

3054
01:56:11,458 --> 01:56:16,288
on cannabis requires clearing a set of

3055
01:56:13,948 --> 01:56:18,268
high hurdles approval from multiple

3056
01:56:16,288 --> 01:56:19,800
federal agencies and strict requirements

3057
01:56:18,269 --> 01:56:22,289
on how marijuana must be handled and

3058
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,699
stored researchers that work without the

3059
01:56:22,288 --> 01:56:26,069
federal government's blessing risk

3060
01:56:23,698 --> 01:56:28,378
losing crucial federal funding for their

3061
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:29,960
institutions not to mention possible in

3062
01:56:28,378 --> 01:56:32,239
prison

3063
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:34,819
an intern an international treaty that

3064
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:37,250
the United States sign in/sign D signed

3065
01:56:34,819 --> 01:56:38,840
on to sorry I'm stumbling um hi signed

3066
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:40,430
on to requires the federal government to

3067
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:42,199
designate only one place in the country

3068
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:45,230
that can legally grow marijuana for

3069
01:56:42,199 --> 01:56:47,630
research since 1968 that place has been

3070
01:56:45,229 --> 01:56:50,059
the University of Mississippi's national

3071
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:52,250
care for natural products research which

3072
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:55,100
cultivates cannabis on a 12 acre plot

3073
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:57,350
and sends it to approved researchers as

3074
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:59,810
that a 12 acre plot is rumoured to be

3075
01:56:57,350 --> 01:57:01,910
where the g13 came from many years ago

3076
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:03,020
out of a University of Mississippi so if

3077
01:57:01,909 --> 01:57:04,840
you know anything about that send me

3078
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:07,400
some info I'd like to know about it

3079
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,350
alright the article goes on to say

3080
01:57:07,399 --> 01:57:11,729
coincidentally the National

3081
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:13,620
the National Institute on Drug Abuse

3082
01:57:11,729 --> 01:57:16,199
recently put the government's pot farm

3083
01:57:13,619 --> 01:57:18,420
contract up for rebid applicants need to

3084
01:57:16,199 --> 01:57:21,329
have 12 acres of secured and video

3085
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:23,369
monitored outdoor space and 1,000 feet

3086
01:57:21,329 --> 01:57:25,949
of indoor space to grow marijuana to be

3087
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:28,349
able to make marijuana extractions test

3088
01:57:25,949 --> 01:57:30,210
for potency and prepare preferably by

3089
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:32,160
hand rolling a small batch of marijuana

3090
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:34,829
cigarettes of according to the official

3091
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:36,899
solicitation the contracts winner is

3092
01:57:34,829 --> 01:57:39,149
expected to be announced in the next

3093
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:40,920
couple of months a spokeswoman for the

3094
01:57:39,149 --> 01:57:42,659
National Institute of drug abuse would

3095
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:44,850
not say how many institutions applied

3096
01:57:42,659 --> 01:57:48,420
for the contract or where they are were

3097
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:50,370
sorry spokesman for the University of

3098
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:53,010
Colorado and Colorado State University

3099
01:57:50,369 --> 01:57:55,409
said their schools did not apply the

3100
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:57,480
Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014

3101
01:57:55,409 --> 01:57:59,279
massively increased the amount of pot

3102
01:57:57,479 --> 01:58:02,519
the government's official supplier can

3103
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:05,519
grow from 21 kilos to six hundred and

3104
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,500
fifty kilos the increase was the result

3105
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,090
of a boom in marijuana research interest

3106
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:11,130
and the University of Mississippi has

3107
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:13,380
pledged to grow new strains of marijuana

3108
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:15,480
to give research more options for their

3109
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:17,310
studies is a long time ago there was a

3110
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:18,479
video out a movie I cannot recall the

3111
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:20,160
name of the movie I mean it was

3112
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:23,279
something like the Union it may have

3113
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:25,559
been in the Union I may have been how

3114
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:26,880
though how we'd won the West maybe I

3115
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,590
can't remember the name of which movie

3116
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,109
it was but they actually showed us

3117
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:33,470
inside of this facility in Mississippi

3118
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:35,429
where they grow this cannabis and it was

3119
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:37,560
terrible

3120
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:39,030
they weren't growing high-grade cannabis

3121
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,340
I [ __ ] about the weed at the

3122
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:42,840
dispensaries and I would rather smoke

3123
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:44,850
the weed at the dispensaries than the

3124
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:47,449
[ __ ] that I saw being grown at

3125
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:50,039
University of Mississippi that stuff was

3126
01:58:47,449 --> 01:58:51,029
terrible so it's not really cool that

3127
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:53,250
they're doing the research with that I

3128
01:58:51,029 --> 01:58:54,989
hope they get I hope since then they've

3129
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:56,250
gotten a real grower and they've gotten

3130
01:58:54,989 --> 01:58:59,099
some genetics and they've learned a few

3131
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:00,630
things is what I saw was [ __ ] all

3132
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,220
continue with article it says still the

3133
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:03,779
Colorado Attorney General's letter says

3134
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,909
the federal government falls short of

3135
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:07,380
being able to supply researchers with

3136
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:09,269
the kinds of products available in

3137
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:11,579
Colorado's commercial America commercial

3138
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:13,440
marijuana market state health officials

3139
01:59:11,579 --> 01:59:15,449
have just approved up to eight point

3140
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:17,399
four million dollars in grants for

3141
01:59:15,449 --> 01:59:20,010
marijuana studies some of which will

3142
01:59:17,399 --> 01:59:22,109
examine Colorado specific products but

3143
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:24,469
the Attorney General's Office says more

3144
01:59:22,109 --> 01:59:26,359
needs to be done we need to support

3145
01:59:24,469 --> 01:59:28,368
but we need the support of our federal

3146
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:30,408
partners to overcome the inertia that

3147
01:59:28,368 --> 01:59:32,029
continues to complicate state state

3148
01:59:30,408 --> 01:59:34,819
efforts in this area at the letter

3149
01:59:32,029 --> 01:59:37,788
states so it seems like they caught on

3150
01:59:34,819 --> 01:59:39,228
they know that we've got the dank here

3151
01:59:37,788 --> 01:59:41,389
in Colorado they need they know that

3152
01:59:39,229 --> 01:59:43,550
they need to contest excuse me they know

3153
01:59:41,389 --> 01:59:45,590
they need to examine Colorado specific

3154
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:46,849
products so maybe they are catching on

3155
01:59:45,590 --> 01:59:48,078
maybe they know that that stuff that

3156
01:59:46,849 --> 01:59:49,729
they're drilling out there that

3157
01:59:48,078 --> 01:59:51,920
University is a bunch of mids

3158
01:59:49,729 --> 01:59:53,630
speaking of mid shout out to my buddy

3159
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,090
bigger lover hope you're doing well bro

3160
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:57,349
so what this says this article talked

3161
01:59:56,090 --> 02:00:01,400
about this a minute we are actually

3162
01:59:57,349 --> 02:00:03,800
asking the federal government to let the

3163
02:00:01,399 --> 02:00:07,219
state of this state colleges or higher

3164
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:10,788
educational centers in Colorado to grow

3165
02:00:07,219 --> 02:00:15,288
cannabis they want to grow pot that

3166
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:17,868
means there will be courses or a class

3167
02:00:15,288 --> 02:00:19,939
that is accredited to a college where

3168
02:00:17,868 --> 02:00:22,248
somebody is growing weed it's probably

3169
02:00:19,939 --> 02:00:24,738
going to be a chemistry class or a

3170
02:00:22,248 --> 02:00:26,210
biology class it probably won't be a

3171
02:00:24,738 --> 02:00:27,768
horticulture class because they're not

3172
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:30,769
worried about growing it they're more

3173
02:00:27,769 --> 02:00:32,510
worried about the effects and science

3174
02:00:30,769 --> 02:00:34,340
and they know how to grow it that's

3175
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:35,809
horticulture that's already done these

3176
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:38,779
guys are gonna probably have some

3177
02:00:35,809 --> 02:00:42,260
students doing making extracts testing

3178
02:00:38,779 --> 02:00:43,340
the extracts I'm not even sure what

3179
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:44,989
they're gonna do but I'm impressed and

3180
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:47,900
I'm excited I hope this works because I

3181
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:49,728
would love to see cannabis grown in a

3182
02:00:47,899 --> 02:00:52,219
university and tested here in Colorado

3183
02:00:49,729 --> 02:00:54,400
where we're not scared and trying to lie

3184
02:00:52,219 --> 02:00:57,139
about all of the results and to see

3185
02:00:54,399 --> 02:01:00,078
possibly some of my friends that are

3186
02:00:57,139 --> 02:01:02,150
college students able to study cannabis

3187
02:01:00,078 --> 02:01:03,920
in this way in a college and actually

3188
02:01:02,149 --> 02:01:05,839
get college credit and build a future

3189
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,940
for themselves I really like this I

3190
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:11,150
really love that cannabis has kind of

3191
02:01:07,939 --> 02:01:13,069
opened doors and gone from us hiding to

3192
02:01:11,149 --> 02:01:15,228
letting us kind of make a living for

3193
02:01:13,069 --> 02:01:18,498
ourselves this demographic this age

3194
02:01:15,229 --> 02:01:19,670
group of 25 to 40 year old males and

3195

3235
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:43,659
says hey cannabis why would someone name

3236
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:46,448
a strain of weed after a bio weapon that

3237
02:02:43,658 --> 02:02:50,349
killed thousands of people and they

3238
02:02:46,448 --> 02:02:51,698
signed the letter put off pot so this

3239
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:54,010
guy's asking why would somebody name a

3240
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:55,329
strain a weed after a bio weapon to kill

3241
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:57,760
thousands of people and the cannabis

3242
02:02:55,329 --> 02:02:59,829
replies you must be talking about Agent

3243
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,869
Orange huh I hear your concern strain

3244
02:02:59,829 --> 02:03:03,819
names can mean one thing to a potential

3245
02:03:01,869 --> 02:03:05,948
customer and something else to a plant

3246
02:03:03,819 --> 02:03:07,750
breeder naming the strain while Agent

3247
02:03:05,948 --> 02:03:09,939
Orange is not a peaceful happy or your

3248
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:12,279
phoric name if you view it in historical

3249
02:03:09,939 --> 02:03:14,259
context there is the other view that the

3250
02:03:12,279 --> 02:03:17,769
name suggests an orange scent and the

3251
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:20,320
potency is the bomb the article says I

3252
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:21,699
chatted with Adam Dunn host of the Adam

3253
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:22,840
Dunn show shout out to the Adam Dunn

3254
02:03:21,698 --> 02:03:24,519
show what's up Mitch what's up Adam

3255
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,110
what's up everybody on the show crunch

3256
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:28,179
each bike you guys are all doing well

3257
02:03:26,109 --> 02:03:30,399
but Adam is the founder of the

3258
02:03:28,179 --> 02:03:32,408
amsterdam-based seed company th seeds

3259
02:03:30,399 --> 02:03:34,960
and he says having owned a seed company

3260
02:03:32,408 --> 02:03:36,579
myself for 21 years I can attest that

3261
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,039
many cannabis seed companies are run by

3262
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:41,050
people who have a bit more of a juvenile

3263
02:03:39,039 --> 02:03:43,869
attitude especially when it comes to

3264
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:45,279
name - the names game Dunn says names

3265
02:03:43,869 --> 02:03:48,219
like Agent Orange

3266
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:50,500
47 Green crack and wheelchair weed

3267
02:03:48,219 --> 02:03:52,300
though quite distasteful conjure up

3268
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:54,488
images of something really strong and

3269
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,260
devastating I doubt the people who named

3270
02:03:54,488 --> 02:03:57,848
Agent Orange really considered this was

3271
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,989
a bio weapon that killed thousands of

3272
02:03:57,849 --> 02:04:01,659
people and destroyed lives have

3273
02:03:58,988 --> 02:04:04,598
countless more often stray names are

3274
02:04:01,658 --> 02:04:06,339
creative often strange or creative

3275
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:08,380
combinations of the names that make up

3276
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:10,869
the genetic lineage or other plant

3277
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:13,000
attributes annum Dunn says having been

3278
02:04:10,868 --> 02:04:15,759
there at the naming of ak-47 and my own

3279
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,599
MKULTRA I am guilty of joining the hype

3280
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:22,690
Dunn says I was dead wrong back in 1993

3281
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:25,469
when I said ak-47 was a terrible name it

3282
02:04:22,689 --> 02:04:27,669
was named for flowering on 47 days an

3283
02:04:25,469 --> 02:04:30,730
ak-47 went on to become one of the most

3284
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:32,590
famous strains and history at the start

3285
02:04:30,729 --> 02:04:34,689
of the legal adult use market this year

3286
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:36,250
the reactions of consumers to strain

3287
02:04:34,689 --> 02:04:39,368
names is a recent development in

3288
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:41,710
marijuana marketing Dunn points out Dunn

3289
02:04:39,368 --> 02:04:43,479
points out that the cannabis industry is

3290
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:47,590
very young and will go through many

3291
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:48,968
changes so I am guilty of this this is

3292
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:51,909
why it got me attention I've got a

3293
02:04:48,969 --> 02:04:53,230
string called Bounty Killer and I had a

3294
02:04:51,908 --> 02:04:54,488
friend named Nancy tell me that she

3295
02:04:53,229 --> 02:04:56,049
didn't really like the name and she was

3296
02:04:54,488 --> 02:04:58,718
reluctant to grow it because it was

3297
02:04:56,050 --> 02:05:01,119
called Bounty Killer I called it Bounty

3298
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:02,139
Killer honestly it's named after one of

3299
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:05,979
my favorite reggae artist his name

3300
02:05:02,139 --> 02:05:07,270
Bounty Killer uh he I like the way he

3301
02:05:05,979 --> 02:05:09,098
does things and I wanted to kind of

3302
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:10,840
honor him I've got the Capleton which is

3303
02:05:09,099 --> 02:05:13,119
also named after a reggae artist and

3304
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:15,190
I've got the Kalonji Kush which is also

3305
02:05:13,118 --> 02:05:17,578
named after a reggae artist and the

3306
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:20,078
night nurse is named after a reggae song

3307
02:05:17,578 --> 02:05:22,058
so the reason I called Bounty Killer

3308
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:24,219
Bounty Killer after the reggae artist is

3309
02:05:22,059 --> 02:05:26,320
because it grows killer weed it is

3310
02:05:24,219 --> 02:05:28,809
killer it'll kick your ass and it grows

3311
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:30,729
huge colas and huge harvests so that's

3312
02:05:28,809 --> 02:05:32,409
the bounty there and it's the Bounty

3313
02:05:30,729 --> 02:05:33,908
Killer so if you don't know about reggae

3314
02:05:32,408 --> 02:05:36,670
it sounds like you're reaping the bounty

3315
02:05:33,908 --> 02:05:37,988
you're killing that huge harvest or if

3316
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:39,639
you know reggae you know that it's the

3317
02:05:37,988 --> 02:05:41,828
Bounty Killer and it's kind of

3318
02:05:39,639 --> 02:05:43,300
aggressive and kind of loud and it's got

3319
02:05:41,828 --> 02:05:45,340
a groovy beat to it that's why I call it

3320
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:47,380
the Bounty Killer I wanted to talk about

3321
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:49,360
why I named sting things the way I named

3322
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:50,730
them and why strains I've treated have

3323
02:05:49,359 --> 02:05:53,359
the names they have

3324
02:05:50,729 --> 02:05:56,129
I'm a Grateful Dead fan I'm a Deadhead

3325
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:57,659
I'm kind of a and it like the whole

3326
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:59,310
spiritual side of life I'm definitely a

3327
02:05:57,659 --> 02:06:02,670
Rastafarian that's why my company is

3328
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:05,280
called IRA genetics I try to honor the

3329
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:07,680
parents the parent plants that I'm using

3330
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:09,479
when I create a new strain but sometimes

3331
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:13,140
that just gets redundant and you can't

3332
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:16,139
be creative so I like to draw from Rasta

3333
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:18,150
culture Grateful Dead culture and like

3334
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,410
positive loving hippie culture that's

3335
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:22,049
why I've got a string called heart of

3336
02:06:19,409 --> 02:06:24,090
gold it's the golden goat cross to the

3337
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:26,520
Grateful dog it almost got called horn

3338
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:29,220
dog but that didn't sound as good for

3339
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:30,840
the vibe I'm trying to promote a heart

3340
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:32,940
of gold when he smoked that weed and you

3341
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:34,890
meditate your heart is calm your heart

3342
02:06:32,939 --> 02:06:36,329
is filled with love well it's better

3343
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:37,739
than a heart of gold right you got a big

3344
02:06:36,329 --> 02:06:40,319
heart of gold that's just pump and love

3345
02:06:37,738 --> 02:06:41,909
and positive energy and it's got golden

3346
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:46,170
goat in it so it's heart of gold

3347
02:06:41,909 --> 02:06:47,639
lemon Geoffrey is golden goat crossed to

3348
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:50,159
the lemon skunk

3349
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:53,369
so there's lemon obviously the lemon

3350
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:56,220
right and my name is Geoff and I wanted

3351
02:06:53,369 --> 02:06:58,079
something like you got Orient haze and

3352
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:59,760
there's Neville's haze why not have a

3353
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:01,380
lemon Geoffrey that's named after me the

3354
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,300
guy that made it that was kind of my

3355
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:06,380
little stingy move on the kiss world

3356
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:08,550
there these guys were talking about

3357
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:10,230
Agent Orange that was so cool it's

3358
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:12,900
orange velvet it's an orange velvet to

3359
02:07:10,229 --> 02:07:14,459
Jack the Ripper cross and I think Agent

3360
02:07:12,899 --> 02:07:16,139
Orange is a perfect name then I just did

3361
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:18,210
another name Jack the Ripper

3362
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:20,250
it's Jack Herer crossed to other stuff

3363
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:22,409
basically and sub-cooled didn't want to

3364
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:24,569
use the name Jack Herer so it's Jack the

3365
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:27,720
Ripper just that's how these names come

3366
02:07:24,569 --> 02:07:29,939
up I've got a strain that I wanted to

3367
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:31,739
call it the Golden Road it's a golden go

3368
02:07:29,939 --> 02:07:34,769
across and of course that's a Grateful

3369
02:07:31,738 --> 02:07:38,579
Dead song so my names come from trying

3370
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:40,200
to honor the parents trains and so I did

3371
02:07:38,579 --> 02:07:41,729
get creative I crime gonna say this name

3372
02:07:40,199 --> 02:07:44,429
here on the show that it's not out yet

3373
02:07:41,729 --> 02:07:47,339
but I've this is my cross ah

3374
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:50,100
gorilla glue number four crossed to the

3375
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:51,659
Grateful dog is called griptape and

3376
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:52,650
that's for my skateboard friends you

3377
02:07:51,659 --> 02:07:53,699
know what grip tape is on your

3378
02:07:52,649 --> 02:07:54,750
skateboard it's that [ __ ] that makes

3379
02:07:53,699 --> 02:07:55,019
your feet stick to the board a little

3380
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:58,109
bit

3381
02:07:55,020 --> 02:08:00,690
I call it drip tape because it is sticky

3382
02:07:58,109 --> 02:08:02,519
it would be called fly paper but fly

3383
02:08:00,689 --> 02:08:04,199
paper has already taken and grip tape

3384
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:05,460
kind of honors my skateboard friends

3385
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:07,439
so that's where the names come from

3386
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:09,510
we're not just spouting out random [ __ ]

3387
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:11,250
some guys are

3388
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:12,510
one of my best sellers lately has

3389
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:14,189
actually been a strain that's called

3390
02:08:12,510 --> 02:08:15,570
Blue Heeler that was named by our good

3391
02:08:14,189 --> 02:08:18,059
buddy Spence from the garden of Weeden

3392
02:08:15,569 --> 02:08:20,130
it's actually blue dream cross to the

3393
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:23,310
Grateful dog so grateful dog gives you a

3394
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:25,109
dog named the blue blue heeler it's

3395
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:27,030
named after a dog to keep the Grateful

3396
02:08:25,109 --> 02:08:28,769
dog reference and it's also got the word

3397
02:08:27,029 --> 02:08:31,590
healer in there because it's gonna make

3398
02:08:28,770 --> 02:08:32,850
you feel better so it's just me trying

3399
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:34,739
to be silly and trying to be creative

3400
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:36,690
and honor the parents and you have to

3401
02:08:34,739 --> 02:08:39,899
name it something you know you can't

3402
02:08:36,689 --> 02:08:41,129
just call it X 5 maybe you can but that

3403
02:08:39,899 --> 02:08:44,009
would be boring right that's not good

3404
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:45,239
marketing all right so that's enough of

3405
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:46,860
that article I just wanted to talk about

3406
02:08:45,239 --> 02:08:49,079
how I named strains and why I named them

3407
02:08:46,859 --> 02:08:50,969
what I named them if you gave me like

3408
02:08:49,079 --> 02:08:52,289
anything that I crossed a ghost oh gee

3409
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:53,400
it's gonna be called ghost whatever I

3410
02:08:52,289 --> 02:08:56,609
crossed it too you know what I mean

3411
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:58,710
ghost dog goes to goat the golden ghost

3412
02:08:56,609 --> 02:09:00,359
you know [ __ ] like that it just oh if I

3413
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:02,550

3415
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:06,720

02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:05,360
a story about Maddie introduce you guys

3595
02:19:06,139 --> 02:19:15,569
so one time Spence made Earl and pyrex

3596
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:16,739
dish that had a little bit of vho left

3597
02:19:15,569 --> 02:19:18,869
in the bottom that we didn't feel like

3598
02:19:16,739 --> 02:19:20,969
scraping out and she decided to heat it

3599
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:23,190
up and make brownies in that pan with

3600
02:19:20,969 --> 02:19:25,679
the BHO mix in there and she's laughing

3601
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:28,739
because Spence and I are on the six-four

3602
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:30,720
six-five level of life close to 200

3603
02:19:28,739 --> 02:19:32,039
pounds each and there was another guy

3604
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:34,590
and another guy in the room that's about

3605
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:37,680
same same weight class and she [ __ ]

3606
02:19:34,590 --> 02:19:39,930
wrecked 4 dudes maybe 5 or 6 dude I

3607
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:43,050
didn't even know that that it was gonna

3608
02:19:39,930 --> 02:19:45,030
be that potent oh my god the whole outer

3609
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:48,899
layer of the brownie was literally

3610
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:51,000
covered in a layer of shatter almost and

3611
02:19:48,899 --> 02:19:54,181
it coated inside of the brownie but it

3612
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:57,931
worked itself in perfectly to where it

3613
02:19:54,181 --> 02:19:59,819
got us all so fun it was like a

3614
02:19:57,931 --> 02:20:01,950
pineapple upside-down cake layer of hash

3615
02:19:59,819 --> 02:20:03,590
on the outside of the brownies illis so

3616
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:05,960
it was tasty but God I was

3617
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:08,000
leave about 30 minutes after I left the

3618
02:20:05,959 --> 02:20:14,829
Irate that [ __ ] I felt my arms drooping

3619
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:19,430
and that was the only way I could really

3620
02:20:14,829 --> 02:20:21,200
utilize a pyrex dish without wasting it

3621
02:20:19,430 --> 02:20:22,720
so you sit back in the Damned and ask a

3622
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:26,359
tech question now what do you do now

3623
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:30,559
definitely do not blast into a pyrex

3624
02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:33,229
dish or use a pyrex dish in our process

3625
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:37,760
anymore at all everything's closed loop

3626
02:20:33,228 --> 02:20:39,739
and use parchment when we process it to

3627
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:41,989
go through the back of it so there's no

3628
02:20:39,739 --> 02:20:43,100
pirate station needed now nice yeah you

3629
02:20:41,989 --> 02:20:44,959
guys stopped me a way to do it there's

3630
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:47,329
no pyrex dish involved in how I was

3631
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:57,199
taught which is kind of neat these guys

3632
02:20:47,329 --> 02:20:58,700
are [ __ ] badass at what they do let's

3633
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:00,350
do a urine review and I thought that

3634
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:02,090
would be kind of cool the one thing that

3635
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:20,359
stood out to me too is you got super

3636

kink in grapes topper G cross and it

3659
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:47,011
looked beautiful yeah I had two

3660
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:49,620
different nose I had four plants all

3661
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:53,761
together to fiy nose of the same thing

3662

really far away totally different color

market I think that might just be

3670
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:16,771
something that the crew around here gets

3671
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:19,500
to grow but you did a good job all right

3672
02:23:16,771 --> 02:23:20,730
so for a year in review both you guys

3673
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,170
are involved in these questions you can

3674
02:23:20,729 --> 02:23:23,939
both have an answer you can take turns

3675
02:23:22,170 --> 02:23:25,319
huh what were some of your favorite

3676
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:26,521
strains to grow since we're all growers

3677
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:27,779
in the room and I might answer on some

3678
02:23:26,521 --> 02:23:34,530
of these questions too and since we'll

3679
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:37,290
do a year interview let's see I think at

3680
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:40,860
the beginning of the stuff on the whole

3681
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:43,021
Girl Scout cookie thing I was kind of

3682
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:44,870
running through I still currently still

3683
02:23:43,021 --> 02:23:49,141
have a lot of different you know just

3684
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:51,120
different unique cookie stuff but I do

3685
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:55,440
that yet EOG and that kind of put me

3686
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:57,721
onto the OG side of you know kind of

3687
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:59,579
trekking and trying to find different

3688
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:01,709
strains like I picked up triangle the

3689
02:23:59,579 --> 02:24:05,069
other day so that's another one to have

3690
02:24:01,709 --> 02:24:10,109
around but I'd probably say yetis are as

3691
02:24:05,069 --> 02:24:12,649
my favorite planet that's one Jessie

3692
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:12,650
found for us

3693
02:24:13,739 --> 02:24:17,799
what am i follow-up questions was gonna

3694
02:24:15,939 --> 02:24:19,870
be do you prefer to grow different stuff

3695
02:24:17,799 --> 02:24:21,489
for oil - if you're gonna smoke it for

3696
02:24:19,870 --> 02:24:22,479
flour do you grow up for yourself do you

3697
02:24:21,489 --> 02:24:25,299
grow a different strain and then grow

3698
02:24:22,478 --> 02:24:28,599
different for Earl um a lot of times oil

3699
02:24:25,299 --> 02:24:30,849
is just depending on what we have

3700
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:32,229
available at the time so if we have

3701
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:35,050
certain strains that we know that are

3702
02:24:32,228 --> 02:24:37,358
better and oil than they are flour will

3703
02:24:35,049 --> 02:24:39,159
make oil and it seem like we have Kanna

3704
02:24:37,359 --> 02:24:42,460
tonic right now which we're gonna you

3705
02:24:39,159 --> 02:24:43,989
know split and do some oil and then some

3706
02:24:42,459 --> 02:24:45,909
like capsules so there's a little bit of

3707
02:24:43,989 --> 02:24:47,920
mix of oh yeah that's why I feel real

3708
02:24:45,909 --> 02:24:49,539
high they also gave me too two of those

3709
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:55,629
hash capsules right before we started

3710
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:56,260
the show why am I getting heavy and then

3711
02:24:55,629 --> 02:24:58,209
you said that

3712
02:24:56,260 --> 02:25:00,520
so Kanna tonic is that the super high

3713
02:24:58,209 --> 02:25:03,519
CBD strain mom it's not a crazy high

3714
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:06,670
it's good ratio so three two one THC or

3715
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:08,979
CBD THC ratio so it's nice and great

3716
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:11,200
medicine great medicine yeah yeah great

3717
02:25:08,978 --> 02:25:12,818
medicine for people are you gonna take

3718
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:14,200
it - do you have a specific patient in

3719
02:25:12,818 --> 02:25:16,478
mind or a type of patient like an

3720
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:18,100
epileptic or someone else or something I

3721
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:20,228
have a couple of people have a couple of

3722
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:21,640
people who are also like cancer patients

3723
02:25:20,228 --> 02:25:23,799
that I want to try to get some stuff -

3724
02:25:21,639 --> 02:25:25,568
and see if you know just it's not gonna

3725
02:25:23,799 --> 02:25:31,449
hurt to give it a try especially when

3726
02:25:25,568 --> 02:25:33,189
it's you know cancer that's cool that

3727
02:25:31,450 --> 02:25:34,659
you guys help people out guys came from

3728
02:25:33,189 --> 02:25:36,340
North Carolina and set up shop in

3729
02:25:34,659 --> 02:25:38,559
Colorado and they give away a lot of

3730
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:39,909
medicine and for people to be able to

3731
02:25:38,559 --> 02:25:40,779
move at it from out of state and do that

3732
02:25:39,909 --> 02:25:42,100
is really cool because there are a lot

3733
02:25:40,780 --> 02:25:45,040
of people that are really stingy with

3734
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:47,050
what they grow with other people and

3735
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,490
show people what we do yeah that's why

3736
02:25:47,049 --> 02:25:50,559
you guys are so well-known cuz you share

3737
02:25:48,489 --> 02:25:53,219
and you're super kind I think why we

3738
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:57,039
moved from North Carolina's because

3739
02:25:53,219 --> 02:25:58,809
North wanted to tell everybody I grew we

3740
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,520
but he was illegal but I was like yo

3741
02:25:58,809 --> 02:26:08,559
come look at this room like I'd crack

3742
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:10,210
the door open there's so many people

3743
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:14,469
that you know like you do the same thing

3744
02:26:10,209 --> 02:26:16,989
so it's like let me see your weed just

3745
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:18,699
you know everything's common I one thing

3746
02:26:16,989 --> 02:26:20,109
I do wish I do wish the barter system

3747
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:22,418
was

3748
02:26:20,109 --> 02:26:24,488
a little bit better because it would

3749
02:26:22,418 --> 02:26:25,658
take money out of the equation yeah if I

3750
02:26:24,488 --> 02:26:38,139
could just go to the restaurant and pay

3751
02:26:25,658 --> 02:26:39,908
for it to grow this we don't know who

3752
02:26:38,139 --> 02:26:42,760
it's from but there was a New York City

3753
02:26:39,908 --> 02:26:46,600
diesel fee no we had and it tastes like

3754
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:48,969
it smells like red wine and we had put

3755
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:50,199
it in this big circle chart all of our

3756
02:26:48,969 --> 02:26:55,418
friends including me would just

3757
02:26:50,199 --> 02:26:57,578
literally stick their faces in it for it

3758
02:26:55,418 --> 02:27:00,369
was insane and then the oil from it was

3759
02:26:57,578 --> 02:27:02,859
even crazier it just had such a potent

3760
02:27:00,369 --> 02:27:05,020
flavor it was almost it mix it with

3761
02:27:02,859 --> 02:27:07,180
something else to kind of dial it down a

3762
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:08,649
little bit then definitely at the end of

3763
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:10,689
the year one of my last favorites is a

3764
02:27:08,648 --> 02:27:12,219
tangerine haze times the white yeah I

3765
02:27:10,689 --> 02:27:14,318
just found out that I have two packages

3766
02:27:12,219 --> 02:27:16,090
of that in my little vault and that [ __ ]

3767
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:17,859
is going to be ran well you're looking

3768
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:18,850
at me like well let's you run it and

3769
02:27:17,859 --> 02:27:21,430
give me clones at the keeper

3770
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:22,779
unfortunately in the middle of a process

3771
02:27:21,430 --> 02:27:25,270
where we didn't know what we were doing

3772
02:27:22,779 --> 02:27:27,578
with our garden or if we were relocating

3773
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:29,379
so I decided not to take clones of it

3774
02:27:27,578 --> 02:27:31,988
which was a huge mistake because I had a

3775
02:27:29,379 --> 02:27:35,560
fee no that was heavier in the white and

3776
02:27:31,988 --> 02:27:39,248
had a really good flavor to it the oil

3777
02:27:35,559 --> 02:27:41,618
of course is amazing tangerine oil

3778
02:27:39,248 --> 02:27:43,869
tastes crazy yeah she gave me a couple

3779
02:27:41,619 --> 02:27:45,248
dabs of this tangerine oil so I'll give

3780
02:27:43,869 --> 02:27:47,140
you I've got to pack two seeds I'll give

3781
02:27:45,248 --> 02:27:48,850
you a pack maybe both of them you run

3782
02:27:47,139 --> 02:27:51,368
them and you find that tangerine Fino

3783
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:53,020
and and then that'll be a good trade

3784
02:27:51,369 --> 02:27:54,850
I'll take a keeper out of that [ __ ] okay

3785
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:55,930
nice tangerine flavored one and then

3786
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:57,970
maybe I'll breed two that tangerine

3787
02:27:55,930 --> 02:27:58,930
flavoured female I'm so glad you said

3788
02:27:57,969 --> 02:28:00,608
that because that was definitely one of

3789
02:27:58,930 --> 02:28:02,828
my favorite strains that's from down

3790
02:28:00,609 --> 02:28:05,470
with dirt seeds shado Riley that's a

3791
02:28:02,828 --> 02:28:06,520
great strain bro good selection usually

3792
02:28:05,469 --> 02:28:09,068
if you breed to the white it either

3793
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:10,869
comes out nothing like you don't get any

3794
02:28:09,068 --> 02:28:13,600
flavor or you get all that dank

3795
02:28:10,869 --> 02:28:16,899
yeah I had one Fino that came out a

3796
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:18,640
really strong white flavor and the

3797
02:28:16,898 --> 02:28:21,128
tangerine was still there but it was

3798
02:28:18,639 --> 02:28:21,818
definitely a back note to it which was

3799
02:28:21,129 --> 02:28:23,800
nice

3800
02:28:21,818 --> 02:28:25,719
whatever you were giving me dabs of was

3801
02:28:23,799 --> 02:28:29,509
delicious for sure I was like y'all got

3802
02:28:25,719 --> 02:28:32,358
some more of those dabs Felicia

3803
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:34,248
at all inside the good dads go away

3804
02:28:32,359 --> 02:28:37,729
quickly I've been trying to conserve

3805
02:28:34,248 --> 02:28:39,109
what I made and it's hard my dad's all

3806
02:28:37,728 --> 02:28:45,049
day we're gonna take a beer we keep

3807
02:28:39,109 --> 02:28:47,238
saying the D word so many times I've got

3808
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:48,889
a little bit I got from my good friend

3809
02:28:47,238 --> 02:28:56,629
Spence a while back it's the gorilla

3810
02:28:48,889 --> 02:28:59,288
haze imagine the size of parchment that

3811
02:28:56,629 --> 02:29:08,839
it takes to make that sound you guys

3812
02:28:59,289 --> 02:29:09,949
yeah that's a nice piece educated my

3813
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:11,779
next question that I want to talk about

3814
02:29:09,949 --> 02:29:13,100
for the year I might mention a couple of

3815
02:29:11,779 --> 02:29:18,800
strains I don't even want to talk about

3816
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:20,720
my own strains I should but did you

3817
02:29:18,799 --> 02:29:22,129
anything that you there's a few strains

3818
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:28,849
you grew this year that you know that

3819
02:29:22,129 --> 02:29:30,379
white widow was pretty unique there's

3820
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:32,270
some of it over there in a jar curing

3821
02:29:30,379 --> 02:29:33,559
still and I took a bunch of that to the

3822
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:35,220
string cheese show so what I would light

3823
02:29:33,559 --> 02:29:41,978
it the people around me would be like

3824
02:29:35,219 --> 02:29:44,538
[Music]

3825
02:29:41,978 --> 02:29:46,158
again I took cuts to grow it again a

3826
02:29:44,539 --> 02:29:47,479
couple more times cuz I definitely want

3827
02:29:46,158 --> 02:29:49,368
to put it in a bigger pot to give it

3828
02:29:47,478 --> 02:29:51,799
more love more training more nitrogen

3829
02:29:49,369 --> 02:29:55,130

the [ __ ] out of that like yeah it's

3831
02:29:55,129 --> 02:29:58,158
hungry it wants a little bit of

3832
02:29:56,539 --> 02:29:59,270
everything just over feed it if you

3833
02:29:58,158 --> 02:30:01,340

should be okay I'm gonna take a dab

3836
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:06,889
somebody's got to say something so I'll

3837
02:30:04,369 --> 02:30:09,050
ask a question what are some of your

3838
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:10,368
biggest growing evolutions and one of my

3839
02:30:09,049 --> 02:30:12,078
favorites is lemon Jeffrey the white

3840
02:30:10,369 --> 02:30:13,670
widow and the Gorilla Glue I guess will

3841
02:30:12,078 --> 02:30:15,949
settle on those and the Yeti of course

3842
02:30:13,670 --> 02:30:18,170
what are some of your favorite a biggest

3843
02:30:15,949 --> 02:30:19,489
growing evolutions that you guys made at

3844
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:20,389
the garden of Weeden this year and I

3845
02:30:19,488 --> 02:30:21,498
kind of know what you're gonna say and

3846
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:28,818
I'm gonna give a shout out to somebody

3847
02:30:21,498 --> 02:30:31,309
after you do it the cage thing yeah we

3848
02:30:28,818 --> 02:30:33,139
kind of changed but with you know stuff

3849
02:30:31,309 --> 02:30:34,670
changing and like regulation and laws

3850
02:30:33,139 --> 02:30:36,469
and stuff like that you kind of got a

3851
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:37,271
change with the game so now we're kind

3852
02:30:36,469 --> 02:30:40,149
of

3853
02:30:37,271 --> 02:30:43,239
instead of doing a roomful of multiple

3854
02:30:40,149 --> 02:30:46,779
plants were doing less plants same space

3855
02:30:43,239 --> 02:30:48,190
but just bigger Longer veg plants so we

3856
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:49,900
really get to take care of a lot of you

3857
02:30:48,190 --> 02:31:07,390
know get to spend more time with each

3858
02:30:49,899 --> 02:31:10,449
plant management plan for their grow and

3859
02:31:07,390 --> 02:31:12,699
a lot of people are catching on to what

3860
02:31:10,450 --> 02:31:22,360
they're doing because with the plant now

3861
02:31:12,700 --> 02:32:05,351
we have to do something but the spot to

3862
02:31:22,360 --> 02:32:06,700
the spot some breeding in there I've

3863
02:32:05,351 --> 02:32:08,200
been talking about the light that Jesse

3864
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:11,200
gave me I might not even be able to run

3865
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:13,570
it you guys my grow rooms got like a 7

3866
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:15,159
foot ceiling I grow my plants to usually

3867
02:32:13,569 --> 02:32:16,690
five and a half feet tall and I've been

3868
02:32:15,159 --> 02:32:21,239
told that you got to keep the plants 3

3869
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:21,239
feet from those lights you'll burn them

3870
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:28,360
because there's probably cover strains

3871
02:32:24,851 --> 02:32:30,790
that could go closer than 3 feet but I

3872
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:33,610
just think they it would definitely

3873
02:32:30,790 --> 02:32:35,920
stresses a mouse just too much spectrum

3874
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:39,300
and too much just I mean that does if

3875
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:39,299
you've never been on a design

3876
02:32:40,049 --> 02:32:45,148
they just hired me at the spot there's a

3877
02:33:04,030 --> 02:33:07,229

3912
02:35:36,090 --> 02:35:53,489
great rig but I'm kind of offended by

3913
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:56,310
the way it hit me so we talked about

3914
02:35:53,489 --> 02:35:57,601
growing evolutions I didn't change too

3915
02:35:56,310 --> 02:35:58,920
much I'm learning more about breeding

3916
02:35:57,601 --> 02:36:00,569
and I learned that one of the methods I

3917
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:02,579
try to overdid it and I don't need to

3918
02:36:00,569 --> 02:36:05,101
apply so damn much cuz it [ __ ] up my

3919
02:36:02,579 --> 02:36:06,870
plants I tried to I make my own silver

3920
02:36:05,101 --> 02:36:09,300
thiosulfate and I applied way too many

3921
02:36:06,870 --> 02:36:10,829
applications and I learned that if you

3922
02:36:09,299 --> 02:36:12,239
overdo it it just pisses the plants off

3923
02:36:10,829 --> 02:36:14,310
and you don't get enough pollen and it

3924
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:16,829
sucks so that's what I learned

3925
02:36:14,310 --> 02:36:18,720
that's my growing evolution noticed this

3926
02:36:16,829 --> 02:36:21,360
other thing Green Works who stood out in

3927

3944

3962

[Music]

3971
02:39:28,879 --> 02:40:01,859
so I don't do my own thing all right so

3972
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:03,840
I guess since we're talking about

3973
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:05,100
[ __ ] the talent and stuff that we see

3974
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:06,690
here's a great question after seeing

3975
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:08,610
it's been a full year of legalization

3976
02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:10,530
like a year in five days now since we've

3977
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:13,040
legalized recreational adult use

3978
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:15,210
cannabis in the state of Colorado I

3979
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:19,230
remember the moment that you could buy a

3980
02:40:15,209 --> 02:40:20,459
weed at a store in Colorado but after

3981
02:40:19,229 --> 02:40:23,389
this full year how do you feel about it

3982
02:40:20,459 --> 02:40:25,879
and what have you seen make a difference

3983
02:40:23,389 --> 02:40:31,019
yes you guys are from a whole other

3984
02:40:25,879 --> 02:40:33,089
states it's legal so they have to

3985
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:35,550
regulate it you know and some of the

3986
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:38,760
regulations are shady

3987
02:40:35,549 --> 02:40:43,500
yeah but it's stuff that has to be done

3988
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:45,510
if the whole you know the country wants

3989
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:48,450
to use Colorado or Washington as an

3990
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:51,030
example to go legal across the board

3991
02:40:48,450 --> 02:40:52,590
they're gonna have to be it's gonna have

3992
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:54,630
to be regulated like if it wants to be

3993
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:57,360
everywhere so eventually like it's gonna

3994
02:40:54,629 --> 02:41:01,109
happen it sucks first small people like

3995

4012
02:42:03,329 --> 02:42:09,299
learned a lot from from us and also

4013
02:42:05,909 --> 02:42:12,959
yourself and Instagram it's not only

4014
02:42:09,299 --> 02:42:16,349
social network a great media to learn a

4015
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:18,000
lot your table at the should the new and

4016
02:42:16,350 --> 02:42:19,290
the old house as part of what started me

4017
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,450
thinking about I should do something

4018
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:23,940
because I would go to your place and

4019
02:42:21,450 --> 02:42:25,440
guys it's Vincent Maddie's old place and

4020
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:27,120
the new place but people would fly from

4021
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:28,560
North Carolina and come visit these guys

4022
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,150
and just hang out for the weekend

4023
02:42:28,559 --> 02:42:31,739
and when I would show up to come dab

4024
02:42:30,149 --> 02:42:33,420
them out and kind of maybe give them

4025
02:42:31,739 --> 02:42:35,840
some Irish seeds and a t-shirt and some

4026
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:38,579
stickers for visiting and maybe a hatpin

4027
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:41,670
they would start asking weed questions

4028
02:42:38,579 --> 02:42:43,559
and no [ __ ] ten guys came and nine of

4029
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:45,299
them asked the same exact first three

4030
02:42:43,559 --> 02:42:47,549
questions I was like I should just

4031
02:42:45,299 --> 02:42:49,469
record this somewhere and play it back

4032
02:42:47,549 --> 02:42:52,199
at him like here is my answer like an

4033
02:42:49,469 --> 02:42:54,899
automated weed service or some [ __ ] but

4034
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:56,700
I got good at talking to people at the

4035
02:42:54,899 --> 02:42:58,350
table and talking about growing weed

4036
02:42:56,700 --> 02:43:00,450
like that and so you guys this table

4037
02:42:58,350 --> 02:43:02,130
kind of open this up a little bit George

4038
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:06,329
I know you're here so that's kind of

4039
02:43:02,129 --> 02:43:08,699
silly our table is because we're always

4040
02:43:06,329 --> 02:43:10,469
just taking dabs and talking about

4041
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:12,000
different growing subjects and there's

4042
02:43:10,469 --> 02:43:13,529
always so many different people there

4043
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,870
it's always a different conversation

4044
02:43:13,530 --> 02:43:18,880
there's always something to learn such a

4045
02:43:15,870 --> 02:43:29,079
crazy mix of people black guy

4046
02:43:18,879 --> 02:43:31,619
why at that part of the map and I missed

4047
02:43:29,079 --> 02:43:34,510
figure out where I was aiming for

4048
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:45,930
there's an Asian guy from his Vietnamese

4049
02:43:34,510 --> 02:43:49,450
dude a couple of white dudes when

4050
02:43:45,930 --> 02:43:52,360
there's legal weed why wouldn't you we

4051
02:43:49,450 --> 02:43:57,280
come from a place where you can't have

4052
02:43:52,360 --> 02:44:02,069
more than a gram on you well you get a

4053
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:05,350
citation like if it's under 1/8 or happy

4054
02:44:02,069 --> 02:44:06,728
but if it's more you have the

4055
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:10,689
possibility of going to jail that's

4056
02:44:06,728 --> 02:44:12,609
still that's still real in places I'm so

4057
02:44:10,689 --> 02:44:15,040
free we're going home at the end of the

4058
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:18,550
month and so most nerve-racking because

4059
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:19,810
we can't be ourselves there we're so

4060
02:44:18,549 --> 02:44:25,629
used to Colorado everything's so

4061
02:44:19,809 --> 02:44:28,478
easygoing and free here I'm staying yeah

4062
02:44:25,629 --> 02:44:30,459
yeah that's smart that's smart here I

4063
02:44:28,478 --> 02:44:32,170
forget that we're still supposed to

4064
02:44:30,459 --> 02:44:33,699
people forget that there's an open

4065
02:44:32,170 --> 02:44:34,809
container law that applies to cannabis

4066
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:36,820
here you're supposed to have your weed

4067
02:44:34,809 --> 02:44:39,100
in a container that's sealed up and out

4068
02:44:36,819 --> 02:44:39,850
of your reach like in probably supposed

4069
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:41,860
to be in the trunk

4070
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:43,750
honestly I put mine I've got an SUV so

4071
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:45,460
my trunk I can reach the trunk in my car

4072
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:47,459
I can reach everything I'm [ __ ] 65

4073
02:44:45,459 --> 02:44:50,469
and have an SUV

4074
02:44:47,459 --> 02:44:52,089

4075
02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:54,219
I put it in the backpack in a container

4076
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:57,250
and my dad's are always out of reach and

4077
02:44:54,219 --> 02:45:07,898
in the backseat I mean that's how I roll

4078
02:44:57,250 --> 02:45:09,850
sometimes there may have been card abs I

4079
02:45:07,898 --> 02:45:11,590
wanted to be a smartass and ask why he

bunch of murder a whole bunch of rape a

4092

the park just getting high yeah yeah

4095
02:46:28,979 --> 02:46:34,949

4096
02:46:32,101 --> 02:46:37,739
it's legal it is it's like the

4097
02:46:34,950 --> 02:46:40,250
no-brainer I just don't understand why

4098
02:46:37,739 --> 02:46:43,021
other states don't follow hear that

4099

for pointless crimes and make some money

4103
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:56,790
off of cannabis taxes because the state

4104
02:46:55,290 --> 02:46:58,261
of Colorado makes a [ __ ] ton I could

4105

sorry I just got deep on you we had to

4127
02:47:53,851 --> 02:47:59,909
go through a lot of hardships this year

4128
02:47:56,280 --> 02:48:02,070
so definitely getting our win first

4129
02:47:59,909 --> 02:48:04,890
secret cut melon was awesome for us

4130
02:48:02,069 --> 02:48:07,770
pulling everything together and getting

4131
02:48:04,890 --> 02:48:09,539
our entry right and perfecting live

4132
02:48:07,771 --> 02:48:12,870
resin or not I don't know if you'd

4133
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:15,450
consider it perfecting but working on we

4134
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:21,021
just got really good part of the

4135
02:48:15,450 --> 02:48:21,021
pioneering process of trying to perfect

4136
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:33,721
we were with all of our friends and it

4137
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:36,420
was an awesome competition it's pretty

4138
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:37,920
fair in my opinion because you have fur

4139
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:44,370
if anybody doesn't know you have a box

4140
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:46,110
with I think there were 32 maybe 30 you

4141
02:48:44,370 --> 02:48:50,521
get to compete with especially Colorado

4142
02:48:46,110 --> 02:48:54,210
Colorado's like the first place to do

4143
02:48:50,521 --> 02:48:55,561
weed stuff yeah so like now you got it's

4144
02:48:54,209 --> 02:48:57,270
supposed to be like the mecca of oil

4145

4181

winning on Thursday top-shelf Thursday

4188
02:51:45,469 --> 02:51:49,679
there's multiple social clubs in Denver

4189
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:51,238
too so if you're ever bored and you want

4190
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:55,488
to go smoke somewhere just drive a

4191
02:51:51,238 --> 02:51:55,488
Denver and Google social smoke Club

4192
02:51:57,949 --> 02:52:06,510
7:10 social lounge okay but you can pay

4193
02:52:04,049 --> 02:52:12,389
like a member price they pay like 25

4194
02:52:06,510 --> 02:52:15,568
bucks and you can go in there for last

4195
02:52:12,389 --> 02:52:19,680
month they did last time they did a 16

4196
02:52:15,568 --> 02:52:26,068
person bracket just all the way down to

4197
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:32,550
the finals and I won the finals now it's

4198
02:52:26,068 --> 02:52:38,478
32 people so it's a bigger bracket focus

4199
02:52:32,549 --> 02:52:40,889
more focus on making sure my tweets

4200
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:41,248
where it should be at before I even make

4201
02:52:40,889 --> 02:52:42,748
oil

4202
02:52:41,248 --> 02:52:44,340
see that's why I wasn't even making oil

4203
02:52:42,748 --> 02:52:46,020
before I wanted to breed and make sure

4204
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:53,010

4205

4206
02:52:53,010 --> 02:52:56,728
thing with all these competitions this

4207
02:52:54,359 --> 02:53:00,930
year also we met a lot of amazing people

4208
02:52:56,728 --> 02:53:02,129
in Denver specifically because we used

4209
02:53:00,930 --> 02:53:04,168
to go to Denver we used to not really

4210
02:53:02,129 --> 02:53:05,879
know that many people and then we

4211
02:53:04,168 --> 02:53:07,469
started going to the social club we kind

4212
02:53:05,879 --> 02:53:09,839
of connected with a lot other people so

4213
02:53:07,469 --> 02:53:11,788
if you are new to Colorado that's a good

4214
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:14,328
opportunity to meet a lot of other

4215
02:53:11,789 --> 02:53:17,220
fellow divers even if you're just

4216
02:53:14,328 --> 02:53:19,978

4218
02:53:19,978 --> 02:53:27,448
other people for sure find it like the

4219
02:53:25,020 --> 02:53:28,918
cannabis cup for sure I don't really rep

4220
02:53:27,449 --> 02:53:30,539
the high times events but I'll be there

4221

4223
02:53:35,908 --> 02:53:39,389
dope-ass events planned out I'll be

4224
02:53:37,709 --> 02:53:40,649
there I will not have a booth I was

4225
02:53:39,389 --> 02:53:42,778
offered a booth I declined

4226
02:53:40,648 --> 02:53:44,578
I'd rather roam around and do a task

4227
02:53:42,779 --> 02:53:45,630
rock style just take my backpack and do

4228
02:53:44,578 --> 02:53:48,809
what I can

4229
02:53:45,629 --> 02:53:50,488
ah yeah it'll go quickly I'm sure it's

4230
02:53:48,809 --> 02:53:51,930
more fun that way I don't feel tied down

4231
02:53:50,488 --> 02:53:54,029
when I have a booth I can walk around

4232
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:57,350
and go see who I want to and then get

4233
02:53:54,029 --> 02:53:59,609
the [ __ ] out when I'm ready and then

4234
02:53:57,350 --> 02:54:00,809
I'll get a booth in a couple years I'm

4235
02:53:59,609 --> 02:54:02,668
just not ready for that I don't want to

4236
02:54:00,809 --> 02:54:04,288
invest into that and be tied down I need

4237
02:54:02,668 --> 02:54:06,029
to have some employees that will run the

4238
02:54:04,289 --> 02:54:08,069
booth the whole time for me that's what

4239
02:54:06,029 --> 02:54:08,870
I want before I measure yeah I'm not

4240
02:54:08,068 --> 02:54:10,340
ready for that

4241
02:54:08,870 --> 02:54:12,229
so if you're looking forward to me

4242
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:14,030
having a booth at the cup I apologize

4243
02:54:12,228 --> 02:54:15,679
but I'm really tall and really white I

4244
02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:19,450

because I'm nice so this is just random

4281
02:56:58,750 --> 02:57:02,739
side talk when we're talking about

4282
02:57:00,219 --> 02:57:04,930
strains a lot of times people and I

4283
02:57:02,739 --> 02:57:06,399
tried to avoid it also but so many

4284
02:57:04,931 --> 02:57:09,700
people said it that I got sucked into it

4285
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:12,789
a lot of people will say the [ __ ] the

4286
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:15,610
length of times the grateful dog and I

4287
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:17,561
like to say crossed too but so what do

4288
02:57:15,610 --> 02:57:19,239
you guys think tweet me that I grow

4289
02:57:17,560 --> 02:57:25,000
culture which I wish I could change that

4290
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:26,979
but I can't think about it we'll see

4291
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:29,760
what we can do just make a new one and

4292
02:57:26,979 --> 02:57:34,329
then add the link to that one in that I

4293
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:35,920
might have to do new Twitter but tell me

4294
02:57:34,329 --> 02:57:37,450
what you think how should we say that is

4295
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:45,569
that what does that X mean because it's

4296
02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:48,400
not math it doesn't mean x times two

4297
02:57:45,569 --> 02:57:50,260
would make the four you know if you'd

4298
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:52,779
have to bone two it would have four was

4299
02:57:50,260 --> 02:57:55,149
what would come out it's all still

4300
02:57:52,780 --> 02:57:56,771
though I just don't I mean technically

4301
02:57:55,149 --> 02:57:58,600
could be right me personally I just

4425
03:04:52,309 --> 03:04:55,548
a party I'd kind of rather reserve your

4426
03:04:54,318 --> 03:04:57,738
knowledge for when it's just you and I

4427
