00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,679
smoking

27
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,478

full spectrum extract from green dot

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,839
labs this is a blend of

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,000
gmo and legend og on the package the

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,640
flavor is described as dark roast

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,519
garlic and fuel i think there is also a

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
hint of bar

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,759
trash can in here which may sound

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
disgusting but i honestly

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,680
love this gross funky aroma that comes

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
from the fat zone

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
there is definitely a dark roast aroma

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
there's a garlic there's a fuel

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
but then there is also i keep saying it

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
a hint of funky

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
bar trash can and i really can't get

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,239

pioneer

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,239

bunch of my stuff so

122
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
we collabed subcool and i talked about

123
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
collabing quite often

124
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
but he always had so much going on and

125
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
we were so far away

126
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
and i always had a lot going on so we

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
never did it and i

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,438
took the liberty of crossing his jack

129
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
the ripper i found a jack the ripper

130

to make it nice and easy for all of my

204
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,918
stoner friends all right i'm looking at

205
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,279
my notes to see where we are

206
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,279
next i feel like i've caught up on all

207
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,359
the business that was the business

208
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,478
that part's been handled let's talk

209
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
about the main

210
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,279
topic of today's podcast

211
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,639
i keep saying a bunch of [ __ ] on the

212
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,638
internet you guys

213
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,038
people think that they can identify the

214
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,478
sex of a seed by looking at the seed

215
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
people think that they've got gorilla

216
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
glue four seeds let's talk about some

217
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,079
[ __ ] that i keep

218
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,839
reading on the internet one of my

219
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,680
favorite things that i've been seeing

220
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,159
and this is a long old school myth and

221
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,959
i'm here to dispel today

222
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
if you plant your cannabis plants near

223
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,638
blueberries

224
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,239
or near strawberries i don't think

225
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
that's going to make your plants taste

226
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
like [ __ ] blueberries or strawberries

227
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,598
that is not the trick to get blueberry

228
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,478
or strawberry flavored or scented

229
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,319
cannabis

230
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,399
that is genetics that is bread

231
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,439
selectively bred into the cannabis we

232
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,959
find a strain that tastes like

233
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,560
strawberries a little bit

234
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,000
we breed that to something else we find

235
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
a phenotype that tastes a little bit

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759
more strawberry than last time

237
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
then we use that plant and possibly the

238
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
old strawberry phenotype and breed that

239
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,279
and we get rid of all of the phenotypes

240
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
that aren't even more strawberry so we

241
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,079
breed

242
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,519
that flavor in or maybe we're breeding

243
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,959
it out we're bringing it out

244
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,198
and breeding that for you to have your

245
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,038
strawberry or blueblair blueberry

246
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,038
flavored cannabis you say that 10 times

247
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,680
fast you'll [ __ ] it up too it's okay

248
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,079
so the rumor that you can make your herb

249
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
taste

250
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,359
like strawberries or blueberries or

251
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,279
apples by growing it

252
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
near strawberries blueberries or apples

253
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,598
is very unlikely

254
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,038
it may get a hint of it maybe possibly

255
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,918
but i don't think it's going to make it

256
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,318
have that

257
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,918
bold blueberry strawberry aroma flavor

258
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
that people want it to have

259
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,918
also i don't think feeding your plants

260
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,758
like juices and [ __ ] are going to have

261
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,359
the same effect you're not going to get

262
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,879
if you feed your plants blueberry juice

263
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,120
you're not going to get blueberry

264
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,039
flavored buds that's not a real thing

265
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,519
and here is some evidence to support

266
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,759
that

267
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,918
a lot of us feed our plants a lot of

268
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,479
really funky flavored and smelling

269
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,038
things

270
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,800
people that are running uh the k f the

271
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,478
korean natural farming doing the

272
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
fermented fruit juices that stuff

273
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,800
doesn't smell like berries and bubble

274
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
gum

275
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
but when they grow their herb it smells

276
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,639
like berries and bubble gum

277
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
a lot of people put bat [ __ ] cow [ __ ]

278
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
horse [ __ ] chicken [ __ ]

279
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
into their herb it doesn't smell and

280
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,800
taste like bat [ __ ] cow [ __ ]

281
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,599
goat [ __ ] or chicken [ __ ] so the rumor

282
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,439
the idea

283
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
the myth that cannabis will taste like

284
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
berries should you plant it near berries

285
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,879
has just been debunked quit saying that

286
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
[ __ ]

287
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,559
all right the next one i want to debunk

288
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,399
today is that you can

289
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,039
judge the ripeness of your cannabis

290
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
plants by the pistols

291
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,958
i hear people i see people on social

292
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
media say you can tell if your plant is

293
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,000
done by the hairs

294
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,079
first of all if you're saying hairs

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,720
you're already off on the wrong foot

296
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,639
those are pistols also those pistols do

297
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
not indicate ripeness of your cannabis

298
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,799
plants in

299
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,959
any way those are the sex glands of

300
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,838
your female plant those are there to

301
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,599
pick up pollen

302
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
they're flapping in the wind the pollen

303
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
lands on that slides down that

304
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
ends up in the ovule then a seed forms

305
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,439
inside of there

306
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,039
that has nothing to do we're not smoking

307
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,240
pistols are we you don't look at the

308
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,120
pistols and go those are great for

309
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
smoking

310
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,159
we are smoking trichomes why not measure

311
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,239
the

312
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,919
ripeness of our plant by the thing we

313
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
are going to consume the part that

314
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,958
contains the active ingredient

315
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,278
that we want to consume we want thc

316
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,799
why not judge the trichomes by the

317
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:43,439
amount of thc the ripeness of the thc

318
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,240
in my opinion judging your plant's

319
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
ripeness

320
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,320
by the pistols or the hairs is like

321
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,240
judging the ripeness of an apple

322
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
by looking at the dirt underneath the

323
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,639
tree it does not do you

324
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
a bit of [ __ ] good so you cannot

325
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,240
determine the ripeness of your cannabis

326
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
plants by looking at the pistols

327
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
the pistols will change colors if they

328
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,159
get sprayed with something the pistols

329
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,399
will change colors if they get too dry

330
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
the pistols can change brown and wither

331
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,919
up if they get pollinated the pistols

332
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,639
will wither up and dry if you touch them

333
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,559
too much

334
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,559
maybe an insect damaged them maybe they

335
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,278
got too much sun exposure

336
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,399
maybe maybe that plant has passed its

337
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,399
pollination point

338
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,639
and it is no longer able to receive

339
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,078
pollen those plants only want pollen up

340
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,958
till about day 40

341
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,679
but we flower them until about day 65 or

342
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,119
70.

343
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,958
so judging by those pistols is a failure

344
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
to begin with stop doing that

345
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,319
you're [ __ ] up all right i'm going

346
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
really fast but

347
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
i'm kind of just trying out this new

348
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,879
gear i want to keep moving because what

349
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
if this doesn't sound really good and i

350
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,278
record a really long podcast

351
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,838
so i'm going to move on to the next

352
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,320
mother [ __ ] rumor i would like to

353
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
dispel today on this episode i'm moving

354
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,200
to another page i've got a couple that

355
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,039
i'm trying to save here because i'm

356
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
doing them in a certain order uh you

357
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,519
cannot

358
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,958
can not not cannot impossible

359
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,078
to visually identify the sex

360
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:09,278
of a cannabis seed by looking at

361
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,439
that seed if that were possible

362
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,439
i would pay you to come sort out all of

363
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
the male and female seeds from my seed

364
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
batches

365
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,838
i would keep the males so i could grow

366
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
nothing but elite males for myself and

367
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
have killer breeding projects

368
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
then we would sell all of the female

369
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,759
seeds i can guarantee you they were

370
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,838
females

371
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,278
female seeds cost twice as much as

372
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
non-female seeds

373
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,039
non-feminized seeds so if you could do

374
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
that magic trick for me

375
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,199
i would hire you unfortunately that

376
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,879
little chart that you see on social

377
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
media that says if it's got this shape

378
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,078
to it

379
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
or this pointy tip here this volcano

380
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,000
shape here or an acorn shaped here

381
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,879
that is complete and total mother

382
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
[ __ ] [ __ ] debunked roster jeff

383
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,639
calls [ __ ]

384
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,759
if you can do it if you can prove it

385
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
come to my spot

386
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,078
i will give you a hundred seeds i will

387
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,359
let you number them we will label them

388
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,759
we will plant them

389
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
one through one hundred we will veg them

390
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,240
until they're

391
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,278
two inches tall is that two inches i

392
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
don't know we'll veg them until they're

393
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,240
three and a half inches tall that's how

394
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,278
tall gi joe is three and three quarters

395
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,360
that's this tall

396
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,639
judge them tillers tall veg them tillers

397
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,919
tall as gi joe

398
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
then we'll be we're we're going to

399
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,000
flower them we're going to remember

400
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,039
everyone you marked male and female

401
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
we're going to write it down on the

402
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,919
container in which that seed is in we're

403
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,120
going to know i'm going to have

404
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,278
documentation

405
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
if you're ninety percent right i'll be

406
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,039
[ __ ] amazed if you're seventy percent

407
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
right i might still be impressed

408
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,240
fifty percent is just [ __ ] lucky

409
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
guesses you gotta be more than sixty or

410
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,120
seventy percent

411
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
i doubt you're gonna get it right i have

412
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
never seen anybody accurately do that

413
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,519
i don't [ __ ] believe it one bit if

414
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
you can do it come on over i'll [ __ ]

415
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,639
pay you there's a prize involved

416
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
so you cannot visually identify the sex

417
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,839
of seeds by looking at them people are

418
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,199
gonna say what about feminized seeds

419
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,120
that's [ __ ] cheating i know they're

420
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,560
female seeds because i made them they're

421
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,919
feminized i did that

422
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,518
so what if i [ __ ] with you what if i

423
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,199
give you a bunch of seeds and tell you

424
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,879
to sex them for me and i put some female

425
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,959
seeds in there that i know are femmes

426
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,639
the minute i see you say this one's a

427
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,000
boy you're already wrong so we already

428
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,120
know that your whole [ __ ] theory

429
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,519
is all [ __ ] up so you cannot identify

430
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
seeds by looking at them where are we

431
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,320
what do we want to go with next i've got

432
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,799
two more big ones that i know are going

433
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,839
to let me rant for a couple of seconds

434
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,120
not too far into this podcast let's talk

435
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,959
about this one

436
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,278
uh this one just drives me nuts

437
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,759
professionally as an industry as a

438
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,078
community as a movement we need to

439
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,838
work toward more professionalism and a

440
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,679
way we can do that is by using proper

441
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,760
terminology like i said before

442
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,120
those hairs are called pistols you

443
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,720
already sound more credible more

444
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
educated more advanced if you say

445
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
pistols and quit saying hairs

446
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,560
so let's work on another word that

447
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
drives me [ __ ] crazy and if you don't

448
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,638
care

449
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,000
that's cool i just want to give you a

450
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,560
heads up if you want to sound a little

451
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,159
bit more

452
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,599
educated and be taken a little more

453
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
seriously in the group

454
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
let's talk about the word herme herme

455
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,519
drives me nuts

456
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,319
hermes not a [ __ ] word hermaphrodite

457
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,320
is the word

458
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
if you're gonna say hermie just say herm

459
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
don't put the me on

460
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,278
there on there for some reason it sounds

461
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
very juvenile very elementary school

462
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,480
very playground-ish

463
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
herme i don't know it bothers the [ __ ]

464
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,039
out of me also the word isn't

465
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,838
hermaphrodite

466
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,240
the word is intersex if a plant shows

467
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
male

468
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
and female sex parts that plant carries

469
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,078
intersex traits

470
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
let's wipe the word herme out of our

471
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,559
vocabulary

472
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
no more herme maybe hermaphrodite maybe

473
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,119
herm if you're typing fast

474
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
let's work on intersex this plant shows

475
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
intersex traits

476
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,000
it didn't go herm on you it showed

477
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,519
intersex traits

478
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,198
now another thing i want to address that

479
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
falls right into this category

480
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,120
maybe a sub-note of this category i see

481
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,079
people saying

482
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,839
that they put there was a male plant

483
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,359
near their plants

484
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
and it made their females turn

485
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,959
hermaphroditic

486
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,560
and seed up you guys that is not what's

487
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,000
happening let's think about basic

488
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,799
biology

489
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,159
you've got a male plant he's got male

490
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,159
pollen sacs

491
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,198
you've got a female plant she's got what

492
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,078
do we talk about earlier

493
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,599
pistols and ovules now how does nature

494
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,239
work what do boys and girls do

495
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
they [ __ ] how does that happen the

496
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,120
pollen which is basically the sperm

497
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,239
hits the pistol which takes that pistol

498
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
to the ovule

499
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,399
which is where babies are made just like

500
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,879
in nature bro it's sperming up the egg

501
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,559
so those plants that you were saying

502
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,039
that some people on social media keep

503
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,119
saying

504
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,879
my plants were near a male plant and

505
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
they hermed nah bro

506
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,559
they [ __ ] and your plants are pregnant

507
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,759
it's seeded up no herming happened you

508
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,518
let a male go

509
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,759
and that male pollinated that female

510
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,759
plant it wasn't a herm that's nature

511
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,000
that's biology 101.

512
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
they [ __ ] all right i'm going to move

513
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
on from talking about plants [ __ ] i'm

514
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
going to quit saying like that

515
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,759
i'm sure a couple of people threw up in

516
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,799
their mouths every time i said that

517
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,919
let's talk about another thing um

518
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,278
the phrase clone only now

519
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,879
a lot of people don't even understand

520
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,320
what i'm talking about when i say clone

521
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,879
only let's pick the strain

522
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,360
gorilla glue number four gorilla glue

523
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,679
number four is a plant that is a clone

524
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
only gorilla glue 4 was bred by josie

525
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,039
wales rest in peace brother josie wells

526
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
he's no longer with us but his work

527
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,319
lives on forever

528
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,480
gorilla glue 4 is known as number 4

529
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,399
because there was a batch of seeds

530
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,560
number 4 was the prize

531
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,440
seedling out of that batch so he

532
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,039
probably had

533
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,120
i'm going to assume since i've seen

534
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,399
gorilla glue 7 i'm going to assume there

535
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,320
were 10 plants

536
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,078
just guessing hypothetically follow me

537
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
here we've got 10 plants

538
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,958
our friend has named them gorilla glue

539
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
he probably didn't name them until after

540
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,559
he smoked them and smelled

541
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
it either way let's focus on the story

542
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,559
ten seedlings

543
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,000
grew them out he realized number four

544
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,000
and number seven are the [ __ ] keepers

545
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,679
he smokes them i'm assuming and making

546
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,278
this up this is my assumption here

547
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,278
don't don't [ __ ] criticize me too

548
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,000
much but this is how this works

549
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,360
he smokes them he realizes this smells

550
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
or tastes like gorilla glue

551
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
names it gorilla glue but there are 10

552
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,318
seedlings so they all got numbered

553
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
gorilla glue 1 through ten the boys

554
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,599
probably got removed i don't know they

555
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
got put in another room the females got

556
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,119
to flower

557
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,640
there's probably five girls five boys

558
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,078
just hypothetically that's how breeding

559
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,559
and selecting works

560
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,438
of those five there was number four and

561
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,798
number seven

562
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,279
amongst that five hypothetically so

563
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,279
they got their numbers their number

564
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,199
indications because of the specific

565
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,399
phenotype that those plants were from

566
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,240
that cross

567
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,440
so number four gorilla glue number four

568
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,880
is a selected cut which was selected

569
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,400
by josie wales it was named gorilla glue

570
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
and the cut was number four because it

571
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
was probably the fourth plant in the

572
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,159
tray

573
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,600
hence gorilla glue number four

574
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,480
now why is it a clone only because

575
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,240
josie never put out a male plant of the

576
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,440
gorilla glue number four he never

577
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,359
released a male

578
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,798
so it is clone only there are no

579
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,519
unadulterated seeds of gorilla glue

580
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,480
number four

581
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,079
available on the market unless josie put

582
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,798
them out and he did

583
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,678
not and let's talk about that if he did

584
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,359
breed to it

585
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
they wouldn't be gorilla glue number

586
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,678
four seeds they would be

587
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
gorilla glue number four crossed to

588
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,320
something

589
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,759
which would lose the name gorilla glue

590
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,759
number four

591
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,798
so let's talk about this in a couple of

592
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,279
other terms

593
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,119
if he took a gorilla if anybody took a

594
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,519
gorilla glue number four plant and bred

595
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,359
to it you can make seeds but they are

596
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,480
not gorilla glue four they are now

597
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,319
adulterated

598
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,038
gorilla glue four seeds bred to

599
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,079
something it's gorilla glue for ex

600
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,640
other plant cross to another plant the

601
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,000
only

602
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,759
way it is possible to have pure gorilla

603
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,200
glue number four seeds

604
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,359
is to have s1 feminized gorilla glue

605
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,360
number four seeds what that means

606
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,719
is we took a gorilla glue number four

607
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,959
plant the official

608
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,120
clone only plant the selection that

609
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,279
josie whales selected himself

610
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,159
and labeled number four you have to take

611
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,960
that plant

612
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,640
take two clones of that same plant treat

613
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,319
one with the solution there are multiple

614
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
ways to reverse a plant of course i

615
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,480
recommend silver thiosulfate

616
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,880
apply silver thiosulfate to the one

617
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,519
plant it will create pollen sacs

618
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
apply that pollen to the female plant at

619
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,519
the right time

620
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,679
now you have produced gorilla glue

621
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,240
number four

622
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,160
seeds you have self the gorilla glue it

623
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,960
is not adulterated there are no

624
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
other genetics within that cross so the

625
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,079
only

626
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,038
way that you can have gorilla glue

627
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,240
number four

628
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,558
seeds is if they are feminized as ones

629
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
otherwise those seeds people are selling

630
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,558
you giving you trading to you

631
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
offering you are [ __ ] that is not

632
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,798
gorilla glue number four

633
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,759
unless they reversed it and made

634
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,918
feminized

635
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,798
seeds let's talk about this in other

636
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,240
terms that may

637
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,918
make it more clear for other people

638
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,759
let's talk about an animal that is

639
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,320
nearly extinct i'm going to create an

640
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,079
animal

641
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,319
uh we're going to call it the uh the

642
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,199
purple wombat there's only

643
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,558
one female purple wombat left on the

644
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,080
planet just one

645
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,759
how are we gonna make more we're not

646
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,038
because there's only one [ __ ] female

647
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,519
there's no sperm

648
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,200
one purple wombat on the planet it's a

649
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,038
girl where are we gonna get some sperm

650
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,120
from there are no dudes around

651
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,319
we're not we're not going to make more

652
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,399
purple wombats

653
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,519
that is how biology and breeding work

654
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
there is only

655
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,519
one female of gorilla glue number four

656
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
there was never a male released

657
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,079
josie didn't put out the mail you can't

658
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
make more unadulterated crosses without

659
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,079
the mail

660
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,039
so that is my rant on clone only clone

661
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,359
only means

662
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,759
that there was never seeds or a male

663
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,079
release to make seeds with

664
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,599
of course breeders like myself have kind

665
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,519
of [ __ ] this all up and started making

666
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,158
feminized seeds let's talk about golden

667
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,839
goat

668
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
i did not make golden goat i need to

669
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,240
give a shout out to dr

670
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
dank who made the golden goat mr dank dr

671
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
dank

672
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,400
i apologize for getting it wrong on a

673
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,840
podcast big respect either way

674
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
i'm live on the spot trying to keep up

675
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,639
with my own brain mr dank made golden

676
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,960
goat

677
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,919
i acquired the golden goat clone it was

678
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,159
a clone

679
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,960
only there is no male of golden goat

680
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,720
available

681
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,759
this guy put out the clone of golden

682
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,839
goat clone only no seeds no male plant

683
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,558
until i got a hold of it and made that

684
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,158
s1 my purpose for making the s1 is

685
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,918
because people in other places were

686
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
seeing my pictures of golden go

687
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,840
and saying that's [ __ ] amazing can i

688
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,279
have some of that i can't really easily

689
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,359
ship clones all over the place but

690
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,240
allegedly we can get you seeds all over

691
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,199
the world

692
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,359
so i made golden goat seeds from a

693
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,279
golden goat plant i took a golden goat

694
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,639
took two clones of it treated one with

695
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,480
silver thiosulfate

696
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,799
it made pollen i applied that pollen

697
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,279
onto a female golden goat the same plant

698
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,240
just two clones so it's clone only i'm

699
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,879
using the clone

700
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,079
then i made seeds from that those seeds

701
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,679
are golden goat

702
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:58,158
s1 feminized seeds that is the only way

703
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,880
you can get pure unadulterated golden

704
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
goat

705
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
also i've made a golden goat back cross

706
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,480
which means

707
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
i took a plant that was very similar to

708
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
golden goat and crossed it to the golden

709
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,839
goat and the offspring looks very much

710
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
like golden goat i've talked about my

711
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,759
process in that

712
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,240
in depth in a couple of episodes but

713
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,079
that is a back cross

714
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,480
since there is not a male of golden goat

715
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,319
available i had to use a different male

716
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
to put pollen on that plant to make

717
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,319
seeds that is not

718
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
pure golden goat that is a bat cross

719
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,000
it's been adulterated

720
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,639
it is my responsibility as a responsible

721
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,759
breeder

722
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,038
to label that as the back cross which

723
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,279
it is so that is my rant on clone only

724
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,240
that is my rant and my reasoning on why

725
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,119
there is no

726
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,839
gorilla glue [ __ ] seeds that are not

727
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,519
s-ones

728
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,119
that's my rant on why there's no golden

729
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,558
goat that's my rant on why there are no

730
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,519
girl scout cookies

731
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,240
many of these plants were clone only and

732
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,319
there were no

733
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,839
options for other seeds the only person

734
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,000
that had the seeds were the guys that

735
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,158
made it

736
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so let's say i make a cross let's talk

737
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,440
about something i'm not going to release

738
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
um i don't even want to tell you some

739
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
[ __ ] that i've got going on that i'm not

740
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,679
going to release

741
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,439
let's just say that i took a rise and i

742
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,000
crossed it to this new blue kombucha

743
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
bottle that's

744
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
there's a blue kombucha bottle in front

745
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,279
of me that's a new [ __ ] strain name

746
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,600
a rise to blue kombucha bottle i'm gonna

747
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,599
grow out 25 seeds of it i'm gonna find

748
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,719
the [ __ ] champion female out of there

749
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,558
i've got this amazing

750
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
arise to blue kombucha female we're

751
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,720
gonna call it kombucha rise that's how

752
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
my brain works kombucha rise

753
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
but i'm never gonna give anybody a seed

754
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,960
i'm gonna hoard these seeds

755
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
these are mine blue kombucha rye seeds

756
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
all go in my safe

757
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,919
they're locked away i'm going to forget

758
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,759
about them maybe i'll lose them

759
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,159
i don't know they won't germinate that's

760
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,158
it there's this one plant that i grew

761
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,760
this blue kombucha rise that i selected

762
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,278
i got rid of all the others they weren't

763
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,038
[ __ ] elites i've got one blue

764
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,960
kombucha rise

765
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,480
make more of that you can't do it

766
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
because there's no mail i didn't give

767
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,440
anybody any seeds

768
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,719
maybe i gave you the clone but i will

769
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,558
never give you the seeds

770
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,839
you've got that clone you can't make

771
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,079
more of that unless

772
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,240
you adulterate it with other pollen or

773
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,839
you self it so that's my rant on

774
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,640
clone only uh gorilla glue 4 girl scout

775
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,480
cookies

776
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,559
uh there are a lot of other things out

777
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
there that are clone only blue dream is

778
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:14,960
clone only

779
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,678
a lot of that popular [ __ ] that you guys

780
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
are really seeking is clone only so

781
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,960
part of why i'm doing this rant is to

782
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,719
let you know to be careful i need to

783
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
educate you i want to educate you be

784
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,079
careful in your quest for seeds

785
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
don't get duped don't get ripped off

786
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,759
don't fall for false labeling

787
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,278
uh look for a seed brand a seed vendor

788
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,679
that's been around for a while

789
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,558
i'm not saying only shop with me there

790
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
are a lot of people that have been

791
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,599
around a lot longer than me

792
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,278
that have a lot of other things to offer

793
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,519
that i don't offer but be

794
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,880
very careful when you're shopping if

795
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,639
they've got blue dream

796
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
if they've got gorilla glue if they've

797
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
got girl scout cookies

798
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,599
and it just says regular seeds and

799
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:53,839
doesn't tell you what it's crossed with

800
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,278
be very leery of those seeds

801
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,278
