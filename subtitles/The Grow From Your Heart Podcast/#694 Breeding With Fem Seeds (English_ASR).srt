support on the black friday sales that's

50
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,560
right we put out a couple of new strains

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,159
and if you were looking for those new

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
strains on black friday and you had a

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,159
problem finding them that is because

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,159
they sold out almost instantly that's

55
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,759
right they dropped it 420 on most of the

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,280
vendors by 4 30 most of them were sold

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,199
out so a lot of people were sending me

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,598
messages asking where and how to get

59
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,919
those new drops i do apologize they went

60
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,159
quite quickly they are being restocked

61
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,159
by the time this episode comes out most

62
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,919
of the vendors should be replenished

63
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,919
with the new drops of soccer souffle in

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,679
the machine so check the website check

65
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,079
the vendor links you should be able to

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
find those new packs in stock somewhere

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,840
so if you were looking for the machine

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,359
and soccer souffle on black friday and

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
you were unable to get those i do

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
apologize however they should be back in

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
stock now so once again check that

72
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,840
vendor list check the websites you

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,080
should be able to find soccer souffle

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,759

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,239
podcast all right let's jump into the

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,640
main topic of this episode this question

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
came from the irie genetics website if

102
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,079
you've got a grow question you can visit

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,878
the irie genetics website there is a

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,879
grow help tab simply click on that tab

105
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,639
it will ask you a few preliminary

106
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,199
questions if you are asking a plant

107
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,000
specific question or a problem specific

108
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,000
question those uh preliminary questions

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,598
will help me kind of diagnose your

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
problem give me some details let me know

111
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,959
what's going on in the grow then at the

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
bottom it does give you the opportunity

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,879
to type out in detail what's going on

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,039
and ask your question this was not a

115
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,560
plant specific question this is a

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,439
breeding question that came from our

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,079
friend laser king and it goes a lot like

118
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,959
this it says rasta jeff when you have

119
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,680
feminized seeds and you make feminized

120
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,638
f2 well you have the same genetic

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
diversity as in regular f2 seeds that is

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
a very good question there are a couple

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,600
of things to unpack to get to the answer

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
to that one so our friend is asking

125
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
about feminized seeds if you don't

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
understand femme seeds i've done several

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,320
episodes on feminized seeds um there's a

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,960
full podcast about it if you type in

129
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,120
grow from your heart podcast feminized

130
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,599
seeds it will come up so that is a good

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,240
basis for feminized seeds a good base

132
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
education um so our friend has

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,639
apparently has feminized seeds or is

134
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,560
thinking about breeding with femme seeds

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
and they've got so when you make a batch

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,959
of seeds that first batch

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,478
we're going to call it for the sake of

138
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,719
this question here we're going to call

139
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,279
it an f1 when you take two strains that

140
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
are uh non-similar parents and you cross

141
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,599
them you have now made an f1

142
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,279
you probably made a polyhybrid but

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
that's just details to talk about in the

144
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,279
future we're going to say for this

145
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
question you've made an f1 so you've

146
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,239
taken a plant and reversed it and used

147
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,359
that pollen to put onto a different

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,800
plant and now we have made an f1 that is

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,080
feminized

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,240
that may also be called an s1 it could

151
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,719
also be called an r1 we're going to talk

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,038
about that it kind of those labels and

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
people are going to uh those are kind of

154
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,120
made up labels by the cannabis industry

155
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,120
we're kind of bastardizing all of these

156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
labels for the cannabis industry i think

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,519
s and r were kind of made up by the

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
industry to indicate so let's talk about

159
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,318
what an s and an r are because that will

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,400
help us out uh when we are reversing

161
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,280
plants when i'm making feminized seeds

162
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,879
we are reversing a plant i'm taking a

163
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,279
female plant and treating it with a

164
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,439
solution to cause that plant to create

165
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,519
pollen which will all be female pollen

166
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,478
then we put that pollen on

167
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,680
a another female plant now

168
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,439
if i take

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
let's just say golden goat golden goat

170
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,600
is a really good place to start if i

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
take a golden goat female plant and

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
reverse it and make pollen out of that

173
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,799
golden goat i can either put that pollen

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,038
on another golden goat female or i can

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
put that pollen on any other female in

176
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,120
my grow

177
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,000
if i put that feminized pollen from

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
golden goat onto golden goat i have done

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,120
what is called selfing that plant has

180
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,840
selfed self-itself this may be crass but

181
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,840
you will never forget it that plant just

182
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,758
[ __ ] itself and made babies you're

183
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,918
never gonna forget that it is a little

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,199
crass but it is in your brain forever it

185
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,680
is s self self itself that is golden

186
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,840
goat two golden goat nothing but golden

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
goat s1 in that genetics you're not

188
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,159
gonna find anything but golden goat you

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,319
may find some recessive traits from the

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
golden goat parents and grandparents but

191
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
there's no adulteration it's just golden

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,199
goat genetics in that line if i were to

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,079
take that golden goat pollen and put it

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,478
on any other plant that is going to be

195
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,918
labeled an r plant a r r is for reversal

196
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,120
the number that follows that will be

197
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,560
your generation it can be an r1 and r2

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
but in this case we're just going to say

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,598
r1 the first time i make that pollen and

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,759
put it on a different plant the seeds

201
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,918
that come out of that are now labeled an

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,840
r1 it's a reversal one it is an f1 but

203
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,639
to be friendly and to give more

204
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,119
information a breeder would like to uh

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,319
would be polite if they label that as an

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,399
s1 or an r1 which would indicate that it

207
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
is feminized and it would let you know a

208
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,560
little bit of how it has been created

209
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,318
and worked that is why we use uh more

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,240
specific labels other than f1 s1 r1 so i

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
think i've talked about the difference b

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,478
if it were a regular seat it would be an

213
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,399
f1 if it was not feminized it'd be an f1

214
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,439
since we're working with fems

215
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,598
we get s1s and r1's so let me catch

216
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,680
myself back up on my notes

217
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,240
the original question is are we going to

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,519
have the same genetic diversity as in

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,079
regular f2 seeds that genetic diversity

220
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,799
will be dictated by a couple of things

221
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,519
first of all was the original plant a

222
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,278
self plant or a reversed plant and now

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
the second question is are you putting

224
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,918
that pollen on the same plant or a

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,080
different plant and the reason i'm

226
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,480
asking that is because that is going to

227
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,800
unlock different potential there are

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
more ingredients going into the pie

229
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,479
think about it this way if i've got

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
golden goat and i'm only putting golden

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,039
goats a golden goat 100 golden goat i'm

232
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,360
going to get

233
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,759
probably 75 to 80 percent of my

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,839
phenotypes are going to be very golden

235
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,639
goat some of those other phenotypes the

236
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
other 25 20ish percent are going to look

237
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,879
like the parents that created golden

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
goat and possibly the grandparents that

239
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,278
created those plants that's a little bit

240
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
unlikely but it is possible when you're

241
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,278
working with genetics you do see the

242
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,639
history when you're making things but

243
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,639
we're not going to see any other

244
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,480
genetics other than the ingredients that

245
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,159
were in that pie that make golden goat

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,639
but it's going to be very golden goat

247
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,039
dominant now let's talk about if i took

248
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,679
a golden goat and pollinated let's just

249
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,919
say lemon skunk and made lemon jeffrey

250
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,559
now you've got the opportunity to see

251
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,639
the parents of the golden goat and also

252
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,479
the parents of the lemon jeffrey in that

253
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,559
cross we've got two different

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,360
ingredients so we've got more options

255
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,559
for more flavors most of the time we're

256
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
going to see

257
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,518
a beautiful 50 50 mix of golden goat and

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,839
lemon skunk which is a beautiful

259
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,919
phenotype of the lemon jeffrey but

260
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
you're going to see leaners toward the

261
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,599
golden goat and you're going to see

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,919
leaners toward the lemon jeffrey now

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,240
this is going to depend on

264
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,399
which plant is more dominant in the

265
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
genetics which traits take over there

266
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,799
will be recessive traits there will be

267
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,360
dominant traits there will be

268
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,000
co-dominant traits which traits in your

269
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,600
plants when in that mix it's like you

270
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
just put all these ingredients in a bowl

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,278
and you shook them up which one's got

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
more flavor which one's gonna win in

273
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,639
that mix which flavor and there are so

274
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
many other things to think about when it

275
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,480
comes to breeding it's not just flavor

276
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,639
the flavor the aromas the buzz and the

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,159
appearance are all things we can quickly

278
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,480
identify but you've also got to think

279
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,559
about how does it grow is it resistant

280
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
is there resistance to pests and

281
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,239
pathogens and problems and stress those

282
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,319
are very important things to think about

283
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,039
but i'm kind of getting off topic here

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
um the main thing we're going to see is

285
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,078
the parents you're going to see the

286
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,040
golden goat and the lemon skunk and then

287
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,120
you may

288
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,719
may see a little bit of the golden go

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
parents there's romulan island sweet

290
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,680
skunk hawaiian sativa in there you may

291
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,078
see some of those traits pop up in the

292
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,439
lemon skunk ah there's some sort of

293
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,958
skunk and some sort of lemon i don't

294
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
even know exactly what made the lemon

295
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,518
skunk uh but you're gonna see traits of

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,320
those parents honestly a lot of the

297
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
things if i reverse golden goat i see i

298
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
can identify the golden goat traits in

299
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,600
it and then i can identify the traits

300
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,278
that come from the other plants very

301
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
well the lemon jeffrey

302
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,519
that spacious between the notes that

303
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
spacious growth between the nodes that

304
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,399
directly comes from the lemon skunk that

305
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,240
crazy wicked potency that comes directly

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,120
from the golden goat so it kind of

307
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,879
depends on the dominance of the traits

308
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
in which plant you're going to use now

309
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,919
let me get myself back on track and

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,600
focus a little bit because the question

311
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:40,159
is specifically about s2 or f2 with

312
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,519
feminized seeds and will we see the same

313
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,039
genetic diversity as in as within an f2

314
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,159
in my experience no ah when you make f2s

315
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,838
of regular seeds the f2 is when you find

316
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,679
the wild diversity the wild variation uh

317
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
i think it is called transgressive

318
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,078
segregation or recessive segregation one

319
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,360
of those words is accurate somebody tell

320
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,120
me because i just pulled that out of the

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,639
sky randomly and there are a lot of

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
words in my brain one of those is

323
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,759
accurate but it's the uh the segregation

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,360
word when we find uh offspring that

325
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,600
outperform the original appearance

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,399
that's when you see stuff like that so

327
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
uh the f2s will show wild variation you

328
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,679
see a lot of uh you see a lot of things

329
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
that look like the mom a lot of things

330
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,120
that look like the dad a lot of things

331
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,278
that are 50 50. then we see a lot of

332
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
crazy grandparent traits get brought out

333
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,639
so if you're looking from to find some

334
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,399
of the older stuff in the line you can

335
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
kind of find that in the f2s that's

336
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,759
where it will represent itself or

337
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,440
present itself

338
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,039
then you find the f3 and breed those

339
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
together and wash all that old stuff out

340
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,639
and start narrowing it down that's kind

341
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,719
of the process for there with the

342
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,399
feminized seed you don't really bring

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
out all that old stuff you were kind of

344
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,879
locking it in even tighter one thing i

345
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,958
have noticed when you do make the

346
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,519
feminized s2s

347
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,439
sometimes you can make kind of weaker

348
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,320
spindly plants that don't perform as

349
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,639
well sometimes you really lock in super

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
traits that have very uniform plants

351
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
that s2

352
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,639
will come out almost like an f4 and f5

353
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,879
with the uniformity if you've done

354
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,440
proper selection again a lot of this

355
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,439
will be based very much on the plants

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
which you select the dominance of the

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
genes which you're using but since

358
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,000
you're using feminized seeds and doing

359
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,680
that the s's the s ones and only and not

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
doing ours you've got the good

361
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,719
opportunity of locking in the traits

362
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,879
that you really want but it's all about

363
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,879
phenotypical selection something i have

364
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,278
noticed is that different phenotypes of

365
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,120
the same strain will react differently

366
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,720
when they are feminized

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,278
i had a plan and we'll just say number

368
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
nine and number four were both reversed

369
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,679
and self to each other and number nine

370
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
was awesome number four was trash all

371
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
the seeds that came out of there showed

372
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,399
me garbage i did not like what they

373
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,159
represented number nine was awesome

374
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,879
the plant my favorite plant that came

375
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,078
out of uh the s ones of number nine i

376
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,519
made s2s of those and that got labeled

377
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,039
uh if i start talking numbers i'll

378
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,799
reveal what it is because it's known as

379
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:05,198
number 77. uh number 77 had problems

380
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,599
being reversed it was so dominant and so

381
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,599
female that i could not reverse it i had

382
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,839
to really spray the [ __ ] out of it start

383
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
spraying it early to get it to reverse

384
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,519
so the original question is will i see

385
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,278
the same genetic diversity in the f2s uh

386
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,799
no they're going to be in my opinion

387
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,799
they'll be much more locked down you're

388
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,439
not going to get i was i was rambling

389
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,838
about how the f2s and regular seeds

390
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,639
bring up that wild genetic diversity the

391
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
feminized f2s kind of lock it in really

392
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,320
tight you're not going to see much

393
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,198
diversity at all it's going to be

394
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,040
more like an f3 or an f4 of regular

395
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,439
seeds and it's going to be very very

396
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,599
uniform if you have selected the correct

397
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
phenotype like i said number nine was

398
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,920
amazing

399
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,159
number four did not want to be uh f2 in

400
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,078
any way now i kind of hinted at this a

401
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,639
moment ago but think of breeding a

402
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,958
little bit as chefing every ingredient

403
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,720
you put in is going to add to the mix

404
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,759
now think about portions of those

405
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,560
ingredients if i add one portion of one

406
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,799
thing my meal tastes or my mix my final

407
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,039
product tastes like that one thing if i

408
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,359
put in golden goat it tastes like golden

409
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,838
goat it is only golden goat if i put in

410
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,039
some lemon skunk now probably i'm going

411
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,040
to get 50 50 percent lemon skunk 50

412
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,639
golden go and we shake it up you got to

413
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,240
think about like there's going to be the

414
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,919
edges of the pan or the edges of the

415
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
cookie sheet or however that's where

416
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,958
your outliers are going to be right in

417
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,559
the middle is going to be your your

418
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,518
regular [ __ ] then the outliers are going

419
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,359
to be out there you're going to find

420
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,078
some weirdos out there but most of your

421
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,000
flavors are going to be 50 50 then let's

422
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,879
think about if we're breeding feminized

423
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,720
plants to itself again you just added

424
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,320
more golden goat to the mix so you're

425
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,720
just doubling up on the golden goat

426
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,800
flavor making it super golden goat now

427
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,800
that one is gonna have that one batch of

428
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,039
pie or that one cake is double golden

429
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,639
goat so now whatever you breed to that

430
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,159
it's going to be two golden goats two

431
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,600
whatever you breed it to technically

432
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,198
just because of the breeding that you've

433
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
done you've locked in that golden goat

434
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,439
trait so hard kind of think about it as

435
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,278
if uh we filled the pan with golden goat

436
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
you're only going to take golden goat

437
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,838
but if we fill the pan with 50 golden

438
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
goat and 50 lemon skunk and blend it

439
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,600
together now right in the middle there

440
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,240
is going to be a beautiful blend of 50

441
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
percent lemon scott 5050 lemon skunk and

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,919
golden goat maybe on the outer edges

443
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,198
maybe we didn't blend it too well you're

444
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,719
gonna get some that's a little more

445
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,719
golden goat some that's a little more

446
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,278
lemon skunk and the opposite on other

447
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
parts that's kind of how breeding works

448
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,360
if you want to be real basic about it

449
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,958
and compare it to chefing i know i took

450
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,519
off on a good ramble on that one but the

451
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,000
short answer is you will not see as much

452
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,240
diversity in the feminized f2 as you

453
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,958
would in the regular f2 because you're

454
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,519
not unlocking that pandora's box

455
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,399
in my experience and in my opinion the

456
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,039
phenotypes do come out much more uniform

457
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,799
much more regular and quite a bit like

458
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,599
that original plant that you started

459
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,679
with uh sometimes though you can create

460
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,879
weak and spindly offspring in the

461
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:02,319
feminized f2 but a lot of the times you

462
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,679
do make very stable uniform uh viable

463
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,199
crosses when doing the feminized f2

464
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,600
alright ladies and gentlemen boys and

465
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,839

podcast this may be a quick episode

472
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,400
after some editing i do want to make

473
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
sure to get this episode completed i've

474
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
been experiencing some camera technical

475
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,240
difficulties i want to get this episode

476
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
done get these cameras checked out see

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,558
what's going on i do promise longer

478
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,240
better episodes in the future i do have

479
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,599
two more breeding questions here lined

480
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,839
up we will get to those in the next

481
