60
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,500
at Evo labs so we they I said we like

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm involved in this [ __ ] i smoke it's

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,110
my role in this part of consumer level

63
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,689
only I do a little product research for

64
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,710
these guys but uh so I'll be your space

65
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,569
monkey I don't care

66
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,460
we take they take some shatter they take

67
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,590
cash I think they're taking co2 oil I'm

68
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,159
90% sure that this is made with co2 oil

69
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,870
a co2 extraction and there's a lot of

70
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,219
people right now in the industry playing

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,439
with refining co2 oil in one way or

72
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,689
another and this seems to be my favorite

73
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,020
way this is a fractal distil this is the

74
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:58,729
first home run I've gotta play with all

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,050
of the clear the they're calling it

76
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,149
distillate all of the distillate is done

77
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,000
with a fractal distillation process and

78
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,760
they're separating basically everything

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,189
the cannabinoids and terpenoids and the

80
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,919
lipids are all pulled apart and this

81
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,829
container right here is a container of

82
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,750
nothing but the THC this is ninety

83
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,890
percent ninety point nine four percent

84
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,560
THC and 1.1 percent CBD this is rod

85
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,669
distill it from Evo Evo labs I'm gonna

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
open the jar here and try to contain

87
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:29,099
describe what's in this container the

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,150
best I can

89
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:38,459
it looks like really runny honey or ah

90
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,840
super clear olive oil maybe yeah but

91
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,730
it's got more of the consistency of like

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,860
honey or maybe a little bigger than any

93
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,319
olive oil I've ever seen but yeah the

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,180
color might be right though yeah yeah it

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,919
just looks like it's like honey almost

96
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,219
in there but this doesn't have much

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,589
flavor it's it is just raw

98
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,120
super stupid potent I put a little bit

99
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,670
of this on the dabber and this is where

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,110
it gets fun I take that little bit

101
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:06,089
that's on the dabber and I dunk that

102
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:09,420
into the ghost train haze raw turps this

103
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,400
is mostly terpenoids with a little bit

104
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,379
of cannabinoids like one or two percent

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,510
to mind if I call it the adult version

106
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,850
of fun dips this is definitely well

107
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,798
we've oh I'm a Deadhead and we've got

108
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,080
our own little version of fun dips but

109
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,779
this is the weed world of a fun dendrite

110
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,359
this is uh it's a beautiful thing this

111
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:31,929
is a so you take that beautiful ninety

112
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,150
percent THC distillate and then you dunk

113
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,120
it you dunk it and the glorious part is

114
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,339
in my other hand I've got some og cush

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,408
Terps so I can either dunk it in my og

116
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,489
cush Terps or I can dunk it over here my

117
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:44,769
ghost train haze Terps

118
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,840
or I could dunk it in one and then I

119
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:49,478
could dunk it in the other and we're

120
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,758
changing up the flavors it the og cush

121
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:54,818
Terps if you put it on this distillate

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,770
and dammit it tastes like you if apples

123
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,468
tasted like og cush and you bit into an

124
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,758
og cush apple it was just oh gee cush

125
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:02,978
all in my mouth and you could almost

126
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,689
chew the flavor that's how much oh gee

127
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:07,478
cush flavor these Terps put in your face

128
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:09,908
it's the flavor contents really really

129
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:12,490
nice this way and then the high from the

130
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:13,990
distillate combo'd with I really like

131
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,120
the high that I get from the ghost train

132
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,400
haze it's uh this is sativa dominant

133
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,110
strain so I talk about this every day

134
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,209
the the other stuff that's in it that's

135
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,060
the THC is definitely a big part of the

136
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:28,149
high but everything else that that's in

137
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,680
it really plays with that THC in some

138
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,288
fun ways

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,329
I almost never go for the most potent on

140
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:36,339
the shelf and if you think about the

141
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:38,800
rest of your life you typically don't do

142
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,628
that either you've got to get that other

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,900
component to it in this way you can get

144
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,210
both you can get insanely potent and

145
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,888
really really flavorful I've been kind

146
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:51,299
of being a snobby [ __ ] I take some of

147
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,199
this blue shirt 120 micron fresh frozen

148
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,569
solvent less hash and I roll out a

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,908
little patty and then i dunk some some

150
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,169
some durbin poison shatter onto it and

151
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:01,418
then I rubbed a little cactus cooler

152
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:03,189
live resin on top of that I'm gonna put

153
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,628
a little bit of the Terps on it and then

154
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,399
I put some of that ninety percent THC

155
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,370
distillate on top of there and I took a

156
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,288
big-ass dab of that I remember in high

157
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,689
school when he used to go park somewhere

158
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:16,568
and see how high you could get I don't

159
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:19,028
think we got that high when I when I

160
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,158
took that big-ass dab my arm hair was

161
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:22,810
wiggling around like it was a visibly

162
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:26,800
waving like doing something similar

163
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,750
which is much much cheaper product with

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
with just your typical wax or shatter

165
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of

166
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,269
pancake it out real far throw a little

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,728
wax in the middle roll up a little

168
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,620
taquito and dab that but mine

169
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,848
much smaller and much less fancy than

170
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,259
the ones you've been throwing down I

171
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:43,930
like to go big or go home and I take

172
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:49,538
dad's home I'll go a little and go often

173
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:52,209
I go big and go often that's one of the

174
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:53,769
best parts about taking dabs is that you

175
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,528
can grab the dabber and Mike can take

176
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:58,389
his dosage Mike's a cigarette smoker so

177
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,949
when you get Mike worked up a little bit

178
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,838
you can hear him gurgle he doesn't even

179
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,300
need dabs to start making funky longer

180
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:07,300
noises sounds like the bong occasionally

181
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,278
so you give them I give Mike if you

182
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,990
handed me the dabs that I gave Mike I

183
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:13,749
would laugh at you I'd say can you maybe

184
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,519
triple quadruple that up bread andd Mike

185
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:17,588
takes just little pince adds dad's

186
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,498
probably the dad's you take Mike takes

187
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:22,329
that size of a dab and he will cough and

188
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:24,879
turn purple and get sweaty with the

189
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:26,698
email carp cap setup as smooth as it is

190
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,379
over here you knock off like a beast

191
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,180
it's not nearly as bad as hone because I

192
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,789
don't have that carve cap to cut the cap

193
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,649
adds quite a bit people get yourself a

194
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,269
carp cap this is a 710 episode let's

195
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,389
educate folks on the email right quick

196
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:43,240
the the electronic continuously heated

197
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,009
now is a beautiful beautiful thing it's

198
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,550
also a little dangerous depending on

199
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:51,129
where you dab I I had one in the car for

200
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,560
several days well the space I I dab

201
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,528
often is also shared by three large dogs

202
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,009
that are really furry and psychotic and

203
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:01,658
so like if I was gonna add an email to

204
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,520
that makes like something would get set

205
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:05,408
on fire that I care about yeah dog would

206
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,359
get burned the bald spot somewhere so

207
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:09,430
there's kind of a reason I don't have

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,379
one yet but it's it's on the short list

209
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,098
of things to treat myself to I had to

210
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:16,449
take mine out of the car I was getting a

211
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:19,378
careless I was getting too high in the

212
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,098
car which I was like I'm pretty pretty

213
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,919
medicated here I got to chill out on

214
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:26,620
this and then also I had to set the rig

215
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,508
in the cupholder and I forgot it was

216
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,740
there and I felt warmth a couple times I

217
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,360
don't know that I was gonna burn myself

218
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,528
but I was like ooh that is warm over

219
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,509
there and had to think about it again

220
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,948
I'm kind of close to that so I took the

221
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,918
email out of the car that doesn't happen

222
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:40,778
anymore be careful you guys I can't tell

223
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,370
you what to do but if there's somebody

224
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:44,409
in the backseat that needs to have their

225
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,089
medical cannabis available while you're

226
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,528
driving they can consume their medical

227
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,230
cannabis do your thing you're an adult

228
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,769
but so the email there's a box on my

229
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,800
table

230
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,500
it's uh six inches long four inches tall

231
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,839
it's smaller than the original Nintendo

232
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,419
but a little taller yeah okay yeah yeah

233
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,889
and it's got a display on it little LED

234
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,509
display with the number it's got a power

235
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,279
switch on it but one of the coolest

236
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:08,049
[ __ ] features it's got a USB port

237
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,850
Mike is trying his phone pretty much

238
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,799
every episode that I've been on in the

239
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,420
last six months my phone's been charging

240
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,539
on that USB slot there's a really

241
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:18,189
beautiful shout out to my friend Gideon

242
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,079
this you know was actually a gift from

243
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,760
giddy up at emo tech so big shout out

244
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,500
and shout out to Margolese for the

245
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,990
replacement coils I appreciate that bro

246
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,279
ah but so there's this box with an LED

247
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,080
screen on the front with numbers

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,970
displayed on it then coming out of that

249
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,129
box is another cord it's a silver cord

250
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,960
it's a silver braided cord and it goes

251
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:40,779
to where the deck so if you're using any

252
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,400
sort of nail setup instead of the little

253
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,629
nail that sits inside the rig and the

254
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,240
dome or a titanium domeless we've got a

255
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:51,610
much larger titanium domeless that has

256
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,500
this coil leading to it and then it's

257
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,899
tightly wrapped around the nail so that

258
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,970
it can evenly heat that surface yeah to

259
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,730
whatever temperature we feel like and

260
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,810
that's where I want to jump in and

261
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,810
everybody talks about what temperature

262
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,789
is your email sent to I do not believe

263
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:09,879
that that number right there where it

264
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,259
says 717 right it's not at all integer I

265
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,759
don't think that's a temperature I don't

266
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,009
think it correlates to the actual

267
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,830
temperature on my nail surface because I

268
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,960
think this box would cost much more

269
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,670
money for it to actually have a

270
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,580
thermostat inside it that's doing that

271
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,379
one of our friends that is a guy that

272
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,200
works on my website actually told me

273
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,700
that's actually a frequency always

274
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,500
understood it to be is just the random

275
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,570
frequency that it kicks out plus it

276
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,700
gives you something to work it's like

277
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:40,410
your speaker's 11 doesn't [ __ ] mean

278
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,030
anything perfect yeah something to you

279
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,219
is like the prime spot if I go right any

280
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,289
six it gets a little you don't want to

281
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,990
hear that Jerry starts son and a little

282
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,579
extra heroin if you learn about too loud

283
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,750
I've posted pictures before us getting

284
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,639
ready to record and stuff and somebody

285
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,980
always chimes in and there's like dude

286
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,990
your e knows like 300 degrees too hot

287
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,680
and it's like that's not a temperature

288
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,120
is always like the first three replies

289
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,599
I'm sure if you bought seven emo tech

290
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,519
units

291
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,319
I've seen this helpful that have the

292
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,328
temperature display and I like that yeah

293
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,679
the one task rock made the original and

294
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,750
we're gonna talk about task rock you

295
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,799
guys this is the [ __ ] 710 episode of

296
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,500
you best believe we're gonna talk about

297
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,359
a boy task rock the original email that

298
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,179
task rock of highly-educated the

299
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,539
innovator the originator that original

300
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:27,189
email did I think that temperature did

301
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,899
correlate to the one in the box although

302
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,389
I'm not certain but I'm pretty sure it

303
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,519
did shot it to Big D with the original

304
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,860
he's got the museum version he's got the

305
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,198
first email that task made it's on

306
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,789
Daniels shelf much loved and respected a

307
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,969
big deep miss you bro hope to see you

308
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,139
soon

309
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,269
it's get you on the podcast into the

310
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:45,310
good old days I really don't think that

311
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,679
that number correlates I think like Mike

312
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:49,239
that's definitely not a temperature when

313
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,588
you get in your car or whatever whether

314
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,299
you like it where you really like the

315
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,100
jam out when your favorite song comes on

316
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,508
what born to be wild comes on you want

317
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,060
to drive on the freeway way too fast

318
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:03,399
whatever like 2339 what it's just a

319
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,109
random just aesthetic so it had

320
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,730
something for you to think about medium

321
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,990
high right before it starts crackling I

322
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,819
like to think my dad's kind of hot I

323
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,470
like the email a little hotter than most

324
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:16,149
people when Spence would come over shut

325
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,769
up dispenser from the garden immediately

326
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,629
turn it down you just you wouldn't even

327
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,919
ask he'd be like yo nail two hot dog and

328
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,899
just read you didn't say dog he would

329
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,519
call me the n-word you're nailed to hi

330
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,409
n-word and reach over and just turn my

331
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,789
[ __ ] now like it was his and I wouldn't

332
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,139
argue cuz that Spencer and he made the

333
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,088
hash for about too bad so I'm just gonna

334
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,470
let him do his thing but he'd always

335
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,589
turned it the [ __ ] down he'd be like my

336
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,430
Safa gif it always says esophagus so he

337
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,370
turned that [ __ ] down

338
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:41,138
I take pretty low temp dad's at home

339
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,419
every now and then I understood it or

340
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,250
like I sneeze between heating the nail

341
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,490
with the torch and going to dab and then

342
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,159
find it's a little too cold my puddle I

343
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:54,789
like a big chunky dad so I feel like I

344
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,259
have to overheat overheating is just hot

345
00:12:54,789 --> 00:13:02,169
enough to cook all that otherwise I'm

346
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:06,278
sucking like we used to go way close

347
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:07,539
like keep eating oh I saw the grateful

348
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,019
the remaining members of the Grateful

349
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,549
Dead

350
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,919
Phil Lesh doesn't to her anymore so they

351
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,629
call themselves dead and Coe I saw dead

352
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,068
and co-ed in Boulder

353
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,929
shadow it's my friend that took me to

354
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:18,019
that show but I saw both the dead in

355
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,299
Boulder and

356
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,769
again there were some kids taken dads in

357
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,118
the back of this SUV they had the

358
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,678
tailgate up and they had the daybreak

359
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,910
sitting up on a little thing so that all

360
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,129
they had to do was put it to their face

361
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:29,958
and the dude heats it with the torch and

362
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm just walking toward this car walking

363
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,878
through rows walking through the parking

364
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,600
lot and I see him just and I was like

365
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,999
it's hot

366
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,308
you [ __ ] stop trying to turn that

367
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:41,480
nail in the [ __ ] water right now and

368
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,708
I didn't say anything that's none of my

369
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,058
business I was like oh he's gonna put

370
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,669
the dome on or whatever and let it cool

371
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:48,379
nah bro I did through the dome on and

372
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:51,019
[ __ ] put that dabber to that nail

373
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,178
while it was glowing bright orange and I

374
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,068
just cringed I was like oh my god like

375
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:56,869
it was not my place to say anything but

376
00:13:55,068 --> 00:14:00,528
my heart just tingled I was like oh god

377
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,239
that for poor [ __ ] damn it not only are

378
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,610
you ruining yourself for no reason

379
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,920
you're also losing so much of the flavor

380
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,808
do the Terps man I'm burnin the Terps I

381
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,698
the downside is if you understood it you

382
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:16,548
end up just wasting your hash on the

383
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,298
nail if puddles instead of vaporizers in

384
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,639
our world

385
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:21,438
so that's let me let me talk about that

386
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,028
when I taught when I hid the email when

387
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:24,169
I'm taking a big fat AB a lot of times

388
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,548
you guys I come home from work and I

389
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,318
want a dad like a half gram maybe a

390
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,919
grandma hash in one [ __ ] dab I'm not

391
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,118
kidding

392
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,588
there are more people in this room

393
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,240
they'll wait raise their hands a [ __ ]

394
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:34,519
testify Rasta Jeff will pull a grandma

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,490
dad gram dad no problem we got hands up

396
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,169
testify it's a lot but I like to take a

397
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,209
big fat dab I will do that on the email

398
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,919
a lot of times I'm smoking these Terps

399
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,948
and the distillate I bust out this one

400
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,688
right here my elevate cycler with the

401
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:49,128
little banger on it yeah it's got a they

402
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:51,139
say it's quartz I bet you money that's

403
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,938
[ __ ] glass I got a little glass of

404
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,318
banger on there that's my flavor savor

405
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:57,740
that I think it tastes a little bit

406
00:14:54,318 --> 00:15:00,349
better I think quartz versus ty I think

407
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,759
sometimes you gotta say that the quartz

408
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,778
tastes a little bit better in my opinion

409
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,759
I I have that on my short list of things

410
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:08,808
I want to treat myself with is a nice

411
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,129
quartz banger

412
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:15,678
I'd really do I'm due this one here this

413
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:18,048
is a highly-educated titanium base with

414
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,789
the quartz the dishes - I saw some of

415
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:22,509
that on Instagram and didn't let myself

416
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:25,248
look because I was doing car repairs

417
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:26,778
myself that likes to travel with a

418
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:28,220
little rig like that that's the way to

419
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:29,299
go because this banger the way that I

420
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,490
travel with it that

421
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,649
would get destroyed quickly well where

422
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,190
were my Deverick sits most of the time

423
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,809
that would be safe like I can't risk

424
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,550
that you know right now but I could risk

425
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,099
the bug if the puppy could take the

426
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:44,719
bucket but not the email well it's safer

427
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,980
it's the cord that's the problem on the

428
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,930
email like just in practice I know my my

429
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,940
household well enough to me to know that

430
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:55,009
that rig would get yanked off that cord

431
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,570
is dangerous at this table right that

432
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,028
cord is knocked over and broken this

433
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,829
exact rig once before just sitting there

434
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:02,899
had just wobbled and spun itself over

435
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:04,729
cuz the you guys the cord on this he

436
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,350
knows it's was coiled in a box for a

437
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,539
hundred years it looks like and shifting

438
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,070
[ __ ] China and vacuum-packed and so

439
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:11,870
it's gonna be coy lis shaped for the

440
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,070
rest of its life and sometimes you try

441
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,990
to straighten it out and it makes you

442
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,570
think it went straight but then it just

443
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,750
starts coil and slowly winding itself up

444
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,190
and tip your rig over so turn your email

445
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,289
off when you leave the house that's a

446
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,670
reminder to myself also you know have no

447
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,828
idea how many times I've come home and

448
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:29,708
been like oh never leave the house with

449
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:34,819
an active heat source running like that

450
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:36,229
basic human ah low tip is better when

451
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm doing a small dab is what I wanted

452
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,528
to kind of take that email versus the

453
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,059
quartz the titanium versus course if I

454
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,528
do a nice thing about the quartz is you

455
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,629
can bring that temp down even further

456
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:46,639
just let it cool get it get it glowy

457
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,889
high and let it go do it yes don't be

458
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,629
that do be that guy shout out to Jason

459
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:52,159
margulies I got so many friends it'll

460
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,629
heat the nail until it's glowing orange

461
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,100
and bust on a [ __ ] timer and they

462
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:56,838
have timed exactly like from what it

463
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,209
glows right here bro you hit go and wait

464
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,600
this many seconds perfect [ __ ] die

465
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:04,068
bro yeah I'm always like no you waited

466
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,390
too long I should have gone seven

467
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:07,338
seconds sooner than that because it's

468
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,689
too cool for me I like a little warm but

469
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:10,879
if I'm trying to dad these Terps all

470
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,790
oftentimes go for the quartz and go low

471
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,110
temp low temp they we say you got to

472
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:18,230
taste it to waste it

473
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,668
hit it low temp carb cap it just get all

474
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,799
that flavor in there take a little tiny

475
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,150
dab and then grab a q-tip and heat the

476
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,649
nail just a little bit and clean it out

477
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,809
with the q-tip and now you got a fresh

478
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,759
banger again they call that the q-tip

479
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:30,619
tech I don't play that way I heat the

480
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,660
[ __ ] out of it until it's clean and then

481
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:34,428
I throw another dad in it that's that's

482
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,529
how I roll with the banger I'm not on

483
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,450
the q-tip tech in the low temp tech all

484
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:40,730
that I like take a phat dab and get it

485
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,830
on all right my buddy Adam mill would

486
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,950
say red means go he

487
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,819
and just throws a mad dab in there no I

488
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,970
can't

489
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:51,559
it's it's too much on my throat yeah low

490
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,140
tip is better for you low temp is better

491
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,369
I fine so guys when you're trying to set

492
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,590
the temperature to your email everyone's

493
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,639
like what temperature do I set it go

494
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:02,179
ahead Mike you got something to jump in

495
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,790
when I say that's the right setup is

496
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,100
really key to getting the most out of

497
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:10,549
your hash you you can take a really nice

498
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:12,319
low temp tab on an email and with the

499
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,279
carb cap you don't waste anything

500
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,960
there's even if you go really low it's

501
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,789
still gonna continuously heat that

502
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,309
surface and vaporize everything off

503
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,680
you've got a carb capped even if it

504
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,720
takes a second to get it done you're not

505
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,340
gonna lose anything you can actually

506
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,990
enjoy all of that and it just it's one

507
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:35,059
of those things where it takes the time

508
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,380
and investing in the right tools to

509
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,539
really get the best bang out of your

510
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,770
product and that's part of the reason I

511
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,359
end up so baked here is because I've

512
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,509
only got like half the pieces at home

513
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,219
and so when I low temp that I end up

514
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:48,440
losing a good bit off the top of my nail

515
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,299
and so small dabs anyway and you got to

516
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,070
clean it up I noticed it the first step

517
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,569
every time I come over here I coughed

518
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:58,309
way harder than I have in a week or two

519
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:00,529
and then I get a little bit higher that

520
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:02,899
I've been in a week for the size I think

521
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,599
is because I use a smaller rig than most

522
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,300
folks yeah my rigs a little bigger I

523
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,609
really like I prefer a smaller rig and I

524
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:13,159
prefer an email on a small rig right now

525
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:16,099
I'm hitting the Hitman sidecar the

526
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,779
e-series sidecar this whole way small to

527
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,919
the point and it heats to the point

528
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,720
where he's got to keep an eye on the

529
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,670
water level because it will cook itself

530
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,029
dry yeah yeah that that has happened

531
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,310
before my mad Rob is like [ __ ] four

532
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:32,559
inches tall I love these little rigs I

533
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,559
like this itself rod during a podcast

534
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,200
before the sloppy taking a dry dab this

535
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,289
elevate Klein it's taller but it still

536
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,120
got very very minimal amount of airspace

537
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:46,279
and that's it I don't want a lot of

538
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,229
space from the time that I put my dab on

539
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,970
the surface of this dad nail for it to

540
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,180
go down here down this tube into the

541
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,650
water and into my face I want as little

542
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,870
resistance as possible I just want to

543
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,240
get that dab

544
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,159
to my brain just give it to me and I

545
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,839
feel like all the percolators and all

546
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,580
the extra bubbles and [ __ ] that's just

547
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,230
stealing your dad's still in your Terps

548
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,250
stealing your flavor I don't want all

549
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,110
that extra bubble äj--

550
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,849
I want enough water just to cool it down

551
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:13,389
from hitting that nail and then let me

552
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:14,980
get it actually took dabs today through

553
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,270
this little rig without enough water in

554
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,650
it and I got ultra high that's stupid I

555
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,759
didn't have enough water in it was it

556
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,290
kind of it was kind of Bernie

557
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,259
it made my throat tingle a little bit

558
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:29,349
but holy [ __ ] I was red-eyed the first

559
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:32,079
time I used a really good portable hash

560
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:33,699
pen they never last for very long but

561
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,599
the first time I used one they gave you

562
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:42,580
like that first dozen hits well burn the

563
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:45,039
[ __ ] out of my circulation tastes like

564
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:46,569
hot plastic no it was a different

565
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,529
company still tasted like hot plastic

566
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:53,649
because the mouthpiece was plastic but

567
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:55,629
[ __ ] dude that burn lasted all week if

568
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,610
the throat burn for a week remember like

569
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,080
when you stay at a bong and fill it let

570
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:00,279
me get it full and you keep sucking and

571
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,869
that chamber would fill and you keep

572
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,279
sucking and all your friends like pull

573
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,279
it pull it and you look at him like nope

574
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,779
I'm gonna get highs bong it and then you

575
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,058
pull it and then all that smoke goes in

576
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,980
your head that's the point of a big pipe

577
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:13,269
or a big bong or a big rig build that

578
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,519
[ __ ] up and then kharbut and get

579
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,339
smoked if you notice add a brig there's

580
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,379
no carb you just want that [ __ ] smoke

581
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:22,058
I mean throw the card cap on to trap the

582
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,320
heat and in the nail and put a little

583
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:25,149
vacuum in there you got a little tiny

584
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:26,529
hole in the carb cap you get less air

585
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,730
flowing through that heat stays in there

586
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:29,200
every bit of air that comes through

587
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,549
moves that oil around on the top of the

588
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,319
nail then it goes into your brain and

589
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,940
then you get stupid high I don't feel

590
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,099
the need to suck like a liter of oxygen

591
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,769
through my bong before I start getting

592
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,779
my I'm not a fan of bad songs and I know

593
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:43,029
a lot of people that are I sell an

594
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,250
amazing nail that is it's a beautiful

595
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:47,799
six in one that's designed for rigs or

596
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,509
bongs it'll fit anything on the market

597
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,579
it's a copy of the highly educated

598
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,039
infinity nail I'm sure it is it's an

599
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:56,919
awful beautiful invention completely as

600
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,659
I'm talking about and every time I see

601
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,720
it and I've got extra money in my pocket

602
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm like that's [ __ ] so much now but

603
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,640
then I remember that I don't like dab

604
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,779
bongs it's just way too much volume

605
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,490
and I you

606
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,869
see it on the inside of the glass you're

607
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,240
like that's hash that's supposed to be

608
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,949
my brain yeah it's not it's on the side

609
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,210
yeah and as much as you coffin choke

610
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,830
anyway you don't need to spend that

611
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,420
extra energy on your lungs pulling a

612
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:23,750
liter of air up through your it's funny

613
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,670
I love a bomb for flower that's my

614
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,380
primary smoking device clean my bong

615
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,660
yesterday loved it

616
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,030
picked up flower today and yesterday

617
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,690
because that's mainly what I've been

618
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:38,180
smoking at home but for a nice nap you

619
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,309
got to go with a smaller rig yeah I

620
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,600
prefer when you started talking about

621
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:42,679
flower maybe you want a segue into

622
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,379
something else that I wrote down I

623
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,549
prefer indica flowers if I was gonna go

624
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,050
shopping like right here on the table

625
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,009
I've got some blue shirt that I grew

626
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,460
with the green and healthy wellness

627
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,190
garden

628
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,600
I smell so yummy and then here in this

629
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,519
container I got some Jeff Shoji that I

630
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,039
grew these are both heavy indica

631
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,000
dominant strains mm-hmm this one just

632
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:03,920
has like the end gorgeous thank you this

633
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,809
so far is my proudest grow in this

634
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,820
garden but wait until you see the next

635
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,649
couple runs I'm already impressed but I

636
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,980
prefer these indica dominant flowers to

637
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,019
sit you down chill you out cushy piney

638
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,579
dank flavored flowers I'm gonna roll a

639
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,710
joint with that and I'm gonna smoke it

640
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:20,990
and it's just gonna taste earthy and

641
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,970
funky and coffee like but then when it

642
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,859
comes to my dad's if you notice all my

643
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,509
dab selection everything over here is

644
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:28,490
like candy flavors and should I like the

645
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,779
cactus cooler and over here this one

646
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,269
doesn't even have a label anymore

647
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,799
whatever that was we got some of the

648
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:36,109
blue sure but course the solvent list we

649
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,549
got super lemon haze over here this one

650
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,449
is cold treat cush cuz obviously like

651
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,430
those cush Terps

652
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,830
I've been going super heavy citrus

653
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,509
lately for a while the only exceptions

654
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,539
the durbin which is all pine I was

655
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:49,849
building up to the lemon G hahaha

656
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:52,159
there's nothing like lemon G Terps the

657
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:54,799
flavor of lemon G live resin in my face

658
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,630
like if I could all if I can only dabble

659
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,190
and I don't know the lemon do you would

660
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,510
be my one and only but if I had to pick

661
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,279
three strains that I had had to dab for

662
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,170
the rest of my life lemon G would be in

663
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,609
that mix I may have to replace it with

664
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,110
lemon Geoffrey though I'm not sure I'd

665
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,269
have to set him side-by-side dick tabs

666
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:10,939
think about that no I've been going

667
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,349
sweet for a while I'm usually good it's

668
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,059
been a few Lee for a while and I just

669
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:16,819
went all sweet the last six months you

670
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:20,000
like the fuel yep it's that heavy diesel

671
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:20,549
flavor I've loved since nearly 2000 dad

672
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,990
for me

673
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,639
is that in your dabs or your flowers

674
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,579
both okay

675
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,850
I'm you know me I love the Sour Diesel

676
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:31,379
yeah yeah Sour Diesel live residents so

677
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,779
tasty I've got a little home right now I

678
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,700
can treat myself with I don't enjoy Sour

679
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,930
Diesel concentrates at all remember what

680
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,700
time I ended up with some sour diesel

681
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:43,470
concentrates on accident I'm pretty sure

682
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,390
I ended up yeah yeah it was delicious

683
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,490
just don't care for that flavor also

684
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,720
good I saved I used it as treats for

685
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,339
like when I did [ __ ] around the house

686
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
that I didn't want to do it all I hate

687
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,289
to say then live residence some kanji or

688
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,299
some Jilly bean Deb's oh god I'm a

689
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,980
junkie bro I've got some strap and then

690
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,649
a live resident oh that's really good

691
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,660
strawberry strawberry banana tangi the

692
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,580
SBT brother everybody seems to be going

693
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,320
googoo over the strawberry banana tangi

694
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,789
stuff from Crockett shots at rocket for

695
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,419
makin killer killer seeds

696
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,649
it's funny how being a breeder and

697
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,539
somebody that works in a large scale

698
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,540
cultivation facility seeing the

699
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,920
difference in buds that are grown in

700
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,690
plants that are grown for flower

701
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,150
production and plants that are grown

702
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:27,240
specifically for oil production we've

703
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,410
got to cut that we gave it to somebody

704
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,730
in another state and they grew it and

705
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,680
once they grew it out and saw it they're

706
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,660
like [ __ ] this plant and they cut down

707
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,789
all of the remaining plants of it and

708
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,830
they sent the flowers to an extraction

709
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,329
lab and that extraction lab was like

710
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:44,099
what the [ __ ] did you send us

711
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:46,369
I'd like some cuts that we got from our

712
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:48,839
friends in Colorado that would be me and

713
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:51,599
they're like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]

714
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,889
and the extraction lab ran it and they

715
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,029
called the guy up like bro you gotta

716
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,560
come over here and the dude went over

717
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,240
there he took a DAB it's the best

718
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,829
[ __ ] hash I've ever smoked and like

719
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,539
this is the best hash anyone in this

720
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:04,199
[ __ ] building has ever smoked do you

721
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,579
have any more he cut down all of the

722
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,400
[ __ ] plants that he had luckily I

723
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:12,500
still have it so it's still around it's

724
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,940
still here but it's it's ugly

725
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,720
conversation today we live in the future

726
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,930
here forget it so often here therefore

727
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,809
the rest of the country and for for sure

728
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,730
the rest of the world when it comes to

729
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,369
legal cannabis products or cannabis

730
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,140
products period we have stuff that I

731
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:32,789
mean if you guys want legal yesterday

732
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,570
you wouldn't see for five years

733
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:38,279
right this legend takes that kind of

734
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,109
time this [ __ ] strain will not finish

735
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,759
for anything and it's ugly but it makes

736
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,719
the best oil bro so things are gonna

737
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,250
change you're gonna start seeing

738
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,390
different different types of plants

739
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,799
growing for different things we're

740
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,450
growing specific should if they grow

741
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,690
right now they will only be made into

742
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,490
oil

743
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,019
we've got transit I will never let

744
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,670
anybody see that flower because they're

745
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:58,829
ugly as [ __ ] but the oil that comes out

746
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:00,840
of it is tremendous we're good through a

747
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:03,449
while now the hash has been stalled out

748
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,149
it just wax and shatter and butter and

749
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:09,150
butters just basically wax you you kind

750
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,960
of stumbled over if I'm not mistaken and

751
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:15,480
maybe I'm wrong for butter lovers sorry

752
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,299
but that was it and then live resident

753
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,769
came along and people really started

754
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,529
thinking about where can we go max with

755
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:25,019
this yeah and I love that people started

756
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:28,079
playing with co2 oil because there's a

757
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,940
huge demand for that but then you're

758
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,919
left with this goo in a syringe that's

759
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,380
impossible right soon without the date

760
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,720
is there I used to hate co2 oil I was

761
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,210
like I hate that goopy [ __ ] but it

762
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,829
didn't taste right now cleaned it um and

763
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,940
it's now that they've cleaned it up the

764
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,460
taste is pretty good

765
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,370
yeah um and when it's further refined

766
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,230
like this or separated completely and

767
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:51,509
then you reconstitute it back on with

768
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,849
your desk like do-it-yourself style it's

769
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,859
a lot of fun it is a lot of fun mixing

770
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,240
cocktails for yourself I like I've been

771
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,059
just taking this shatter and dunking it

772
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,370
straight into the Terps all night um

773
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:05,970
it's a long expensive process you guys

774
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,199
don't even want to know um but the

775
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,990
equipment alone you could buy a house

776
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,920
just for the nice ones yeah yeah just

777
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:17,029
for the equipment but this isn't the

778
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,650
only variety I've seen there's a local

779
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:22,950
outfit that's been bringing samples by

780
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:27,570
and their first two samples were epic

781
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,279
fails like unmarketable unsellable not

782
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:31,589
unsmoked bull way better than [ __ ]

783
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,720
you're gonna get in Florida did the name

784
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:38,039
of the company have a family member in

785
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,289
the name of the company okay but um it

786
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,779
was just not at all good good

787
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:44,980
concentrate ready to go like nothing

788
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:47,779
about it was was solid

789
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,140
attempts three and four were were really

790
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:53,769
really nice final products that are

791
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:57,470
probably gonna be really popular nice

792
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:59,720
but I'm seeing a lot of that there's

793
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,490
products that we get people who ask him

794
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,980
by name and stuff and like I don't have

795
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,019

807
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,830
resin that's why it's fresh frozen you

808
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,170
didn't even dab in your coffin you just

809
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:38,149
thinkin hit me rent I was looking at the

810
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,470
hash refresh frozen material out we

811
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,030
chopped down a plant we cut it into

812
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,370
small buds we throw those buds into

813
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,690
freezer bags those freezer bags go

814
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,389
directly into the freezer they get

815
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,150
frozen immediately then we run to the

816
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,070
store and get bags of ice and put those

817
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,320
bags of ice into a giant cooler put that

818
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:56,869
frozen material into that cooler drive

819
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,299
that to a location where it is then

820
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,609
turned in to live resin at that point we

821
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:04,519
can have it turned into live SAP live

822
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:07,189
sugar we can almost get a live shatter

823
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:14,210
from some of the strains the Sour Diesel

824
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:15,769
won't live shatter yeah once you build a

825
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,059
relationship with the extraction company

826
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,220
you're working with we have two specific

827
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,720
extractors that we talk to a lot they

828
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,009
work with tur packs and we can tell them

829
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,690
what we want and they like that strains

830
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:25,879
not gonna do that or that strain is

831
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,799
gonna do that and so we know that we can

832
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,380
get triangle killer sugar and Rudeboy

833
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:33,169
SAP like on consistent levels the

834
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,540
Rudeboy Live resin sugar is one of my

835
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,460
favorite [ __ ] things to dab ever it

836
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,680

840
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:45,649
feel on the shoulders this Rudeboy hits

841
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,930
me right in the eyes and in the forehead

842
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,480
and it makes me film it makes math

843
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:53,150
skills go away it just makes me Goofy's

844

want cookies after I smoke that [ __ ]

846
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,719
yeah all right so it is the 7:10

847
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:01,970
you guys we've been talking about 7:10

848
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,110
for a whole long time we should talk

849
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:09,350
about the origin of 7:10 Mike you have

850
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:10,998
any idea where the number 17 what all

851
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:13,158
this culture part of this community is

852
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:15,169
you flip it up upside down and I suppose

853
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,549
that oil that is true that's because a

854
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,710
lot of the people that started this

855
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:22,099
movement were of the age where they had

856
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,558
beepers and that's about as far as I've

857
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:26,480
bothered to follow it all right so 710

858
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,638
is the new 420 my friend Adam mill

859
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,829
coined the phrase 710 is the new 420

860
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,359
back in the day it was all about 420

861
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,428
let's get together at 420 and smoke some

862
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:37,548
weed now at 7:10 let's get together 710

863
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:41,090
take some dabs if you turn 7/10 upside

864
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:43,849
down it does say oil ah to the best of

865
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:46,339
my knowledge task rock is the person

866
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:48,319
that created the phrase 710 I think task

867
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,118
rock and a couple other guys were either

868
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,319
in a chat or on a conference call and

869
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,459
they were talking about stuff we need

870
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,138
they were like we need something a

871
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,999
little more bougie than 420 let's

872
00:31:54,138 --> 00:32:00,079
upgrade it let's do it with the hash

873
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:02,480
well this was hash kids were separating

874
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,788
from flower kids kind of yeah yeah say

875
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,980
that my kids I mean like full-grown

876
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:10,429
adults but you know what I mean right

877
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,579
The Hustler kids so that's that's where

878
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:15,379
7/10 came from 7-10 was coined as far as

879
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:16,668
I know to the best of my knowledge and

880
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:18,319
I've done a little bit of research but

881
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:21,019
task rock and a couple other cats were

882
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,970
the guys that coined the phrase 7/10 so

883
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:26,509
they created 710 shot at the task rock

884
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,339
cast Rock of course is he's a rapper TAS

885
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,868
Brock has a couple of albums out one of

886
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:31,459
my favorite songs is probably first

887
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:34,128
place I like do it again

888
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,579
of course boil that oil he also does

889
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:39,048
hits from the nail and tax blah hash

890
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,548
hash related music I love to listen to

891
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:41,929
some tasks and take some dads or get

892
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:43,759
dabbed out and drive around and listen

893
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,100
to some tasks away I did not like they

894
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,389
didn't say that hypothetically I would

895
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,509
like to get dabbed out and driver as a

896
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:52,998
passenger and listen to tasks

897
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:56,419
[ __ ] tasks Rock is also the founder

898
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:58,159
proprietor this the dude for a

899
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,350
highly-educated titanium that's task

900
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,179
rock a lot of the times if you go to a

901
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:03,048
cannabis cup event in California

902
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,879
Colorado

903
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:07,308
those are probably the ones he goes to

904
00:33:04,878 --> 00:33:08,990
if you go to those Cannabis Cup events

905
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:10,220
and you go to the highly educated booth

906
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,109
to purchase some highly educated

907
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,360
products you were probably going to pay

908
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:16,459
your money to task rock directly he will

909
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,798
be the dude there that helps ya so task

910
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,450
is integral in the 7:10 community

911
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:21,650
integral in the 7:10 movement he's been

912
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,870
a big part of it since the beginning

913
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,820
he's a huge supporter shot at the task

914
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,979
has made up the number 7/10 not the

915
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:29,599
number but the phrase 7:10 and that mic

916
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,349
stands kind of it might need a little

917
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,419
bit I just might get droopy we had a

918
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:37,159
quick equipment they might be done you

919
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,630
might just have to hold it you might

920
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,970

924
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:01,309
oh boy task Rock 710 is a new 4:20 shot

925
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:05,329
at the animal without task rock I don't

926
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:07,399
know and Big D is the person that gave

927
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:09,529
me my very first dab so I want to give a

928
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,450
shout out to Big D at the time he was

929
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,700
with Broadway wellness he moved on to be

930
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,158
top shelf extracts Big D moved on to be

931
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,199
the founder and proprietor of the secret

932
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,878
cup not the secret session the secret

933
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,460
cup the one with the dragon in the logo

934
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,190
the first hash competition I think I

935
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,829
ever attended I ever heard about yeah

936
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,590
yeah so I think task

937
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:32,119
I think Big D I think Adam Hill the guys

938
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,320
from health stone glass and of course

939
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,059
I'm gonna give a little bit of credit to

940
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,859
hitman glass dougie because he does make

941
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:39,049
the rigs that a lot of us are purchasing

942
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:41,019
and smoking and hash through so a lot of

943
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:46,550
those guys are pioneers of the industry

944
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:49,608
old-school folks in Colorado ah and the

945
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,929
hash movement Spence did a lot I want to

946
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:54,079
give a huge shout out to Spence in the

947
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,760
garden weed and Cru kind bill that whole

948
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,059
crew they did a lot in the hash but

949
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,180
honestly we all owe a huge high-five -

950
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:03,559
Derrick Cummings [ __ ] Derrick that dude

951
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:05,029
did so much for hash I know that's why

952
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,130
it's an inside joke but hash tag [ __ ]

953
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:10,070
Derrick just kind of an inside joke with

954
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,440
all of his friends but Derrick did a lot

955
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,670
for learning about hash Derrick did a

956
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,530
lot of research and learned a whole lot

957
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,630
of [ __ ] and then of course there's Tony

958
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,769
V there's a whole bunch of guys doing

959
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,510
stuff for hash in Terps

960
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:23,300
but shad it's all the people that helped

961

many people involved in keeping it as

966
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,739
what it is today um it's been fun to

967
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,000
watch it grow it goes so rapidly but now

968
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:40,339
that it's legal that we can do whatever

969
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,650
we want with this the equipment the

970
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,030
products have just every couple months I

971
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,740
got to go buy all-new [ __ ] just to have

972
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,440
what I need to have what to be on top of

973
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:49,639
things it's like any other tech right

974
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,760
now every six months

975
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:55,639
it evolves two to three times faster and

976
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,650
more effective than it was before the

977
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,359
Terps will avail themselves every part

978
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,119
of the legal marijuana industry which is

979
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,769
fun to watch we got a huge variety

980
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,109
products about a year and a half ago

981
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:10,639
they're all getting really really really

982
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:12,620
good now um it's just so much fun to see

983
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,329
you guys gotta legalize it where you

984
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,289
live

985
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:16,730
remember when I was like the only one

986
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:20,480
that had little jars of Terps on the

987
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,920
table you probably for a while there's a

988
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,159
lot of people out there now they're

989
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,340
available at a lot of shops eating them

990
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:29,690
up eating them up it's I really it's a

991
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,860
whole new thing I really love it

992
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:37,250
a lot of people are probably like with

993
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:40,220
the [ __ ] Terps ah are the compounds

994
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,949
that mainly provide the flavor and aroma

995
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:47,149
to your cannabis and or cannabis

996
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:48,679
concentrates they are they're part of

997
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,030
the flavor the Paley it's and the esters

998
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,289
have a lot to do with the flavor the

999
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,940
flavonoids have a lot to do with the

1000
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:55,279
flavor obviously but the terpenoids are

1001
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,530
mainly what play the part of the flavor

1002
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,730
that work on your tongue that's mostly

1003
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,670
the part that you get they also

1004
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,170
contribute to your high I think that the

1005
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,059
OG Kush one makes me a little more

1006
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,590
mellow it gives me a body thing it kind

1007
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,360
of makes my body go won't won't won't

1008
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,600
won't won't and the ghost train haze

1009
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,700
makes my head go like I just dabbed a

1010
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,000
[ __ ] bottle rocket well essentially

1011
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:18,619
that's what separates indica from sativa

1012
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,889
is what you've refined into that tiny

1013
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:25,579
little jar it's everything around the

1014
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:29,119
THC there's there's some other stuff

1015
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:31,639
that goes into that but yeah it's it if

1016
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,799
you had to describe somebody to somebody

1017
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,119
you had to show them strongly this is

1018
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,830
the difference between indica and sativa

1019
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,329
that would definitely be a good way to

1020
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,509
do it just take that the

1021
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:43,610
to drive as a heavy sativa was a heavy

1022
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,950
annika oh you're way too high watch try

1023
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,349
this one just put him to bed with the OG

1024
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:49,549
Kush know if their problem was I'm Way

1025
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,920
too high I wouldn't give them another

1026
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:54,730
dad no I'd give them a dab of silly CB

1027
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,760
have ya some CBD

1028
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:00,619
cherry flavor but alright all this talk

1029
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,990
about dads has got me wanna dad so I've

1030
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:04,400
got some of this mob boss shatter and

1031
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,469
I've dumped it into some ghost train

1032
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,789
haze Terps you can see the Terps on the

1033
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:10,129
tip of the dab it just looks like a

1034
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:12,230
little wet spot on there I'm gonna take

1035
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,610

1042
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,340
colors right now it's gonna be beautiful

1043
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:36,829
you can turn colors without choking I

1044
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:39,679
see now he's pasty white now he's going

1045
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:48,259
to red it's a proper set purple here in

1046
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:50,269
a couple seconds of feeling oh it tastes

1047
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,220
amazing it's just like heaven I've

1048
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:54,500
always described haze strains and the

1049
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:55,459
ghost train haze is really it definitely

1050
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,170
stands out for what I'm talking about

1051
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,269
there's like a velvet thing that happens

1052
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,500
on your tongue it just feels like like

1053
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,449
you know when you smell while Acts or

1054
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,059
lavender if there's that specific thing

1055
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:06,799
there's I it almost has a similar

1056
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:08,360
coating like that that happens but it's

1057
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,269
more enjoyable to me because I [ __ ]

1058
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,070
hate lilacs and lavender I don't like

1059
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:14,630
the smell that [ __ ] makes my nose feel

1060
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,610
like I got particles in my nose yes I

1061
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,070
like lavender what I'm surprised with it

1062
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,870
like if we check into a hotel off just

1063
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,480
get up to the room and it's all over

1064
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,859
drives me [ __ ] nuts yeah there's

1065
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,389
probably worth [ __ ] in that hotel rooms

1066
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,010
in that lab in there bro no I know but

1067
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:29,989
it's still avender that I've like choked

1068
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,990
on and can feel in my mouth for like the

1069
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:34,849
next hour like it's it definitely has a

1070
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:37,579
coating I I don't know maybe we're just

1071
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:39,170
equally high alright

1072
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,130
shout out to 7/10 shot at the task

1073
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,349
there's something else I want to talk

1074
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,829
about on this episode that is not really

1075
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:49,279
dabbe related not really 710 related but

1076
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:51,980
it needs to be mentioned amendment 139

1077
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,630
current event pom pom pom

1078
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,250
there was a group I don't know exactly

1079
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,920
who put this petition out there was a

1080
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,050
group that was petitioning to limit all

1081
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,460
cannabis products to 16 percent THC

1082
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,619
that's right the buds that we grow at

1083
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,300
the agreement healthy wellness this

1084
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,300
should test anywhere from 20 to 30

1085
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:15,560
percent THC nothing is lower than 22 I

1086
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:18,650
wouldn't guess the average THC content

1087
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:22,460
in Colorado's 18 really who the [ __ ] is

1088
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,470
growing that [ __ ] no there's actually a

1089
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:28,159
pretty solid demand for stuff that's

1090
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:31,279
between like 12 and 16 percent people

1091
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,349
that retired after 35 hours doing [ __ ]

1092
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,510
they were drug tested for they really

1093
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,659
don't want our our moonshine potency

1094
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,280
weed they freak out when they try to

1095
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:43,608
roll join up and smoke it like they did

1096
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,830
back and put that [ __ ] around but they

1097
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:47,869
did they like the whole like pass it

1098
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:49,819
back and forth with you there why for a

1099
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:51,350
while I have a friend who rents yes so

1100
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,390
they they like stuff that they can smoke

1101
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,608
on a list have it burn and what he's

1102
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:58,989
writing yeah so there is a call for that

1103
00:40:55,608 --> 00:41:01,099
but the average is is 18 and so the

1104
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:02,689
estimates are that this should have shut

1105
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,069
down 80 percent of the industry as we

1106
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,869
know right now I wouldn't want it I

1107
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,970
would move to a place where I could grow

1108
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:09,829
high quality cannabis well know

1109
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:13,489
immediately all conscience rates gone

1110
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:16,279
most of the edibles gone most of the

1111
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:19,489
strains we could've gone most of the

1112
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,810
vapor cartridges gone like what's the

1113
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:23,839
point of a vapor cart

1114
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,559
that's 16 percent that would feel the

1115
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,809
black-market

1116
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:32,090
so well yep and that's the design is the

1117
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:35,000
people that were behind it wanted it to

1118
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:37,430
kill the industry they know that a

1119
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,579
public vote to and amendment 64

1120
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:46,129
statewide would die laughably and so

1121
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:47,900
this was their more reasonable attempt

1122
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,090
to give voters to go along with gutting

1123
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,980
the industry so there were three parts

1124
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,470
to this they were gonna add childproof

1125
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,119
packaging which we already do they

1126
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:58,159
wanted us to add a health warning that

1127
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,010
said this root causes like a reparable

1128
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,329
brain damage or some [ __ ] look that we

1129
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,670
already do health warnings that are

1130
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,798
reasonable

1131
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,809
we're willing to add more reasonable

1132
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:09,489
health warnings but we're not really

1133
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:12,670
glad some random [ __ ] did you just

1134
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:16,150
thought up and then it was gonna limit

1135
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:18,278
potency to 16% the group behind this

1136
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,849
claims they have 80% of the public

1137
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:25,028
support on this but what public where

1138
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:28,088
that they won't tell you but they're

1139
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:28,719
pretty sure didn't didn't ask any dad

1140
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,429
kids

1141
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,469
I think it's 80% of the people at the

1142
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:34,838
last anti-pot meeting yeah

1143
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:42,420
but 80% of the people in Parker that's

1144
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:44,978
just from shout out to my hometown they

1145
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,099
they really really want hate marijuana

1146
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:49,298
and they wanted to shut us down this way

1147
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,690
they claim they have a huge amount of

1148
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:56,170
support which is nonsense they they

1149
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,519
withdrew their effort today they they

1150
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,338
essentially said they'd give a stop

1151
00:42:57,518 --> 00:43:03,458
trying and the reason they stopped

1152
00:43:00,338 --> 00:43:07,380
trying is kind of funny they claimed

1153
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:09,969
that the group of marijuana industry

1154
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,969
supporters and businesses that form to

1155
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:15,130
oppose this effort called up all of the

1156
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:16,599
petitions signature-gathering companies

1157
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,999
in Colorado that are good at what they

1158
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,269
do and can actually get a statewide

1159
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:23,468
ballot effort on the signatures

1160
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:25,598
collected because it's like a hundred

1161
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:28,958
thousand or 98 thousand signatures it's

1162
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,459
a lot there are companies in Colorado

1163
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,528
they can definitely get that done for

1164
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,969
you apparently they all got a phone call

1165
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,739
from the Marijuana people like we're

1166
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:40,679
gonna hire you for this here's what you

1167
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:44,228
gotta do nothing go ahead and Bill us

1168
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:46,268
and just hung up the phone and they

1169
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:47,948
raised enough money to apparently make

1170
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:49,478
that offer to the two biggest companies

1171
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:51,759
the three biggest companies in Colorado

1172
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:53,078
and on the off chance the anti pop

1173
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:54,900
people tried to hire all three they were

1174
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,249
prepared to pay all three to do nothing

1175
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,798
and so the anti pop people were like

1176
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:02,228
wolf we have [ __ ] do this ourselves

1177
00:43:58,798 --> 00:44:04,059
let's go ahead and not do it nice which

1178
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:05,468
makes me laugh especially when they're

1179
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:07,239
like well we have at eighty percent

1180
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:09,519
support of the public oh my god then

1181
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:11,170
it's so easy you just they kind of

1182
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:12,998
played old-school drug dealer tactics

1183
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:16,900
though I like that you just pop it up on

1184
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:17,469
Facebook and you say hey community that

1185
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,119
support

1186
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:20,618
this so much we need all of you to grab

1187
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,700
a signature and take it to work the next

1188
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:26,800
day and say hey sign this the 80% of put

1189
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:29,439
it's just such nonsense

1190
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,730
yeah they didn't have 80% you know and

1191
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,070
then they claimed that the marijuana

1192
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,039
industry raised tens and millions of

1193
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:38,349
millions of dollars to do this and the

1194
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:40,329
digits public all you have to do is know

1195
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:42,340
where to Google and you can check how

1196
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:44,108
much they raise it's like for sad part

1197
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,760
is that if you hand in a petition to

1198
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:47,920
most people and you're like hey would

1199
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,780
you like to limit the THC in cannabis to

1200
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,950
16% I don't even [ __ ] that mean sure no

1201
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:58,119
they decide like stop bugging me it's

1202
00:44:55,949 --> 00:45:00,909
ringing that [ __ ] Bell if I sign this

1203
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,230
yep yeah that's sucks that people are

1204
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:03,368
just willing to sign [ __ ] too without

1205
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,400
even knowing what they're talking about

1206
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:08,619
well and by law you have to print the

1207
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,539
actual language that you're asking

1208
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,670
people to sign for across the top of the

1209
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:15,070
sheet they sign it can't be a separate

1210
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,559
page or nothing like it's there's a lot

1211
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,090
of rules a lot of them we've we've

1212
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,130

1213
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:25,300

and trying to get people to give a [ __ ]

1217
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:31,539
no one reads it yeah they're just a

1218
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:32,379
[ __ ] hurry they want to sign it get

1219

got dropped it did not pass you guys

1224
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:49,509
they because you know the group behind

1225
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:52,990
it is has pledged to reform as a broader

1226
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,920
coalition of people uniting to [ __ ] over

1227
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:55,539
the marijuana industry

1228
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,940
it just sounds like a whole bunch of

1229
00:45:55,539 --> 00:46:00,789
[ __ ] bunch of big words that there's

1230
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,769
a lawyer type for them the funny part is

1231
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:04,358
is a big part of their press release

1232
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:06,608
today they're like well this former high

1233
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:09,880
school principal who was who was behind

1234
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:11,799
this said this and this this the local

1235
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,930
parent who's behind the other person

1236
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,580
behind this said this and I'm sitting

1237
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:17,679
there reading a press release from a

1238
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,259
major anti marijuana personality in

1239
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,569
Oregon and the press release talks about

1240
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,520
major funding from a national anti

1241
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,170
marijuana group and then if you keep

1242
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,389
reading the article it talks about the

1243
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,720
actual people behind the initiative who

1244
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,849
are

1245
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,429
these local lovable characters like a

1246
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:36,009
teacher and a parent

1247
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:38,019
their major politicians from around the

1248
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:41,080
country who make a living doing stuff

1249
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:42,789
like this but they're able to portrayed

1250
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,799
is like oh there's there's just these

1251
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:47,230
little folks being picked on by big

1252
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,630
industry marijuana that's like do you

1253
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,789
threatened a billion-dollar industry and

1254
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,309
they raised 300 grand to knock you out

1255
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:56,050
of the fight like come on now so you

1256
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:57,880
just gave me a perfect segue before we

1257
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,320
start wrapping up the show give me an

1258
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,230
update on what is going on with the

1259
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,330
effort to eliminate and/or eradicate

1260
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:08,469
recreational cannabis from Pueblo County

1261
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:11,500
ok so locally our petition effort has

1262
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:14,469
been significantly more successful than

1263
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,150
the one statewide I there have all their

1264
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:17,679
signatures turned in it looks like

1265
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,380
they've got more than enough valid

1266
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,899
signatures to make the ballot there's

1267
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,690
two questions in front of the courts

1268
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,250
right now the first question is how many

1269
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,880
signatures they should have collected

1270
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:33,219
they collected 5% of the voter

1271
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,640
signatures from that last election down

1272
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:39,849
here which was like 5,000 signatures

1273
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:43,480
they collected 9,000 almost and so

1274
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:46,000
they're covered there if it's 5% but

1275
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,579
recently a bill was passed at the state

1276
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,050
level requiring this specific question

1277
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:54,250
if it's going to be put on a ballot

1278
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:57,280
anywhere to have 15% of passed voter

1279
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:01,329
signatures which would Jack that number

1280
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,010
to around 14 or 15,000 which means they

1281
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:04,599
don't have near enough signatures

1282
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,090
gathered and they need to get back out

1283
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:10,839
there and gather signatures that

1284
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:13,480
decision should come any day now well

1285
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,660
it's Friday when we're recording this

1286
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,690
it'll be Sunday when it comes out so

1287
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:21,369
it'll probably be within four or five

1288
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,470
days of this coming out when we get that

1289
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,029
decision hopefully maybe as many as 15

1290
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:29,849
but if your roster said this will be

1291
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,850
Monday because he's from the future mace

1292
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:34,500
but hopefully within seven or ten days

1293
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:36,179
we get we get that first decision about

1294
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,699
how what what percentage of the vote

1295
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,710
they should have gathered odds are

1296
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:42,409
strong that the judge is gonna rule that

1297
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,059
5% is fine

1298
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:49,019
recently we had a local politician make

1299
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:51,210
a primary ballot and the it ended up in

1300
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:53,550
front of the same judge and the judge's

1301
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,650
ruling was yes he failed to follow the

1302
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:58,200
law here and here yes he broke that rule

1303
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,180
there but elections are about choices

1304
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:02,789
and why not give you guys him as one of

1305
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:06,899
those choices and a lot of people were

1306
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:10,050
like wait what really but kinda I guess

1307
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:14,039
like the judge gets to make the rules

1308
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:15,900
that's why they wear the outfit it's why

1309
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:18,059
they have the job so let them make them

1310
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,440
and that was the decision they made so

1311
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,230
we're kind of expecting the same thing

1312
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,269
here there's another court issue that

1313
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,360
involves some serious campaign finance

1314
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:30,840
stuff that could really keep them off

1315
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,940
about Colorado and pretty much every

1316
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,809
state in the Union has very serious laws

1317
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,849
that govern their elections when you

1318
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:41,070
would like to put something on an

1319
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:43,019
official election ballot there are rules

1320
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,850
you must follow the anti marijuana

1321
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,789
people down here are terrible at

1322
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:50,309
following rules

1323
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:53,519
it's a very fun character trait for them

1324
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:55,679
to have if you're me so as soon as they

1325
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,480
said they were running a public ballot I

1326
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,819
was hoping for well like with nothing

1327
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,320
complicated there's a lot of important

1328
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,110
in ins and outs and if you can't handle

1329
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,990
a licensing hearing at the county level

1330
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:10,170
running a countywide ballot issue is

1331
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:13,799
probably gonna trip you up and it looks

1332
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,539
like it has one of the things is you

1333
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,640
can't raise money in a jar at a

1334
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:20,909
fundraiser that's not a thing in

1335
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,529
politics if this donations over $20 I

1336
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:25,379
gotta get your name I got your serial

1337
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:27,570
number and that's just how elections go

1338
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,349
the money is tracked like that unless

1339
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:33,150
you're super rich and by which case you

1340
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:34,529
didn't but you can donate hundreds of

1341
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,470
millions of dollars to a company to run

1342
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,519
evil attack ads and [ __ ] and that's fine

1343
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:40,169
but if you're a little guy trying to

1344
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:41,909
give twenty four dollars you got to give

1345
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,869
me your name it's your serial number you

1346
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,969
can't just throw

1347
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,769
on the piano and at the end of the night

1348
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:49,199
have three hundred or a thousand bucks

1349
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:52,949
in there and call it good enough so they

1350
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,579
did that twice and then there's major

1351
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:58,739
polling that they've bragged about and

1352
00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:00,929
most people don't understand what what

1353
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:03,000
kind of money's involved when you're you

1354
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:05,039
when you poll people in a county like

1355
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,059
Pueblo we're not a big County there's

1356
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,699
only a hundred fifty thousand people

1357
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,980
down here a poll like that still costs

1358
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:13,889
ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thousand

1359
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,949
dollars the good ones cost twenty-five

1360
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:18,420
thirty-five forty thousand dollars the

1361
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:21,210
ones that'll really give you the

1362
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,680
information you want are expensive they

1363
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,809
did one of these they paid for one of

1364
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,779
these we know all about it and for some

1365
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:29,369
reason I'm lying about it that's gonna

1366
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,190
play out really interestingly in court

1367
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:35,039
do we have access to the truth on those

1368
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,470
surveys we we don't know what the

1369
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,059
results they got back but we know they

1370
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,759
bragged about them enough to the local

1371
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:44,130
hospitals for the local hospitals to put

1372
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,680
literature together that involved heard

1373
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,840
that referenced this the polling done we

1374
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,440
know who did the poll we know who paid

1375
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,880
for the poll we know who probably got

1376
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,079
handed the check that paid for the poll

1377
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,550
we know who probably cashed it it's

1378
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,569
disturbing that they're lying about it

1379
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,160
all I had to do is put it on the

1380
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:05,610
campaign finance report and nobody gives

1381
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,719
you [ __ ] but they didn't and then they

1382
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:09,360
keep claiming to the press that they

1383
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:12,179
didn't and eventually the judge is gonna

1384
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,650
want to know why and that's an issue

1385
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:14,940
that could keep him off the ballot -

1386
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,680
same thing with the money in the jars

1387
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,139
that's a big enough screw up to keep you

1388
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:22,289
off the ballot um if you want to make

1389
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:25,199
law you got to follow law it's really

1390
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:27,119
that simple did they hire a lawyer they

1391
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,889
did it's their main volunteer he's

1392
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,139
donated like ten or twelve thousand

1393
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:34,079
dollars worth of lawyer hours to their

1394
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:35,909
effort it's like six hours I have no

1395
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,569
idea what he charges but that's on that

1396
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:41,099
campaign finance reports well okay I've

1397
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:44,789
spent it a disturbing amount of time

1398
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:47,610
going through those reports um it's fun

1399
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:48,779
to work on campaigns I'm sure they look

1400
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:51,539
on your face when you talk about it's

1401
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:54,060
great it's it's fun it's I mean it's

1402
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,900
very could very well could be the death

1403
00:52:54,059 --> 00:53:00,329
of webelo like yeah yeah really can't

1404
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,760
handle the loss this would be to our

1405
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:05,789
community we were on the edge for a

1406
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,640
while parts of town are still very very

1407
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:10,259
bad crime is a huge problem

1408
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:13,079
infrastructure spending is a huge

1409
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:15,210
problem if we lose 60% of our

1410
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,029
construction industry 1300 marijuana

1411
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:19,740
jobs all of the expansion that industry

1412
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,830
is supposed to go through over the next

1413
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:26,189
several years all of that real estate

1414
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:28,710
floods back on the market like that's a

1415
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,070
death blow all those people that moved

1416
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:34,050
here because somebody like myself had a

1417
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,100
job and was like I need a helper and I

1418
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,870
got somebody that I know in another

1419
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:38,699
state that I trust brought them out here

1420
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:41,069
those people and myself would be [ __ ]

1421
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:42,869
you'd be [ __ ] well there's a huge note

1422
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,930
where people weren't five people that

1423
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:47,190
moved here within the last year yeah how

1424
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:50,639
many people are employed by the spot

1425
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:54,800
like 3035 yeah that's one dispensary how

1426
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,799
many of them are there in Pueblo West

1427
00:53:55,369 --> 00:54:01,710
hundred licenses it's 1,300 people it's

1428
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,090
it literally if this vote passes

1429
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,699
thirteen other people are out of work

1430
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,579
it's a full 1% of our population down

1431
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:11,099
here you add that immediately to the

1432
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:13,110
unemployment rolls and then you compound

1433
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:15,960
that with all of it's not like I got

1434
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,220
fired for stealing its thirteen hundred

1435
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,070
people got put out of a work as an

1436
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:23,279
industry closed we no one gets to apply

1437
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,990
for the job I just lost all of us are

1438
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,730
now applying for whatever jobs we're

1439
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:28,289
currently available when our industry

1440
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:30,360
shut down what percentage of those

1441
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:31,440
people go home and buy a bunch of

1442
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,849
[ __ ] lights with their first

1443
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,320
unemployment check and build a black

1444
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:35,130
market grow and start flipping a black

1445
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,920
market weed

1446
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,539
well that's I mean I figure half of what

1447
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,030
we do about twenty million in annual

1448
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,829
sales down here I figure half of that

1449
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,110
immediately goes back into the black

1450
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:47,699
market and the other half goes either up

1451
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,300
the highway to Colorado Springs or down

1452
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:53,549
the how to turn at the tourist money

1453
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,110
goes to Trinidad and manna to the

1454
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,030
medical money goes to Colorado Springs

1455
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:59,010
everybody who doesn't feel like that's

1456
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:01,019
effort worth putting in for a bag of

1457
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,210
weed just goes back to the black market

1458
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:05,210
yeah just put some seeds in the dirt in

1459
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,440
the basement some lights on that [ __ ]

1460
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:08,548
we lose out on five million in tax

1461
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,739
revenue

1462
00:55:08,548 --> 00:55:12,358
like that's paying for all kinds of cool

1463
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,769
[ __ ] that wasn't getting paid for before

1464
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:15,088
because we didn't have the money the

1465
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,618
city's starting to look decent it's

1466
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:18,328
clean it's getting cleaned up the

1467
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,880
potholes are going away it's nothing

1468
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:22,949
little by little she's getting more man

1469
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,079
I noticed it the last street I Drive on

1470
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:26,759
on my way to your place it's really just

1471
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,009
got repaid yeah they just repaving the

1472
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:31,259
whole street in Jackson's I've known

1473
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:33,420
about Pueblo yep

1474
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:35,728
that whole Boulevard it's been quite hot

1475
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,579
for potholes if it's working it really

1476
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:40,259
does work it's just little by little it

1477
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,298
takes a minute people are like why has

1478
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:44,608
why are our schools perfect we've had

1479
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:46,048
legal weed for two years why aren't all

1480
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,699
our streets perfect it's been two years

1481
00:55:46,048 --> 00:55:50,278
I just thanks a minute do you have any

1482
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:52,229
info on the scholarship that was awarded

1483
00:55:50,278 --> 00:55:55,858
to the child she and the Prophet doubled

1484
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:57,748
it boom um like if I was king of the

1485
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:01,650
world the scholarship would be bigger

1486
00:55:57,748 --> 00:56:03,118
and spendable in more places but it's

1487
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,249
still really awesome dude we're sending

1488
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,930
25 kids to college that probably

1489
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:08,308
wouldn't be able to go without that two

1490
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:09,629
grand explain a little bit how that

1491
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:12,809
happened to people that have hooked up

1492
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:15,150
at all our county commissioners we

1493
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:17,548
passed the voters passed the local

1494
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,318
excise tax so all of the production when

1495
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:22,278
you grow marijuana and then sell it to a

1496
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:24,989
retail store it gets taxed at that point

1497
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:27,509
and that money goes into kind of a slush

1498
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:31,978
fund for dream projects we couldn't pay

1499
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:33,449
for it before we paid when I grow the

1500
00:56:31,978 --> 00:56:35,728
flowers it green and healthy wellness I

1501
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:39,239
have to they have to be packaged and

1502
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:41,429
then transferred to the store yep that's

1503
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:42,869
where the tax happens yep okay if it was

1504
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:45,028
in Pueblo County that's where the tax

1505
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:48,059
would happen okay Aram when Colorado

1506
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:50,880
Springs passes an excise tax on medical

1507
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,650
event it'll happen there okay but we

1508
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,709
already did that down here for rec and

1509
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:58,528
so that's gonna be this is the first

1510
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:00,268
year that tax has been in effect so

1511
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:01,798
money's just starting to trickle in but

1512
00:57:00,268 --> 00:57:03,629
we expect three and a half million

1513
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:06,059
dollars from that excise tax this year

1514
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:08,068
and that's the bulk of the marijuana

1515
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,920
taxes that Pueblo County is gonna make

1516
00:57:08,068 --> 00:57:13,619
next year we get three point five from

1517
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,389
the excise tax ish it's an estimate so

1518
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,119
far we'll see what how it actually plans

1519
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:23,059
out and then we're definitely gonna get

1520
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:26,809
1.7 1.8 in licensing fees and sales

1521
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:28,608
yeah if the industry exists if it will

1522
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:30,739
know that's that's through the end of

1523
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:33,108
this year so even if the election goes

1524
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,868
against this in November we still get to

1525
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:39,829
operate until next November all right it

1526
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:42,820
was sort of your licenses can expire as

1527
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:47,929
it comes comes up for expiration until

1528
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:52,539
November 2017 so the shop that gets

1529
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:55,849
their license in like November the 1st

1530
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:57,259
of this year is in is in the best shape

1531
00:57:55,849 --> 00:58:00,489
to operate as long as possible

1532
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:05,000
regardless of the election outcome

1533
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:07,250
hopefully that made sense yeah yet it's

1534
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,159
just a deathblow to us it's we're doing

1535
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:14,358
so much with it's not a lot compared to

1536
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:16,579
our whole county budget but the problem

1537
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,380
with our County budget is that it passed

1538
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:21,559
its breaking point a couple million

1539
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,660
dollars ago and we just have to look at

1540
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,190
middle school kids walking in the middle

1541
00:58:23,659 --> 00:58:26,960
of the street with the buses in the car

1542
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:28,970
traffic can go sorry

1543
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:33,079
no money for sidewalks or crossing

1544
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:34,579
guards or crossing guard books yeah like

1545
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:36,769
all kinds of stuff there's we took

1546
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:38,809
asbestos out of a couple of schools and

1547
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:40,489
I read that in the newspaper and I was

1548
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:44,380
like asbestos in schools it's [ __ ]

1549
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:47,239
2016 oh it's hurting my face ow

1550
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:49,010
think about it no that was way down in

1551
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,769
San Juan County because that's how we're

1552
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:54,140
spending that the state also collects an

1553
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:56,329
excise tax in the first 40 million from

1554
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:59,779
that fund goes to school construction

1555
00:58:56,329 --> 00:59:01,699
through our state's best program and the

1556
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,470
best program literally when you apply

1557
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:05,629
for it you explain how your school

1558
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:08,000
districts broke how they've never had

1559
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:09,829
money since the 40s and how you badly

1560
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,150
need to do stuff that should have been

1561
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:13,460
done 30 years ago which you've never

1562
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:16,010
found a way to pay for and so they're

1563
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:18,199
doing stuff like I'm taking the lad out

1564
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:22,100
of the pipes taking the asbestos out of

1565
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:23,929
the gym putting pads in the playground

1566
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:28,849
yeah like or building a playground

1567
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:30,649
period paving the road to it all kinds

1568
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:33,409
of crazy stuff that we really should

1569
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,480
have done decades ago but just never had

1570
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:35,839
the money and we were never gonna have

1571
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,969
it

1572
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,640
and the now we can fund it with weed

1573
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:42,619
money because it's just enough more than

1574
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,809
what we need to do everything else that

1575
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:46,759
wasn't getting funded the Lupus

1576
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:49,400
background of the scholarships so sorry

1577
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:52,660
the scholarships they gave each kid that

1578
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,340
wanted up to 400 kids a thousand bucks

1579
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:58,460
400 kids got a thousand bucks well that

1580
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:01,190
was the offer only 25 ended up applying

1581
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,139
okay um part of the reason for that is

1582
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:05,000
you have to be a Pueblo high school

1583
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:10,730
graduate and we had way more than 25 of

1584
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,820
those dicks and thinking that but you

1585
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:16,010
had to go to college in Pueblo County so

1586
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,990
yeah if I was king the world would be at

1587
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,490
least anywhere in Colorado right cuz

1588
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,319
Nebraska Oni my [ __ ] they just want to

1589
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:22,459
keep the money in the cow dad they just

1590
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,559
wanted to keep it in the county they

1591
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,389
wanted to promote the local university

1592
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,440
and there's a lot of cool things

1593
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,500
happening down here at our local

1594
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,990
university so when I keep it on a good

1595
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,969
music program a good math program but I

1596
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:37,309
don't know about the governor like the

1597
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:39,709
program so much he he used state

1598
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:42,529
marijuana taxes to double it to 2 grand

1599
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:43,159
and I mean honestly that's books for a

1600
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:45,830
whole year

1601
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:49,909
that's meals for for most of a whole

1602
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:51,980
year for happier well depends you well

1603
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:53,599
know I was a college student so some of

1604
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,510
these numbers aren't real unrealistic

1605
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:59,539
that might just be a decade old sorry

1606
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:01,310
but uh I mean $2,000 down here in Pueblo

1607
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:03,440
that's fully the difference between I'm

1608
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:05,869
able to go and I'm not able to go yeah

1609
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,740
and honestly if $2,000 is gonna really

1610
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:11,089
make or break that difference like

1611
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,579
College in New York or wherever else I'd

1612
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:15,140
be happy to send you with that 2 grand

1613
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:17,329
probably wasn't a make or break anyway

1614
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:19,129
right like it requires a lot more to

1615
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:22,130
live out of state than it does in your

1616
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:24,680
hometown yeah you'd still stay with the

1617
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:28,010
fam oh for sure like that was a huge

1618
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:30,589
amount of a huge huge amount yeah but

1619
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:32,330
it's a fantastic program and the

1620
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,550
anti-pop you are all over it they like

1621
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:36,289
this is just propaganda it's like it's

1622
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:38,510
real sure that more kids get to go to

1623
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:40,759
college it's a propaganda when that kid

1624
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:42,680
goes to college how was that propaganda

1625
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,330
like some real [ __ ] one of the things

1626
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,399
people won't refuse to accept is that

1627
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:48,259
marijuana was always here in a way

1628
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,630
that's so much larger than any

1629
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:55,160
one really wants to admit I mean it's 60

1630
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:59,090
billion coast-to-coast six zero billion

1631
01:01:55,159 --> 01:02:01,009
I mean that's a huge amount of money I

1632
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:04,160
don't think anybody can fathom that much

1633
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:05,930
cash it's I mean yeah in 20 our bills

1634
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,500
it's a couple of high schools full

1635
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:11,389
probably I don't know but it's an insane

1636
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:14,239
amount of big pools just and off

1637
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:16,549
hundreds it's all just under the surface

1638
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,259
it's your neighbor's house it's the park

1639
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:20,480
your kids play at it's the school your

1640
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:22,520
kids go to it's even the [ __ ] prisons

1641
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,650
like prohibition doesn't work at all

1642
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:26,360
it's right under our noses it's always

1643
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:29,990
has been it always will be

1644
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,730
it's just mostly invisible the only

1645
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:33,429
people who are able to be visible with

1646
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:37,340
it are the people with nothing to lose

1647
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:38,899
and no one's willing to admit that in

1648
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,950
Colorado anymore everybody's like it's

1649
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:44,840
new especially the anti-pop people and

1650
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:46,639
all we did was shift where people buy it

1651
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,300
and we're able to do so many cool things

1652
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,750
with that money

1653
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:53,210
yeah industry now we can make Terps cuz

1654
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,710
now we got science to be afraid to go if

1655
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,690
you get caught buying the equipment that

1656
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,980
it takes to make these Terps at the

1657
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,869
store they turn you in for making a

1658
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,769
[ __ ] meth lab back in the day and I

1659
01:02:59,869 --> 01:03:01,969
can be like no we're with this

1660
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:04,429
dispensary and we need all this

1661
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:07,309
equipment to make hash and now you can

1662
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:09,589
do that we can more effectively treat

1663
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:11,840
patients everyone forgets about the

1664
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:14,090
patients we're all about getting Turkish

1665
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,059
penned the first 20 minutes with a new

1666
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:20,590
big fat bag of weed looking for mole

1667
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:25,099
looking for mildew looking for washers

1668
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:27,559
spine rigs all kinds of nasty funks yeah

1669
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:30,139
I've got toenails and Syd they're

1670
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:32,690
breaking up bud and have a bug crawl out

1671
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:36,529
of the noggin up your arm like it was me

1672
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:38,200
that [ __ ] we used to put up with and the

1673
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:41,210
fact that it's all gone now

1674
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:44,539
like there did this the benefits stream

1675
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:46,309
just it's endless it's so far past the

1676
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:48,800
money but for a place like Pueblo the

1677
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:50,630
money's vital does south of town even

1678
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,060
smaller the sheriff was in the paper

1679
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,559
like it wasn't sure what to think at

1680
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:56,809
first now I love it look what it's done

1681
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,549
to the downtown area yeah yeah they

1682
01:03:56,809 --> 01:04:00,139
built a Riverwalk down there because of

1683
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:01,940
cannabis money yep there

1684
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:05,150
Trinidad's not gonna die now you

1685
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,800
it was we had steel here yep and steel

1686
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,970
isn't as big as it used to be people

1687
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,349
want to go lightweight now so it's

1688
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:12,259
titanium and we don't have a titanium

1689
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:14,480
mill we have a steel mill and so people

1690
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,890
were leaving and people don't want to

1691
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,599
work at a steel mill forever now it's

1692
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:18,559
kind of the technology era people are

1693
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,269
getting the [ __ ] out of here

1694
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,969
Stan was going bad I've lived here for a

1695
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:24,588
long time Mike and I have been here we

1696
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:26,328
were here before all the cannabis [ __ ]

1697
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:28,250
happened him and I have seen this town

1698
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:30,769
it was kind of a little little cow town

1699
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,389
when I moved here it was flourishing

1700
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:35,210
like it's actually going somewhere now

1701
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:36,828
I'm kind of proud we're finally crawling

1702
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,240
out of the funk we were in for like 40

1703
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:43,640
years

1704
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:45,169
Wow the flood [ __ ] us up I mean

1705
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:49,239
honestly it was when the steel mill

1706
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:51,380
started to slow down a whole huge

1707
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,088
generation of people didn't have an easy

1708
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:56,269
way to feed their families down here it

1709
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:57,828
wasn't easy to find work anymore um you

1710
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:59,869
really had to work at it when I moved

1711
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:03,019
here you had to know somebody that was

1712
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:04,490
hiring yeah period that's how this town

1713
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:06,170
is this is one of those towns where you

1714
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,578
can fill out a thousand applications and

1715
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:08,240
unless you know somebody here you're not

1716
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:11,030
gonna get a job

1717
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,879
most of the the job and housing listings

1718
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:15,410
never make it online here it's you drive

1719
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,240
up and down the streets you want to live

1720
01:05:15,409 --> 01:05:19,159
on and look for someone putting out a

1721
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:20,629
for rent sign and walk up and talk to

1722
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:23,029
that person before it's it's out there

1723
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:24,890
too long it's the same thing with jobs

1724
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:26,720
you heard a friend of yours got fired

1725
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:29,358
wandering to wherever they used to work

1726
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,739
and talk to the manager stat um cuz

1727
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,710
otherwise there ain't no job for you in

1728
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:35,929
the city and that's slowly changing now

1729
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:37,909
we have hiring a terse staffing agencies

1730
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:40,909
now that that help people get a foothold

1731
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:43,039
in the marijuana industry we have an

1732
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:45,409
industry down here that's gonna need a

1733
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:49,730
hundred more trimmers next year shadow

1734
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:51,529
to lioness did the real downside is that

1735
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:53,440
we're not publicizing in all 50 states

1736
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:56,150
what it takes to work in this industry

1737
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,210
but people think that they can show up

1738
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:01,068
late and take a [ __ ] be 20 minutes late

1739
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:03,050
and hang out I talked to people every

1740
01:06:01,068 --> 01:06:04,940
day that are shocked to learn it's like

1741
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,349
a real business yeah they think you

1742
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,480
could just hang out smoke joints all day

1743
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:10,630
and [ __ ] off and like they thought their

1744
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,039
high school weed dealer had a store now

1745
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,900
where he just kind of like hung out and

1746
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,679
played xbox and this totally would lead

1747
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,269
at his table

1748
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,279
and then you gave him money and it was

1749
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,719
weird and then they'd leave and they

1750
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,750
walk in and they see what looks

1751
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:25,909
basically like an apple store or a purse

1752
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,469
or shoe store in the mall if you just

1753
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:28,609
gave me a chance to tease something that

1754
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:30,079
we're gonna talk about on a future

1755
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:31,940
episode I want to wait until you and

1756
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,829
Lyndsey are here we're gonna talk about

1757
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,440

1777
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:18,260
way back in the wild [ __ ] West days

1778
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,450

1779
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:22,580

1780
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:27,289
my face cuz we ran the place before you

1781
01:07:22,579 --> 01:07:28,940
like you could get a weave really my leg

1782
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:30,110
hurts I need weed card and they'd say

1783
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,220
how much money you got and he'd tell

1784
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,690
them they'd write you that many plants

1785
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:34,849
like here you go have a great [ __ ]

1786
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:37,309
day they didn't even care back then like

1787
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:39,650
weed card for sale well that was the in

1788
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:41,509
the very first days like even the

1789
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:44,360
doctors were at the the fringe of

1790
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:46,190
society because the DEA was still

1791
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,829
threatening that if a doctor wrote a

1792
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:50,840
recommendation for marijuana in Colorado

1793
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:52,849
that they could lose their DEA license

1794
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:57,380
to write prescriptions for anything any

1795
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:59,509
other drug and so the doctors that were

1796
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:02,329
like the first five doctors in Colorado

1797
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:04,070
to sign paperwork period were the kind

1798
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:05,779
of doctors where like if you were there

1799
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:07,640
because you fell on something and it

1800
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,070
went through like your forearm or your

1801
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:11,809
leg you start talking to him and after

1802
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:12,430
15 or some minutes or so you'd be like

1803
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:16,100
you know what

1804
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:18,920
don't doc I'm just gonna the next doc up

1805
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,329
the road sorry look I don't care that

1806
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,480
I've been paid for something that's not

1807
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:25,340
gonna kill me immediately yeah but that

1808
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,849
changed six months later when they

1809
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:29,029
stopped counting doctors

1810
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:32,280
that weird ass dock that used to come to

1811
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:33,750
ponytail yeah with the ponytail no that

1812
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,489
was the husband a husband had a ponytail

1813
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,779
in a cane the doctor was the woman who

1814
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:38,309
wouldn't look you in the eye

1815
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,170
oh no I'm talking about the crazy guy in

1816
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:42,180
the crazy wife they used to come

1817
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,800
together yeah okay is that okay yeah

1818
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:45,480
well see I was working in a dispensary

1819
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,980
the lady that owned that dispense were

1820
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:48,779
used to bake edibles and she would show

1821
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,399
up with trays of edibles and she'd be

1822
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:52,710
like Mike and Jeff you have to drag some

1823
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,019
of those days around this carrot cake

1824
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:56,789
this [ __ ] banana bread there's the

1825
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,100
nine products I make here's your nine

1826
01:08:56,789 --> 01:09:01,500
samples and then you restock the shelves

1827
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,320
with the rest the five minutes later

1828
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:08,520
should go which one did you eat it's

1829
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,170
11:00 a.m. on us at work and she would

1830
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,700
go which one are you gonna eat right now

1831
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:13,949
in front of me yeah she didn't give a

1832
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:15,689
[ __ ] she'd stare at you and then look at

1833
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:17,130
the pile of options you had really

1834
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:19,469
curious as to what you might fake

1835
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:21,650
totally oblivious that you took this a

1836
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:23,970
little more seriously than she did or

1837
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:25,559
you're not interested in finding out how

1838
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:28,680
strong she made him this week at 11:00

1839
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,000
a.m. and 15 minutes after you ate the

1840
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,280
first one she'd ask you what the next

1841
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,390
one's gonna be yeah and there are some

1842
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:35,550
days where I don't know how we made it

1843
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:37,400
through clothes there were some times

1844
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,480
when the numbers were a little bit off

1845
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:41,549
there were some days I wasn't sure

1846
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,750
people were keeping numbers yeah so I'm

1847
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,949
pretty sure there were some eight gram

1848
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,199
quarters going out the door sometimes

1849
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:48,539
like there was a window that we had to

1850
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:50,489
stay within between and we just kind of

1851
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,019
kept it from going too far outside of

1852
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:56,489
that little box shout out to Karen and

1853
01:09:52,020 --> 01:10:04,680
her homemade edibles Josh and I fell

1854
01:09:56,489 --> 01:10:05,460
down the stairs like laughing like

1855
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,140
ladies

1856
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,970
I remember that walk you have three

1857
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,079
flights of stairs and ridiculous heat

1858
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:12,240
because it got really hot in that

1859
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:13,859
building and I'd get to the third floor

1860
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:17,130
knowing that that was where I needed to

1861
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:18,659
go and have no idea why was it and I get

1862
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,430
halfway back downstairs before I

1863
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:23,029
remembered whatever it was I went up for

1864
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:25,050
that place was fun speaking of edibles

1865
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:28,050
I'm pretty sure I mentioned eating a

1866
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:31,409
1000 milligram Josh excuse me for that a

1867
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,940
1000 bucks guys I don't recommend it

1868
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:34,289
don't eat a thousand milligram animal

1869
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:36,000
unless you want to be [ __ ] up for a

1870
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:38,250
day and a half if you're not me probably

1871
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,109
three days I think like a civilian if

1872
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,060
you gave that to like right

1873
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:51,960
well not the OD else that we know that

1874
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:54,210
doesn't the hundred milligram edible if

1875
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,859
people get novices gobble that sucker up

1876
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:58,739
six eight hours is what people report

1877
01:10:55,859 --> 01:11:00,630
it's just you ate the hundred milligram

1878
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:03,659
just talking about a 1000 yeah a

1879
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:04,980
thousand miserable honest I haven't been

1880
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,479
I've been gun-shy / I haven't eaten

1881
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:08,849
inedible since then I've been a little

1882
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,149
bit happens I did it to myself the other

1883
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,310
day

1884
01:11:09,149 --> 01:11:13,769
it wasn't even with a really big dose I

1885
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:15,300
just I popped a couple I thought I'd be

1886
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,240
comfortable with it we got to the movie

1887
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:19,890
theater I looked up and was just pluck

1888
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:21,809
there were so many food choices and

1889
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:23,520
before I could figure out what I wanted

1890
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:25,800
I heard my wife giggling next to me like

1891
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,480
she's not a smoker but she knows when I

1892
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,659
look up and I'm just too big to pick

1893
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:33,089
from the menu and I didn't mean to do it

1894
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:36,960
it was an accident um so what happens to

1895
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:39,810
the pros - but yeah thousand milligrams

1896
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,670
those were off on my system it [ __ ] me

1897
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,320
up my whole body felt weird for a day

1898
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:45,659
and a half people assume that that's

1899
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:47,639
like the comfortable intro to some

1900
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:50,250
marijuana consumption and it's not like

1901
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:52,320
smokings the the time-tested smoked some

1902
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,939
flowers through a pipe so explorers

1903
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,359
through a bong or a joint get used to

1904
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,579
that

1905
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:58,409
take a DAB one day they're like three

1906
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:00,600
dads in one day and then start taking

1907
01:11:58,409 --> 01:12:02,849
big dabs and then dab every day and then

1908
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,250
eat some edibles progressed slow because

1909
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:09,270
the expensive bit did well yeah

1910
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:11,550
Rick junkie I like a good rag I did as

1911
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:13,320
long as you can do you can you can look

1912
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:16,770
people in the eye and say I don't eject

1913
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:18,659
what I'm addicted to I just buy glass

1914
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:22,800
it's not the same different kind of

1915
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:25,439
