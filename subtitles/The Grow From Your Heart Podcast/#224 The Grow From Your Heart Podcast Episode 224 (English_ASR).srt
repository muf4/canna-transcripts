don't you hate that [ __ ] do people do

112
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,249
that to you it's silly because I still

113
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,830
consider myself an open mic er the avian

114
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:27,990
comedian is something I aspire to be but

115
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:31,848
I don't like it oh you're a comedian now

116
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:35,069
not really I'm not getting paid for this

117
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,538
I'll consider myself a comedian or like

118
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,460
consider the years I've been a comedian

119
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,598
as like as many times as I claim it on

120
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,158
my taxes and [ __ ] like that nice when

121
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,098
you actually start getting like booked

122
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:50,158
for gigs like that like we're just local

123
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:53,610
feature guys like a lot of and that's

124
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,658
what takes a lot of it is a lot of heart

125
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,399
and that's what you need a lot of guys

126
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,449
are they just don't have the heart they

127
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,800
want to go up there and repeat the same

128
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:05,098
[ __ ] every week and you can tell there's

129
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:08,158
doing it to just do it it's negative

130
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:10,288
[ __ ] I'm feeling about myself out and if

131
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,058
I can make people laugh from it then it

132
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:20,218
kind of validates all the shitty things

133
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:22,080
that I've ever done I'm not doing it for

134
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,788
anybody else the way the way Paul does

135
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,389
is comedy itself deprecatingly

136
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:29,098
yeah so like yeah it might sound like oh

137
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,769
this is he's doing it for himself and it

138
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,778
is but it's also like I need to tell you

139
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,459
this yeah that's a healthy way to get

140
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:41,908
[ __ ] out yes way cheaper than a

141
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:43,528
therapist and a lot of guys will you

142
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,328
know we're all we're always trying new

143
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:47,549
stuff there's only a few guys that you

144
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:51,409
know kind of have fallen into a trap of

145
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:55,469
not doing new stuff fairly regularly but

146
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:57,629
it's it's fun to see like when a joke

147
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,790
can fail too and you can see what he

148
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,889
wanted to do with it and it's like damn

149
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,028
- it's like if you - twisted this that

150
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,610
joke would have worked

151
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:07,740
it's neat seeing that stuff so you get

152
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,600
to see like the initial and like why

153
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,730
didn't that work and then you talk about

154
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,019
it and oh okay and you get to see it the

155
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,339
next time he does it and he's got a

156
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,190
little bit more confidence because he's

157
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,620
done it once like open mic comedy is so

158
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,839
fun to watch as an art form

159
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,448
not just the comedy that you're watching

160
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,840
but the comedy is like the reason you're

161
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,629
putting

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,230
but since seats yeah but for us to watch

163
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:36,029
guys evolve and get better in like

164
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:38,430
perfect case in point was Dan rainy he

165
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:42,509
was he was really not good when he

166
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:45,149
started and but he went from not good

167
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:47,789
and he was okay but he just now he's

168
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,329
good and it came fast it went a lot

169
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:53,490
easier for him to go from not good to

170
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,440
like good I think confidence had a lot

171
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,789
to do with that his material I thought

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,620
was always funny it's just when he told

173
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:00,929
it he was kind of unsure about it and

174
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,810
you can't really to get him started

175
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:05,819
didn't it just to get him on stage he's

176
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:07,679
been coming to comedy shows since like

177
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,830
six months I first started doing comedy

178
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,029
and he was just so scared to get up on

179
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,900
stage and tell a joke and then he

180
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,959
finally did it

181
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,579
and for some people once you do it that

182
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,240
just opens up the flips you can't stop

183
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,259
all admit as I was a teenager I've

184
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,820
watched a comedy you can tell from

185
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,200
talking to me and I've been into comedy

186
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,700
as long as you guys have enough but I've

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,530
been in that Club and I would love to

188
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,379
walk up on stage and throw down one good

189
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,179
set and I've got a podcast I'm obviously

190
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,649
okay was talking in a group we do grow

191
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,629
meetings where I just run my mouth and

192
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,159
talk about growing dude I get I just

193
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,629
thinking about going up there to do a

194
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:47,399
set no thank you

195
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:49,080
I want to [ __ ] my pants but I know that

196
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,549
that's not my wheelhouse yeah

197
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,870
it's just weird for me to even think

198
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,609
about getting up there but at the party

199
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,980
or whatever I'll tell everybody a joke

200
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,050
all day long that's the other when you

201
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,430
get up there and you really feel like

202
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,659
you have something to say and you want

203
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:02,099
to tell these people something and they

204
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:06,480
don't laugh at all it's so heartbreaking

205
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,430
yeah yeah but that's that's the thing

206
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,620
that I like watching and other guys and

207
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,419
and myself is you watched these guys

208
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,830
like I was trying to go to with Dan it's

209
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,959
like he evolved and you could see that

210
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,900
evolution every step and it was neat and

211
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,460
I think that um you know there's guys

212
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,199
that don't want to come out to shows all

213
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,600
they tell the same jokes or something

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,370
like that but it's like no like look at

215
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,720
the new thing that he did to the end I

216
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,429
don't know like I know that we're

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
probably getting pretty deep on like oh

218
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,919
no it's like writing it's looking

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,810
tailoring that

220
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,309
joke it's why I understand what you're

221
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:36,809
saying it does it's not something it's

222
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:38,159
like making a recipe perfect the first

223
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,569
time you make that recipe it was too

224
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,189
spicy but you knew what you're aiming

225
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,820
for you took out a little spice added

226
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,709
more garlic

227
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,990
it's like watching and I've seen you do

228
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,819
it I've watched your joke-telling evolve

229
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,289
not just your jokes get better but your

230
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,459
approach to telling a joke you don't

231
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,110
have to get naked to have a punchline

232
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,879
anymore because your jokes have some

233
00:11:52,110 --> 00:12:12,600
body to keep your clothes on that was a

234
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:17,309
long time ago I've ever seen I'm looking

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,379
for Dan rabies Twitter feed there you go

236
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:24,958
look for a champion just follow him

237
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:26,129
randomly there's a few funny funny

238
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,859
people come out of the springs but I

239
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,480
think he's one of the funnier ones he's

240
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,480
really working at it and it's neat to

241
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,670
see that so it's it's definitely it's

242
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,079
like having a second job when you're not

243
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:40,439
getting paid for it you're not getting

244
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,389
paid for it yeah I'm a musician and I've

245
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,829
gotten played free shows and just that I

246
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,389
know that feeling it is locking in with

247
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:47,639
the bass player and getting a song right

248
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,708
but that was worth my set-up time my

249
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,828
taps couple hours on stage yeah oh for

250
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:55,409
sure to drive to wherever and go do 15

251
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:57,870

252
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:00,120

253
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,360

254
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,970

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,459

257
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:19,698
all of my material exploding your Jail

258
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:21,899
experience for a material I have okay

259
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:25,609
material in a recent break and should

260
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,610
write a joke about rape

261
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,370
my comedy is very personal like I have

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,078
to be 100% honest with my writing in my

263
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,539
comedy because I feel like that's the

264
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,099
only way that I can really find my own

265
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,169
voice because I'm still looking for it

266
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't really know what I'm exactly

267
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:44,539
doing and I just write from I'm still

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,039
confused if you did

269
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,039

who was in there who was apparently

272
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,909
someone's [ __ ] and that made me feel

273
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,649
because we were gonna talk about weed in

274
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,689

307
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,990
15 days and that was almost 10 years ago

308
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,209

311
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:42,740
more jail I don't do anything that would

312
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,058
even like make me worth being in trouble

313
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,938
it was the only thing I ever did was

314
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:53,749
smoke too much weed just about all day

315
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:54,948

Colorado is getting full and it's

317
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:58,969
getting expensive to rent a house here

318
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:01,938
make cannabis legal where you are you

319
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,230
can do that there too yes you can I mean

320
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,399
it's cool if you're hot and you wear

321
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:11,389
yoga pants come here

322
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:22,129

top of you definitely come get on top of

324
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,459
you if you're really scared you can get

325
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:30,698
on top of me and it's like it's like you

326
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,698
know a fun air mattress with a penis

327
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,469
[Music]

328
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,509
because Clint actually told me that he

329
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,309
had a question for me and I'm going to

330
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:45,620
my text message to try to remember what

331
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:47,299
that question was yes yes and also about

332
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,610
using cannabis as a sacrament we talked

333
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,649
a little bit about Jamaica legalizing

334
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,909
cannabis for medical use on a past

335
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,179
episode it was either the last one or

336
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:57,948
the one before and they also have made

337
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,388
it it used to be if you recall with any

338
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:02,328
cannabis in Jamaica it would be a seven

339
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:04,609
day sentence in a Jamaican Jail and it's

340
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:08,599
nothing like the little luxury condo

341
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,769
that you just spent some time in no but

342
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,458
I've heard some good stories

343
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:15,619
it's the everyone in there trade stories

344
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,000
of like where to get arrested so you got

345
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,000
to go to Crowley County they have carpet

346
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,828
is the worst facility in the state

347
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,630
Wow I would believe that yeah well then

348
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:29,869
the Jamaican jail is it's still gonna be

349
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,250
worse yeah of course but so and now in

350
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:32,689
Jamaica if you get caught with cannabis

351
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,250
it's just a fine you don't go to jail

352
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,140
right away it's like a $200 fine if you

353
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,759
have less than an ounce so now guys like

354
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,560
us can go and also they've made it to

355
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,930
where if you have a medical marijuana

356
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,419
card in the states you can go there and

357
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:47,509
register your medical marijuana card for

358
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,340
a small fee and get a pass to buy

359
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:51,109
medical marijuana while you were in

360
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,000
Jamaica as other stores yeah I heard

361
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:55,039
their weight sucks though it's not going

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,049
to now because a lot of people from the

363
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,639
United States saw this coming the

364
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,899
cannabis was gonna be legalized and I

365
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,070
have friends in the industry that have

366
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,920
already flown down there and set up

367
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:05,210
shops and testing labs and BC bubbleman

368
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,210
was down there teaching everybody how to

369
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,450
make good hash so it's going on down

370
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,500
there yeah so that's kind of kind of

371
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,000
what I can tell you about Jamaica

372
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,799
without talking too much about what we

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,460
said on another episode but then you

374
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,279
asked me

375
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,650
ironically you said how about using

376
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,809
cannabis as a sacrament and then today I

377
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,120
look at the cannabis and there's the

378
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,190
news page I check out the cannabis there

379
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,349
headline is new in Indiana a cannabis

380
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,910
Church gets its chance yeah I think

381
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:35,269
that's where I got that idea for that

382
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,940
question Wow nice was because Indiana

383
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:42,619
passed that law that allows people to

384
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:45,380
discriminate against gays like now like

385
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:47,179
as a part of religion is it okay to

386
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,770
smoke weed there right and it has to be

387
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,289
because they can't tell you what to do

388
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:52,490
yeah I that law yeah if you're gonna

389
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,960
hold one you gotta uphold you know I'll

390
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,430

395
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,900
life we're all called can--it Aryans I

396
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:16,819
don't know how I feel about the word

397
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:19,070
canotary box the article the lot of Jews

398
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:21,679
smoke pot they smoke weed

399
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:23,929
and a lot of them especially now with

400
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,190
like the younger like more alternative

401
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,600
Hasidic groups that are coming up like

402
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,910
in New York like the non ox and

403
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,119
everything like that

404
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,250
they they use it as a sort of way to go

405
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,339
back to their cultural roots the holy

406
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:40,359
anointing oil had cannibalism in it

407
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:41,889
which is cannabis and it had so much in

408
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,899
it that it would have psychoactive

409
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,150
effects in it in other cases they think

410
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,950
that when the high priest would go into

411
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,870
a tent to speak to God they would use

412
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,690
things like cannabis um different other

413
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:58,989
herbs and stuff and incense in olive oil

414
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,759
and the THC oil and everything and they

415
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:09,160
would just basically hotbox themselves

416
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:11,349
as a way to speak to God cannabis casita

417
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,640
if anyone's interested they should

418
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:15,369
definitely trouble check that one out

419

420
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:19,949
lot of religions used cannabis I think

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,140
not just the Rastafarians used cannabis

422
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,130

out a blowtorch and you start heating

488
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,179
that [ __ ] up I'm sure it does it looks

489
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,519
like drugs

490
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,750
yeah guys we're just just remember that

491
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,490
the tree isn't a torsion it looks like

492
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,230
we're heating up some crack it seriously

493
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,819
does so like if people are discriminated

494
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:26,630
against you for doing dabs I am too

495
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:30,730
because it looks like drugs it's

496
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,730
supposedly cleaner right than smoking

497
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,140
you're smoking you're smoking the more

498
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,569
like pure form of it it just [ __ ] me up

499
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,040
so much like a different method now yeah

500
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:41,480
there's no beauty yeah the message

501
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,579
you're probably talking about is rosin

502
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,250
tech where we're just using a pressing

503
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,720
comb like a straightening iron

504
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,180
squeezing the juice out of the blood by

505
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,589
that way but with the pho the butane

506
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,210
there's no butane left in our product

507
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:53,349
we're uh we're getting it clean we

508
00:23:52,210 --> 00:24:03,850
figured out how to clean it out real

509
00:23:53,349 --> 00:24:04,929
well that's good you are cigarettes I

510
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:08,439
don't know if you guys ever smoked those

511
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,570
before but give them a try on a previous

512
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,279
episode there are three guys in the room

513
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:13,149
I took like a half gram dab and didn't

514
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,889
choke in the other two guys are

515
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,480
cigarette smokers and they took little

516
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,950
tiny dabs and had to get up and leave so

517
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,970
they could go hock loogies and die for a

518
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:51,130

think this is the like the least amount

524
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:04,210
I've weighed in my whole life so I feel

525
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,690
like Paul has a few things he needs to

526
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,690

Paul's part is from Mexico 11 who spoke

547
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,910
to the post by phone so the church has

548
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,920
received two thousand dollars in

549
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,779
donations that received more than $7,000

or seven thousand Facebook fans in the

551
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:20,589
five days that it has existed he hopes

552
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,750
to build the first church or temple

553
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:24,069
built of hempcrete a building materials

554

similar to concrete well that includes

00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:33,549
him I think it's amazing you need to

556
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:35,019
start using this more industrial now

557
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:37,000
grow hemp in the United States they

558
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:39,220
doing just taking rocks out and creating

559
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,690
putting the hemp in instead of concrete

560
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,789
you know I don't know how they make

561
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,500
concrete so I don't want to sound stupid

562
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:46,500

stop I just want to get through this one

567
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:34,609
article through the whole 45 minutes

568
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:37,129
show we're progressing to get a building

569

property to be our holy ground he said

570
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,980
we're going to set up counseling for

571
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,019
heroin service and we have a huge

572
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,910
epidemic in this country we'll probably

573
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,549
have Alcoholics Anonymous - I'm not

574
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,920
going to allow alcohol on the premise

575

Levitt also wrote out the new DeeDee

576
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,480
doesn't in Commandments like a Ten

577
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,130
Commandments like lists with suggestions

578
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,269
for better living sorry I'm laughing at

579
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,560
this article and you guys will I'm

580
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,599
trying to read the

581
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,849
Bibles of other religious religions our

582
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,609
yesteryear about the drinking out of

583
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:06,049
goat skins what about drinking out of

584
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:08,329
goat skins that doesn't relate to the

585
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:10,519
people with GPS in their hand and 7,000

586
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,319
Tunes in that same hand he said the

587
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,940
church is very simple the first good

588
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,559
book we're going to ask petitioners to

589
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,110
read and understand is the Emperor wears

590
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,879
no clothes so it kind of feels to me

591
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,479
like this guy's copying that church on

592
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:44,540
weeds

593
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:47,660
remember that church on weeds really

594
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:49,549
good article he says I'm very spiritual

595
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,960
and I'm filled with love he said I find

596
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,460
that most religions are misled into

597
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,259
gross perversions of what they're meant

598
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,819
to be this math has led me to lead a

599
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:57,440
religion that people in today's world

600
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:59,509
can relate to we don't have any guilt

601
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,759
doctrine built-in we don't have any sins

602
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:03,230
built-in once the church's ascent is

603
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,150
established members will be asked for

604
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,279
individual donations of four dollars and

605
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,200
20 cents a month he said Indiana

606
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,849
attorney and political commentator Abdul

607
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,039
Hakim Shabazz wrote the Indiana

608
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:14,299
legislators may have put the state in a

609
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,009
position to acknowledge those who

610
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,500
profess to smoke pot as a religious

611
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,569
sacrament you see if I would argue that

612
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,829
under RFA as long as you can show that

613
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:23,659
reefer is part of your religious

614
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,970
practices you got a pretty good shot of

615
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,820
getting off scot-free he wrote remember

616
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,680
under RFRA the state has to articulate a

617
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:34,220
compelling interest in preventing you

618
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,960
from smoking pot I argue they can't the

619
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,690
Church of cannabis is just one test in

620
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,880
many under any Indiana's new law which

621
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,650
has escalated a national prominence in

622
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,780
the past week raising questions about

623
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,150
the future of religious freedom laws and

624
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:49,279
gay rights so I should recap a little

625
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,950
bit but the reason that this is popping

626
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:55,129
up is because in Indiana they just tried

627
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,309
to do some rude [ __ ] to gay people

628
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,480
citing the Bible as their reasoning and

629
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:01,220
then these people said well if you're

630
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,890
gonna cite the Bible for saying the

631
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,569
Bible says

632
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,640
I don't even want to get into the Bible

633
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:08,980
some folks interpretation of the Bible

634
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,390
says that homosexuality is wrong I'm not

635
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,680
gonna say if I agree or disagree I'm

636
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,540
gonna say that that's what that one book

637
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,789
says in what people have read so since

638
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:17,349
that is a thing we're also saying that

639
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:18,940
in that same book they've said that all

640
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,799
these herbs are here for us to smoke

641
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,029
we're playing by these rules on the gay

642
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,099
thing we're playing by these rules on

643
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:26,529
the pot saying haha we win what this

644
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:32,469
church is trying to do sick yes I think

645
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:36,720
that's kind of cool two cues I want to

646
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,730
see a Letterman top ten of his like his

647
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,360
do's and don'ts like number one thou

648
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:46,360
shalt not spill the bong water okay I

649
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:49,409
hate when people use the Old Testament

650
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,939
as their sort of you know guide to

651
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,560
hating on gays and hating on anything

652
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,640
because that's where all the anti-gay

653
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:59,139
stuff comes from it doesn't come from

654
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:03,970
the New Testament and the reason why a

655
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:06,040
lot of people think that they put the

656
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,690
anti in the Old Testament was you're

657
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:09,159
living in a desert you're living around

658
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,420
people who are all trying to kill you so

659
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,670
every baby counts at that point to

660
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:45,070
survive in the desert you're not

661
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:47,140
supposed to jerk off because the world's

662
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:51,730
grossly overpopulated so you can you can

663
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:55,509
have sex with a guy if you want you know

664
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,160
do it do you want to do that go for it

665
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:59,230
I'm not gonna stop you it's not my

666
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,540
business I've never tried but I'm open

667
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,259
if there's a handsome young guy who

668
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,500
wants to take me on a date a lot on the

669
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,569

676
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:25,338
[ __ ] sounds good live a little right

677
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:27,050
figured it out live a little if that's

678
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:29,779
something that I don't I guess I don't

679
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,000
feel like it's like weed sacramental to

680
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:35,929
me but it's just kind of like a hangout

681
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,818
thing to do yeah yeah I would much

682
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,338
rather go and hang out with somebody but

683
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:45,500
are you a religious or a spiritual

684
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:47,929
person otherwise no okay it's kind of a

685
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,699
way for people to just smoke pot and

686
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,369
kind of abuse it in that sense

687
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:56,328
absolutely I think there are a lot of

688
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:58,400
people I do it I do it my first dab is

689
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,869
medical that first dab makes my

690
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,730
shoulders not hurt did I knock myself

691
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:03,680
clean the [ __ ] out a few days ago like

692
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,889
clean out and I cook the first step

693
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:10,009
makes that not hurt second makes me good

694
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:12,019
and hi dad and having fun the fourth and

695
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,369
fifth stab that is just me abusing it

696
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,929
because I've got a lot of dads and I

697
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:17,599
like to see how high we can get today

698
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:19,098
yeah but in the morning what I'm here by

699
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,048
myself and I need some thinking to do

700
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,369
and I gotta clear my head and I got a

701
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:23,809
lot of [ __ ] on my mind and the world's

702
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,059
going too fast for me to get away from

703
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:27,500
it all turn off all the lights turn off

704
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:30,019
the TV turn off the phone turn off the

705
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,059
computer get a salient as I can roll up

706
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:35,179
a big fat spliff of just flowers just

707
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:36,890
bud buds that I grew my own personal

708
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:39,558
hidden away bud that nobody else has

709
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:41,480
access to nobody gets to see roll that

710
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,210
up smoke a big fatty middle finger sized

711
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,358
joint by myself and close my eyes and

712
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,920
just see what I am really thinking

713
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,750
because sometimes my head's just going

714
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,480
too fast to even really hear what I'm

715
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,010
thinking and when I get nice and blaze

716
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,240
and just close my eyes and just shut up

717
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:00,799
for a minute and get into that quiet

718
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,689
space that's that's the truth it's not I

719
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:04,338
didn't really I'm not mad about some

720
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,318
Facebook [ __ ] Facebook doesn't matter

721
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:08,029
once you close your eyes and go into

722
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:09,529
that bubble whatever she said on

723
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,298
Facebook doesn't matter that guy talking

724
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,460
[ __ ] about your Instagram picture you

725
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:15,980
don't really care you're missing your

726
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,900
favorite TV show oh well you realize

727
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,909
like what's inside and it just kind of

728
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,650
it shows me more what I really need to

729
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:23,059
pay attention to and it kind of calms me

730
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,260
down a little bit yeah I felt like I had

731
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:26,179
the opposite thing for me especially

732
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,310
since I haven't been smoking pot and

733
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:30,769
smoking anything or doing anything

734
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:32,570
really for the past like 40 days and 50

735
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:36,559
days however many days it's been

736
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:40,010
I was definitely abusing it I smoked too

737
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,440
much needlessly just smoked you're

738
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,630
saying and I'm gonna take a DAB right

739
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,730
wouldn't it wouldn't necessarily like

740
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,960
clear my mind or help me think straight

741
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,469
or anything it would kind of just make

742
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,150
me think in worst ways because I was

743
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:54,649
always second-guessing myself and I was

744
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,269
just overthinking things and then my

745
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,190
brain wouldn't shut off because of it

746
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:59,780
so now that I haven't been smoking I

747
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,110
felt like it's greatly improved like my

748
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,370
writing and just my overall sense of

749
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,260
being that was something I wanted to

750
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:08,589
touch on kind of change the vibe a

751
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,580
little bit I know Clint's kind of

752
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,530
lightweight bro you smoke weed like a

753
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:20,630
little girl yeah but you're a cheap date

754
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:22,250
so I love it he's a big man I smoked

755
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,260
weed knows tasty that's some pretty

756
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,869
tasty bubba kush it didn't taste bad it

757
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,620
didn't make my mouth burn as good weed

758
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,409
good

759
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,179
you already took one ripoff of a pipe so

760
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,879
when you write some comedy

761
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:36,379
do you like write it when you're

762
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,420
straight and then embellish it when you

763
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,860
get lit or how does smoking affect your

764
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,200
writing where does it come into play no

765
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,180
there's it's kind of like there's two

766
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,710
cleansed in that aspect because there's

767
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:49,399
stone Clint and then there's sober

768
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:54,260
Clint's and and never the two shall meet

769
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,960
but no they stone Clint can write some

770
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,240
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] some of the [ __ ] that

771
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,619
comes out that I find in my phone when I

772
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:06,919
sober up is what the [ __ ] like this is

773
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,809
so weird and then I see and I remember

774
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,340
what I was trying to do with it but

775
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:13,429
there's no way I would have ever written

776
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,610
that sober okay and and i you know i've

777
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:18,049
i write a lot and in this last month i

778
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,150
haven't written a whole lot i just been

779
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:24,140
taking some time away from calm and he

780
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:26,269
just just to clear my head trying to get

781
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:28,730
my medications straight you know cuz i'm

782
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:31,400
on a couple of like antidepressants cuz

783
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:34,240
old happy Clint wasn't super happy here

784
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,710
recently so

785
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,539
Rippey and then see you know one on one

786
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,550
who are you yeah I've been seeing a

787
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:41,590
therapist too and it's that's like my

788
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,869
favorite time of the week yeah like I go

789
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,460
talk with the dude for like an hour and

790
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:47,380
he's just like dude I got you back I

791
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,699
don't care what you say like and I don't

792
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,829
do anything that's terrible

793
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,779
but I don't do anything or I don't feel

794
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,029
like I'm doing good enough anyway what I

795
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,340
was getting at it's like oh I I feel

796
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,440
both ways I'll get real introspective

797
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,880
like you do Jeff and like what what is

798
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,280
the problem that I'm feeling and then

799
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,380
deal with it right in that moment but

800
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,170
I've also gotten the way that Paul gets

801
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,730
and where it's like all right why is

802
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,289
that making me feel this way it's

803
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,110
because of this it's because of this I

804
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:15,190
need to like quit doing everything that

805
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,200
I do wrong

806
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,940
and only work because I got a 13 year

807
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,319
old daughter and I'm afraid she's not

808
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,240
gonna get to college cuz she wants to be

809
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,970
a surgeon then I start dwelling on that

810
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,759
and that freaks me out yeah so but I get

811
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:30,129
like the super happy way to like you

812
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,900
know this joke that I wrote just and

813
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,460
maybe it's a little bit long but you go

814
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,050
and edit it when you're sober and it's

815
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,300
great and then you tell it when you're

816
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,910
so I only I don't like getting up in

817
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,810
front of people stoned because I feel

818
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:50,079
like that's my time to be on point

819
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:52,929
yeah a lot of Mike time high and now

820
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,779
that I'm not it's so much better for me

821
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:58,118
I FinCEN bro I love you but I'm gonna

822
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,940
say this out loud I feel Doug Benson

823
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,858
being so high really squishes his comedy

824
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,079
he could be a better performer if he

825
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,739
weren't so high yeah like I could see it

826
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:07,779
it slows him down

827
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,969
I've seen him forget I've I personally

828
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,760
have gotten Doug Benson so high before a

829
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:14,889
show that he's just flub complete bits

830
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,800
and looked at me and said Rasta Jeff you

831
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:20,500
got me way too high he told me on stage

832
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,530
that I got him too high yeah like that's

833
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,269
you'd never see a lot of other comedian

834
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,960
Bill Cosby doing that I'll tell you that

835
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:30,759
well

836
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,760
I like the silence that you just dropped

837
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,869
picking on Michael Jackson like it's

838
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:37,130
there people have chosen sides and if

839
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:38,420
you [ __ ] decide which side you're on

840
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:47,960
publicly then the other side hates you

841
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:50,409
that's gonna stay impartial sexually

842
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:56,380
abusing me gets me a TV spot I'm there

843
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:56,379
[Music]

844
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:07,460
I'm on there but don't come for me come

845
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:19,690
for Mary Mack and her husband yeah we'll

846
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:24,208
come for you to entertain Minh reasons

847
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,208
[Music]

848
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:38,419
and yeah it's it's both ways though like

849
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:40,298
I can be stoned right but my inspiration

850
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,519
just comes from like the weirdest [ __ ]

851
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:46,190
just and like watching an infomercial

852
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,019
and it's like what the [ __ ] why am I

853
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,818
thinking about like this different way

854
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:53,719
to watch YouTube all the sudden yeah

855
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:56,239
like that's kind of how I started out

856
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:58,759
with just like trying to write comedy

857
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,169
about funny situations or just like

858
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,940
little things that I think of and I

859
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,798
can't do that anymore now I have to it's

860
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,240
all written about my personal experience

861
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:06,679
isn't about like my personal feelings

862
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,209
and stuff keeps it better

863
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:09,858
I think we're telling like listen to any

864
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,599
artist that's written an album about

865
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:13,308
themselves it was real that first album

866
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,619
that most people come out with it's

867
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,809
their real-life experience that second

868
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,608
third album it's studio pressure and

869
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:21,500
they ran out of life experience they're

870
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:22,759
just being a musician or that before

871
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,230
they really took something from that

872
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,030
experience and they made another one but

873
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,798
a lot of times but I'm not trying to say

874
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,980
that matisyahu's first album live at

875
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:32,088
stuffy's load but you can tell they spin

876
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,230
his whole life riding that and then

877
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:34,969
after that he's like oh I have to make

878
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:38,088
another album [ __ ]

879
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,949
yeah well I feel that way about comedy

880
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:42,139
too like you'll see some guys that like

881
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:44,960
their first like their first comedy

882
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:46,460
special was like whoa that's cool and

883
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,190
and you knew that they had worked like

884
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,619
12 years to get that just that one 30

885
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:57,429
minutes 30 minutes even like they're

886
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:57,430
like the first time I saw Dane Cook was

887
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:06,079
we were in high school and middle school

888
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,789
he was the guy and and you can't take

889
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,410
that away from him for a minute and and

890
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:13,909
I know people say always stole jokes

891
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:15,588
from people but I don't know man

892
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:19,639
you know he's yeah he sold out Madison

893
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:21,828
Square Garden so he made comedy blow up

894
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:25,159
we're still right in his coattails

895
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:27,680
because of him is why like premium blend

896
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:30,920
had him huh yeah and I don't remember a

897
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:34,279
lot of sense other than like him but you

898
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,960
you'll see like he blew up and now we're

899
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,510
all riding that coattails and I don't

900
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,088
remember what my point was now so that's

901
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,160
fun no but like his first album that's

902
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:45,949

903
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:56,210
minutes it was like oh [ __ ] and now you

different way you're meditating and

976

stuff and they will not use the iPods I

1034
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:09,980
became a nerd in a video store that was

1035
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,230
like my favorite thing to do when my

1036
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,519
parents would not want to deal with me

1037
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,170
and they'll just take him to the video

1038
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:16,940
store so we can rent a movie in a game

1039
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,650
and that's where I became a nerd and

1040
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,200
like that's where I first saw my first

1041
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:24,680
war big box and really got intrigued by

1042
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:27,230
the cover art but really why when I go

1043
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:29,149
out and I search through tons and tons

1044
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:31,039
of tapes at thrift stores I see

1045
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,690
something that I've never seen before

1046
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,400
but the cover arts really good but the

1047
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:37,070
movies [ __ ] terrible I love it

1048
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,840
because the cover arts so good and I

1049
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,330
just love shitty movies what's the

1050
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,610
shittiest what's the best shitty movie

1051
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:45,949

1052
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,950

1053
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:51,829
future that is the the shittiest [ __ ]

1054
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:54,859
movie I have ever seen it starts out

1055
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:56,869
kind of like a fantasy epic where

1056
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,849
they're fighting dinosaurs and

1057
00:52:56,869 --> 00:52:59,650
barbarians and there's a point when he

1058
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,900
uses

1059
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,579
he's as a pterodactyl as a hang-glider

1060
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,130
to kick someone in the face how did you

1061
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:07,389
do and then it just segues into no he's

1062
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,500
the hunter from the future sure I should

1063

fortunately for her they did find out

1293
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:51,010

1295
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,260

adventure cool ass dude I'm glad I met

1317
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:40,730
you they were how long have you been in

1318
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:43,048
this breeding game six years but I mean

1319
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:48,690
they're breeding forever you know I mean

1320
01:04:43,048 --> 01:04:50,909
who plants okay so that's a good

1321
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:54,619
question how long into your growing

1322
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:54,618
career did it take you to get breeding

1323
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:00,150
let's say for the first like I don't

1324
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,530
know four or five years you know is just

1325
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:05,460
straight growing you first get started

1326
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:10,920
no outdoor whatever but uh I'd say like

1327
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:12,480
six seven years four to six years seems

1328
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,068
to be for most of the major breeders and

1329
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:20,280
I've talked it like when I grew those

1330
01:05:14,068 --> 01:05:21,659
plants the first couple years we were in

1331
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,700
the underground you know you couldn't

1332
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:25,170
just back in the you know early 90s and

1333
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,358
stuff didn't be in places like Florida

1334
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:29,519
which is one of the worst states growing

1335
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:33,960
in Virginia that East Coast is really

1336
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:35,909
really that's about it you know and in

1337
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,559
in you couldn't really order seeds you

1338
01:05:35,909 --> 01:05:38,909
know and get certain streams and

1339
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,319
whenever you got good genetics and

1340
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:42,088
you've got good males you you may do

1341
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:43,858
with what you had and then you used a

1342
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:45,150
lot of older genetics I personally used

1343
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:47,190
a lot of older genetics when we were

1344
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:49,740
younger from parents passed down games

1345
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:51,269
of bill green old Afghans a lot of older

1346
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:53,459
Afghani and stuff a lot of the old piney

1347
01:05:51,269 --> 01:05:54,838
you know good piney buds that came out

1348
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,000
of Florida back in the day in the 80s

1349
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:59,239
and Florida's known for a lot of great

1350
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,239
things

1351
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,019
last few years they've really been being

1352
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:07,340
known for it and noticed absolutely

1353
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:09,530
there's actually been statistics to show

1354
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,090
that there's more growers indoors that

1355
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:13,040
get busted every year in Florida and

1356
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:17,000
there are registered cannabis users in

1357
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:19,099
California Wow Wow so we see this all

1358

01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,270
difference in your parents the better

1404
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,579
the outcome in your cross right if

1405
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,960
you've got completely different parents

1406
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:18,229
the better your crosses are gonna be in

1407
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,659
my opinion natural selection yes yeah so

1408
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:21,739
bro over here mr. sour seeds what are

1409

1410
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:25,519
top three top three I probably see one

1411
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,409
of my number one strange still to this

1412
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,920
day is probably the original Kim dog D

1413
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:32,180
or Kim for okay to this day it's not the

1414
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,800
frosty strain in the world but it has

1415
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,450
some of the greatest flavors you know

1416
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,829
all around it's just got the bang it's

1417
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:42,470
got the flavor it's got the punch it's

1418
01:09:36,829 --> 01:09:46,250
got the yield bag appeal the original

1419
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:48,650
G's you know see right now to it stills

1420
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:50,270
one of our families uh original strains

1421
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:52,339
from way back we've held this cut for

1422
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,780
probably close to eight to ten years now

1423
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,610
it's one of our original blueberries

1424
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:57,559
it's the old original blueberry yum yum

1425
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:59,210
used to hear about from Ludacris and

1426
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,980
back in the day and things like that

1427
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:03,439
it's not DJ's blueberry it's a berry

1428
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:04,849
indica dominant blueberry almost smells

1429
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,169
like ripe oranges halfway through

1430
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:08,030
flowering and then it really takes on a

1431
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:11,390
really sweet blueberry appeal during

1432
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:13,969
finishing ripening um very very potent

1433
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:15,800
very frosty very couch lock okay you

1434
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:17,899
know quick eight nine weeks or you know

1435
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,840
it's a very indica plant it's not gonna

1436
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:22,819
take you ten weeks to flower out and

1437
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,650
another one we've run is a probably a

1438
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:26,840
big one that we're having a big release

1439
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:28,729
on now is uh the space dragon which is a

1440
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,440
true West Himalayan cush landrace

1441
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:34,579
crossed with the original Kim ninety-one

1442
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:36,019
backcross male so this was a cross that

1443
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:38,449
was done probably seven eight years ago

1444
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,530
in Florida okay right now it's one of

1445
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:42,380
the hottest things in Atlanta Georgia

1446
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:44,750
has been ice for years down there in ran

1447
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,699
Tallahassee Florida an FSU college or I

1448
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:49,130

1449
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:50,719
stuff out on streets and people can't

1450
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:52,640
get enough of it we've gotten reviews

1451
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,659
from everywhere from you know the little

1452
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,640
guy to people they fight for the UFC um

1453
01:10:55,659 --> 01:11:00,380
we've we've actually sold pot there's

1454
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,560
people like Bastion Sebastian Janikowski

1455
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:06,380
and uh you know big football players and

1456
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,789
I mean it's it's the guys they just

1457
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,800
can't they can't get enough of the space

1458
01:11:07,789 --> 01:11:11,510
dragon man it is just it's it's strong

1459
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,279
it's devastating it lays you out and

1460
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,510
then you really can't think on it you

1461
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,309
know it's one of those even for the

1462
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,840
heavy smoker if you're looking for

1463
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:19,250
something like that they just you really

1464
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
want to get stoned you know I mean just

1465
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:24,229
really yeah I mean because you build a

1466
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:26,630
tolerance you look for thought-out

1467
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:28,609
strings that you you know you won't burn

1468
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:30,020
you out in you know seven eight years I

1469
01:11:28,609 --> 01:11:31,519
can still smoke the stuff and it still

1470
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:40,969
does the same effect to me that it did

1471
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:42,290
back in the day genetics you know taking

1472
01:11:40,969 --> 01:11:44,180
something from here in America and

1473
01:11:42,289 --> 01:11:46,189
taking with the best of the you know the

1474
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,210
you know and across the world you know

1475
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:48,409
and just trying to combine those

1476
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:51,079
genetics to give somebody something

1477
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:54,829
really really special I'm imagining kind

1478
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:57,199
of a real spicy real happy earthy spicy

1479
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:59,079
kind of a earthy and it has a spice to

1480
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:02,109
it but it's actually it all is

1481
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:03,880
really described since its it's been

1482
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:06,130
described as like really sweet but also

1483
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,640
has like a very overwhelming sense of Bo

1484
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:11,890
like body odor I love that kind of G's

1485
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:16,630
playing with has like a swampy funky

1486
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:19,180
foot but it's on the sweeter side this

1487
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:21,730
has the kind of citrusy twang kind of

1488
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:23,980
funk from the chem 91 in there you know

1489
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:25,329
it's it's really original what's really

1490
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:26,979
really unique and anybody that's ever

1491
01:12:25,329 --> 01:12:36,699
had it's really truly enjoyed it

1492
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:38,079
nice I look forward to my seed pack that

1493
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:39,340
was two strains you got the chem and

1494
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:40,689
then you got your space dragon what's

1495
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:55,029
stream number three that was the

1496
01:12:40,689 --> 01:13:00,129
blueberry serious concussion but I had a

1497
01:12:55,029 --> 01:13:01,779
minor brain bleed it's been I'm still a

1498
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,130
little goofy when I wake up and it takes

1499
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:19,809
me like an hour to get my [ __ ] together

1500
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:21,609
but I'm gonna be fine guys apparently I

1501
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:23,410
blew off two people I was supposed to

1502
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:36,939
meet somebody somewhere and I blew them

1503
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:39,489
off completely so those are three

1504
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:41,439
favorites which of those always coffin

1505
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:42,909
gotta give a second so are those since

1506
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,739
ones not released yet are those are the

1507
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:46,029
bestsellers or do you even release the

1508
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:47,679
you can't sell the blueberry yummy yeah

1509
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:50,380
because it's not yours to release right

1510
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,810
well it is mine to release so far I'm

1511
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,819
the only

1512
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:54,200
Colorado that has that cut my brother

1513
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:55,789
here from Florida we actually brought it

1514
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:58,670
in the computer case 2,000 miles over

1515
01:13:55,789 --> 01:14:00,560
here whoo you're mad man we take the

1516
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:02,359
risk we take the risk we appreciate it

1517
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,980
you know we tried to bring some dogs

1518
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:05,779
genetics this way we only bought you

1519
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:07,579
know a couple strings with us but it was

1520
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:09,109
our best you know and then that's what

1521
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:10,970
we brought with us a lot of the old

1522
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:14,139
strains are dead gone

1523
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:14,140
if Gainsbourg breeding is dead and gone

1524
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:20,659
big hand of that today to this day you

1525
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:23,329
know he still grows cannabis but he's

1526
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:25,220
completely blind why and he literally

1527
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:26,539
takes care of massive greenhouses and

1528
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:28,010
his plants look beautiful and amazing

1529
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:30,619
and he's been growing the same strange

1530
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:44,690
blueberry yum-yum beings bill green and

1531
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:46,279
things like that you know the old

1532
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,019
original Scott gave all these have been

1533
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:49,429
out cost I mean there's things that you

1534
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,040
can find in Florida that are very close

1535
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:54,230
but it's now crossing I grew up in SoCal

1536
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:55,850
there was a skunk screen there that I

1537
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:58,399
have never smelled since I've left that

1538
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:00,350
area I was in the Long Beach area was

1539
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,239
where my herb was coming from dude I've

1540
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:05,000
never smelled anything like it it's the

1541
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:06,859
closest I've gotten was I was at a Phil

1545
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:15,440
remember the old humble I walked over

1546
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,750
there and I was like how much for a

1547
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:18,710
quarter bro he's like 90 bucks I handed

1548
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,970
him a hundred-dollar bill and just

1549
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:26,149
walked away I was like have a great

1550
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:27,650
weekend I've gotten since I left

1551
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:34,129
California to the smell of just that

1552
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:36,259
Cali dank you come across that and it's

1553
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:38,300
very very 11 holidays you know it hasn't

1554
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:40,220
been put his hands on or it's it's

1555
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,560
really locked down on inner circles all

1556
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:44,960
right all right mr. Kent venture yes

1557
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,330
prefer to grow or breed sativas or

1558
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,829
indica [ __ ] that question up do you

1559
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:51,260
prefer to grow in trees indica or sativa

1560
01:15:48,829 --> 01:15:54,859
is what I was aiming for take more

1561
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:57,650
dabble you answer yeah man

1562
01:15:54,859 --> 01:16:00,210
preferably man I like I like to smoke

1563
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:03,210
like sativa hybrid you know what I mean

1564
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:05,220
so I mean I don't know I do I do free

1565
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:09,649
with some straight-up understand to get

1566
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:18,600
real diamond and down stuff but uh you

1567
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:20,639
know I I tend to catch myself breathing

1568
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,770
heavier toward the sativa side just

1569
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,740
because you like it I like this I think

1570
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:33,870
that 10 or 17 day extra longer flowering

1571
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:40,199
really does something just makes me too

1572
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:56,279
lazy so I take dabs of sativa to keep me

1573
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:59,099
moving something I find weird I like

1574
01:16:56,279 --> 01:17:01,639
growing smoking and breeding completely

1575
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:07,609
different strains for different reasons

1576
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:07,609
[Music]

1577
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,200
pushes a lot that's it's pretty much

1578
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:17,670
what I like I like stuff puts me to the

1579
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:19,079
couch I kind of need it nowadays I've

1580
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:21,810
been doing this a really long time and

1581
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:23,489
uh I've always had a lot of strong pot

1582
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,770
around yeah that's the thing with me I

1583
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:30,719
didn't really grow smokin swag I always

1584
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:37,170
had good home bro you're like 15 years

1585
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:39,720
old and you can out smoke something like

1586
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:41,369
that for me but like like you said when

1587
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,659
I'm working if I'm doing something like

1588
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,859
you know heavy labor or anything like

1589
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,539
that working on the gardens and things

1590
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:47,969
like that is the great that's that's

1591
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,470
when the blue dream comes out you know

1592
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:51,420
and yeah that's pretty much my main

1593
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:57,630
sativa that I will run as my Calicut

1594
01:17:51,420 --> 01:18:00,480
blue dream all right real tall super

1595
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:02,340
super fries with a grateful dog Pollan

1596
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,889
and she's been called blue heeler yeah

1597
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:06,779
yeah absolutely does that cut does a

1598
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,940
wonderful work with everybody is a true

1599
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:11,018
breeding cut I can't hardly get it to it

1600
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:13,628
is a hard to cut even get to reverse it

1601
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,859
yeah it is so stable you can stress it

1602
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:16,689
out kick it down the street it's gonna

1603
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:18,369
perform every single time no matter

1604
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:19,749
really what you hit it with I haven't

1605
01:18:18,368 --> 01:18:21,429
talked about this on the show this is

1606
01:18:19,748 --> 01:18:22,599
way off the topic that I had written but

1607
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:24,219
you guys will be two people to

1608
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:26,109
appreciate this actually should ask do

1609
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:29,948
you work with any feminized seeds bro I

1610
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:31,539
do okay okay I've been playing it for

1611
01:18:29,948 --> 01:18:35,348
I've been talking about it for probably

1612
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:36,938
three or four years I don't know I feel

1613
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:39,059
like it's selling out a little bit but

1614
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:41,849
in but look okay let me clear myself

1615
01:18:39,059 --> 01:18:49,569
it's taking me a while to get there but

1616
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:51,458
there is absolutely a purpose for the

1617
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:53,589
reason I did it was because I wanted to

1618
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:55,479
replicate a strain absolutely then I

1619
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:56,738
didn't have a good another cross for I

1620
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:59,390
was like I don't want to out breed I

1621
01:18:56,738 --> 01:19:02,478
want to duplicate that soy itself did

1622
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,479
[Music]

1623
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,748
okay totally totally there's definitely

1624
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:09,249
a reason for it's easy to do you know

1625
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:17,108
what I mean is not a whole lot going on

1626
01:19:09,248 --> 01:19:18,639
there just reverse you know you guys

1627
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:22,269
that's why you sold out of my seeds

1628
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:23,739
right now because I can't make it for

1629
01:19:22,269 --> 01:19:27,878
all the plants I just can't enough

1630
01:19:23,738 --> 01:19:28,928
Pawlenty had all these plants with I'll

1631
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:30,219
tell you why I was talking about

1632
01:19:28,929 --> 01:19:36,099
feminized seeds you're honestly gonna

1633
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:39,980
try to remember while I take this for

1634
01:19:36,099 --> 01:19:42,079
sure absolutely you know

1635
01:19:39,979 --> 01:19:43,939
you know like like Jeff saying you know

1636
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,579
it's a lot about the preservation the

1637
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:48,049
preservation of : only or you know save

1638
01:19:46,579 --> 01:19:49,609
even if it's your own hybrid and you've

1639
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,199
run through a hundred seeds and you find

1640
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:52,789
that one perfect female that super

1641
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:54,738
female you know that that they're right

1642
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:55,909
there that's perfect perfect example why

1643
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:57,919
you should feminized that strange

1644
01:19:55,909 --> 01:19:59,090
stabilize it right out the gate and

1645
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,710
that's what we've done with our space

1646
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:02,029
dragon as a matter of fact it's just a

1647
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,619
swan it'd give everybody the same

1648
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:05,988
version that we've come to Cronulla for

1649
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:08,090
seventy years you know and the only way

1650
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:14,389
to really do that truly is to not out

1651
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:16,429
cross it is to feminized yeah the

1652
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:18,110
diversity genetics Devine watch nature

1653
01:20:16,429 --> 01:20:19,760
take over the natural selection and just

1654
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:23,738
watch you know just just watch it take

1655
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,739
hold and really do what nature does

1656
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:30,260
nature does gauge green genetics is an

1657
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:32,269
f1 monster putting out the f1 to showing

1658
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,219
diversity if you guys know what that

1659
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:37,420
means give them a shout out for that too

1660
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:37,420
if you'll catch up

1661
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:44,869
I don't trust most F ones but gauges F

1662
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:47,149
ones are amazing something special going

1663
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:48,529
on keep playing that true I don't know

1664
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:51,409
what names they want me to use but shout

1665
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:56,948
out to keep playing green Mike yeah I'll

1666
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:56,948
call Mike and before ok ok four years

1667
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:04,159
amazing work I just do a lot of test

1668
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:05,480
work for gauge green I just got done

1669
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,859
running through some eight like seven

1670
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:09,379
eight year old beans of the original

1671
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:13,189
grape stomp a release we found the sour

1672
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:14,270
balls so we're so we're so excited about

1673
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:16,069
this one we're gonna be doing a lot of

1674
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,900
work with it soon gauge and the callee

1675
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:20,479
connection kind of put my brand on the

1676
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:21,979
map they sent me free gear to run for

1677
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:23,629
them and let me take pictures and then

1678
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:28,488
they publish my pictures and High Times

1679
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:30,109
and skunk-bag and [ __ ] like that to

1680
01:21:28,488 --> 01:21:31,459
everybody you know even the newcomers

1681
01:21:30,109 --> 01:21:33,019
into the game they'll even give you a

1682
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:36,948
chance you know and give you some seeds

1683
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:40,850
to get started up at the cup they swerve

1684
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:42,589
and the whole gauge crew most of my time

1685
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:46,070
at the Cali connection booth and the

1686
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:47,539
rest of my time at the gauge booth at

1687
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:49,698
the cup last year so I remember what I

1688
01:21:47,539 --> 01:21:51,769
was gonna say about reversing plants

1689
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:54,859
I took a strain

1690
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:56,450
is it I so I had a plan and I selfed it

1691
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:59,420
and made seeds out of that and I kept

1692
01:21:56,449 --> 01:22:01,309
the original mommy and then I took seeds

1693
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,319
and grew the seeds until I found one

1694
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:05,720
that looked just like mommy and then I

1695
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:07,819
reversed mommy again and put that pollen

1696
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,130
on this female and I can't get that

1697
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:11,569
offspring to reverse I found a beautiful

1698
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:14,989
female that is amazing she's been

1699
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:17,869
labeled GD 77 and she can't I can't not

1700
01:22:14,989 --> 01:22:20,239
reverse her with undiluted collodial

1701
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:25,000
silver silver silver' thiosulfate a

1702
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:25,000
hundred percent yeah and she just looked

1703
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:31,310
really true

1704
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:32,659
keep her there that's one of my breeders

1705
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:38,740
and I was hoping to be able to still

1706
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:40,399
reverse that so I had to go backwards I

1707
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:43,130
always told them one of the only

1708
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:46,099
breeders that's doing solid stress tests

1709
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:48,319
on my seeds when I before I will breed

1710
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,579
with the female I'll take like say I'm

1711
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,989
gonna breed with blue dream you know I

1712
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:53,869
would take blue dream and put her in a

1713
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:56,059
room by herself or whatever else I'm

1714
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:57,500
testing and run the light cycle for two

1715
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:59,660
weeks the way she should in flower and

1716
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,699
they disrupt it and like turn it to the

1717
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:06,229
opposite stress it out and see if I can

1718
01:23:01,699 --> 01:23:08,179
make her then I'll use those to breed if

1719
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:09,589
they if I really gotta kick their ass to

1720
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:19,039
make a perm then I'll use them if they

1721
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:20,539
hurt too easily this is fun I just like

1722
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:21,829
this random chatter maybe you guys will

1723
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:24,500
have an answer to this question I

1724
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:26,059
reversed a golden go plant and I took

1725
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,130
the pollen and I put it on four other

1726
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:30,380
plants and it made great stuff one of

1727
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:32,930
the plants the headband plant shriveled

1728
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:35,960
up and died when the pollen hit it like

1729
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:40,310
the the pistols went new and shriveled

1730
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,590
up and it died the lights went off the

1731
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:44,900
lights were going off i pollinated right

1732
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,440
before sunset or lights out hit the

1733
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:47,089
pollen

1734
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:48,289
I watched hung out for a minute you

1735
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,579
knows like the lights are going out I'm

1736
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:52,010
out of here I left the room I came back

1737
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:53,210
the next day to see what was dead bro

1738
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:56,570
other plants in the room were all

1739
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:59,779
everybody was happy I really expected

1740
01:23:56,569 --> 01:24:02,978
back playing over in the corner

1741
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:02,978
[Music]

1742
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:39,550
[Music]

1743
01:24:47,779 --> 01:25:23,849
the pollen is almost too much short tank

1744
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:24,869
out there nowadays and you know a lot of

1745
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:26,700
us that's been doing this a long time

1746
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:28,829
just a lot of us started out underground

1747
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:30,300
we really need to stick together keep

1748
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:32,130
the circles you know and help each other

1749
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:35,730
out and makes less of a short tank and

1750
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:48,659
more happy environment being a Colorado

1751
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:50,759
breeder lake because I got the East

1752
01:25:48,659 --> 01:25:51,899
Coast and they they run your tags and

1753
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,539
then that's all you need they need that

1754
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:58,949
number and they can get it yeah so guys

1755
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:01,019
look out for that Joanie's ghost

1756
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:04,769
listening yeah yeah be careful don't go

1757
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:06,420
to the hydro so just move where you are

1758
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:07,950
because the states that have legal

1759
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:09,359
cannabis are getting full and prices are

1760
01:26:07,949 --> 01:26:11,590
going up everybody's rents going up

1761
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:13,789
everywhere now in Colorado so

1762
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:15,409
where you are so that that way you don't

1763
01:26:13,789 --> 01:26:20,420
have to move here and pay 1200 bucks for

1764
01:26:15,409 --> 01:26:22,220
a small apartment all right so I'm gonna

1765
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:24,170
ask the Queen the crazy question now how

1766
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:35,390
do you guys feel about autoflowering

1767
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:36,859
seeds don't like grow them myself

1768
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:40,039
okay I have grown plenty of them I

1769
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:44,029
understand the breeding process them and

1770
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:47,779
breed them but I oughta flour needs to

1771
01:26:44,029 --> 01:26:50,179
be 80 90 days to 120 days from start to

1772
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:51,529
finish and not these 60-day 30-day

1773
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,270
whatever they're trying to push on the

1774
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:56,149
market right now there's no way for

1775
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:58,430
plant to get properly mature to give you

1776
01:26:56,149 --> 01:27:00,859
really anything worth a dime at the end

1777
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,390
of it or worth its weight in the effort

1778
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:03,829
that you put into that plant when you

1779
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:05,420
can do the same thing I have grown

1780
01:27:03,829 --> 01:27:07,130
regular seeds twelve and twelve from

1781
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,220
seed and got ounces off of them before

1782
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:11,989
and that's that's that's faster than 90

1783
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,130
days faster than what an auto flower can

1784
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:14,630
give it to you and you're gonna not

1785
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:18,319
you're not gonna suffer your potency

1786
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:20,840
yeah now for cash coffers and things

1787
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:23,210
like that that's that's probably where

1788
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,940
they're probably most appealing getting

1789
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,289
multiple crops or they do I feel they do

1790
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:28,789
have a little bit of a place and like

1791
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:31,010
still place like Florida places like

1792
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:33,079
that you could do small grows small

1793
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:39,730
little plants and do a bunch of them and

1794
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:42,350
do feminized you know there was a huge

1795
01:27:39,729 --> 01:27:43,879
cartel that got busted in a National

1796
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:46,760
Forest around here running a bunch of

1797
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,199
autoflow exactly in my opinion that's

1798
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,720
where they originally started trade auto

1799
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:51,769
they wrote about waste I just flower you

1800
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:54,350
know so they could just line them up

1801
01:27:51,770 --> 01:28:00,440
they did a plot of like 50 feet by 50

1802
01:27:54,350 --> 01:28:02,630
feet here and then wait three weeks on

1803
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:04,789
the internet and different hearsay about

1804
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:06,170
where flowers originally came from where

1805
01:28:04,789 --> 01:28:07,310
they're came from low rider this that

1806
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:08,960
and the other and that's really truly

1807
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,180
where it came from Jeff was the Mexican

1808
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,130
drug cartels and they learn how to they

1809
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:16,130
started breeding their own cannabis with

1810
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:18,170
Kansas City did we basically him yeah

1811
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,909
ruderalis ruderalis to get us the flower

1812
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,350
automatic automatic absolutely and they

1813
01:28:19,909 --> 01:28:23,119
figured out they could get three seasons

1814
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:25,250
a year in the same time and push it

1815
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:27,890
and that's why this mag just became even

1816
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:30,350
more swag gear and to this day though

1817
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:34,000
what we're seeing is a good thing you

1818
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:34,000
know whoever seemed to push it that away

1819
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:39,710
not even worth a dime coming over the

1820
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:41,419
border it's exactly the opposite of what

1821
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:44,119
the government said would happen yeah

1822
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,140
yeah they're actually but it pissed them

1823
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:47,149
off I hear that they're doing other

1824
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:48,710
things to like try to make more money

1825
01:28:47,149 --> 01:28:49,969
and get back at us now because they're

1826
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,359
mad but of course that's how they're

1827
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:55,730
gonna roll right they're stealing lines

1828
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:58,099
as far as indoors growing Otto's indoors

1829
01:28:55,729 --> 01:29:03,259
you're saving two weeks yeah better a

1830
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:04,850
bed you know we've talked about in the

1831
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:07,970
show then you'll get that same way or

1832
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:09,200
better phenotype selection yeah you

1833
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:16,520
can't clone your Otto flowers what if

1834
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:19,639
you find really great Otto powers and

1835
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,130
good experience ours it was it was it

1836

leave that party sorry y'all but that's

1871
01:30:39,408 --> 01:30:45,679
what we do so you guys you're both from

1872
01:30:42,649 --> 01:30:47,210
different states you grew in other

1873
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:49,069
states where it was crazy and now you

1874
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:52,880
came here and you're able to set up shop

1875
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:54,529
and grow and do your breeding thing the

1876
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,139
breeding laws here it's kind of gray

1877
01:30:54,529 --> 01:31:00,939
area the breeding but they keep changing

1878
01:30:57,139 --> 01:31:00,940
the rules everywhere we moved to grow

1879
01:31:07,449 --> 01:31:10,568
[Music]

1880
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,359
[Music]

1881
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:24,739
cannabis growing it I think goes Rolo

1882
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:28,300
something that you really love to do who

1883
01:31:24,738 --> 01:31:28,299
is the government to tell you that

1884
01:31:34,599 --> 01:31:38,360
things like that so I really don't have

1885
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:41,658
to worry about the new but the ordinance

1886
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:51,170
is now with the you know like pueblos no

1887
01:31:41,658 --> 01:31:53,238
more outdoor growing dank outside and

1888
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:54,618
they just had six foot tall plants over

1889
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:56,388
the fence that smelled all the way down

1890
01:31:54,618 --> 01:31:58,569
to the high school down the street so

1891
01:31:56,389 --> 01:32:01,429
that pissed off kind of a few people

1892
01:31:58,569 --> 01:32:03,049
never asked anybody on the show if you

1893
01:32:01,429 --> 01:32:28,340
had to pick one either growing or

1894
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:31,659
smoking it's not it's a learning - it's

1895
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:34,788
a fun experience just like play drums

1896
01:32:31,658 --> 01:32:37,460
that release release that you get in

1897
01:32:34,788 --> 01:32:39,429
your energy going into a good thing you

1898
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:42,020
know and you can help other people

1899
01:32:39,429 --> 01:33:47,090
exactly I can be in the worst mood

1900
01:32:42,020 --> 01:33:49,280
and I don't usually gets been cool I

1901
01:33:47,090 --> 01:34:08,329
appreciate if you guys approve that

1902
01:33:49,279 --> 01:34:35,779
means it's good other than Colorado I

1903

in high-pressure sodium I really like it

2000
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:42,489
that's what I've been rolling with a

2001
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:49,090
little while now and unfortunately this

2002
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:52,738
was no seaweed the seeded plants make a

2003
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:52,739
different kind of a cannabinoid spectrum

2004
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,889
[Music]

2005
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:07,808
completely think that we make out of all

2006
01:42:05,889 --> 01:42:13,269
the plants that I run that have seeds in

2007
01:42:07,809 --> 01:42:20,529
a week and all of it because why not we

2008
01:42:13,269 --> 01:42:22,659
just the way we do it yeah yeah it's you

2009
01:42:20,529 --> 01:42:24,609
higher it gets you at different it's

2010
01:42:22,658 --> 01:42:26,859
like a full-bodied high you get the head

2011
01:42:24,609 --> 01:42:28,868
high the body high high high you get

2012
01:42:26,859 --> 01:42:30,368
cottonmouth it seems like all those

2013
01:42:28,868 --> 01:42:31,448
cannabinoids are in there when you let

2014
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:33,969
the plants eat itself

2015

01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:25,289
handout printed material all right this

2246
01:53:24,149 --> 01:53:27,509
is a two-page article I have to click

2247
01:53:25,289 --> 01:53:28,619
back a couple pages to find page two

2248
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:30,239
because I just found this on Hitman

2249
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:32,939
glass Dougie's Instagram so I'm reading

2250
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:34,170
a picture of this letter honestly but I

2251
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:38,659
want to recap kind of what part of this

2252
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:42,329
says they're saying basically that

2253
01:53:38,659 --> 01:53:44,579
they're saying that you can't take your

2254
01:53:42,329 --> 01:53:47,460
cannabis that was produced in a

2255
01:53:44,579 --> 01:53:49,829
dispensary grow to these events and

2256
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:51,750
share it smoke it consume it and show it

2257
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:54,649
off at these events it has to stay in

2258
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:56,810
the confines of that regulated building

2259
01:53:54,649 --> 01:53:58,399
so

2260
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:01,039
they can't take that cannabis there

2261
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:02,210
which means the dispensaries the larger

2262
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:05,119
dispensaries that have paid a lot of

2263
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:07,640
money for booths can cannot go display

2264
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:10,010
their product um typically these booths

2265
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:11,990
would be smoking you down with dabs

2266
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:13,909
they'd be smoking you down with flowers

2267
01:54:11,989 --> 01:54:15,500
there would be a line you would get to

2268
01:54:13,909 --> 01:54:17,930
taste all of the major dispensaries and

2269
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:21,109
Colorado's products now the media is

2270
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:22,789
saying no you cannot do that they have

2271
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:24,979
also said that they're going to be there

2272
01:54:22,789 --> 01:54:26,479
in force to enforce this to make sure

2273
01:54:24,979 --> 01:54:28,369
this happens it's not in this letter

2274
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:30,619
that's just the talk around this letter

2275
01:54:28,369 --> 01:54:32,449
they have verified yes we're not [ __ ]

2276
01:54:30,619 --> 01:54:34,069
around we're coming to to kind of put

2277
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:36,109
some pressure on you then there's that

2278
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:37,340
short paragraph medical or retail

2279
01:54:36,109 --> 01:54:39,469
marijuana license the owners or

2280
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:41,329
employees should not use personally

2281
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:42,980
purchased flour or products as a mean to

2282
01:54:41,329 --> 01:54:45,260
avoid the intent of the statute and

2283
01:54:42,979 --> 01:54:47,569
regulation prohibiting off-premises

2284
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:49,400
display and sale of marijuana and that

2285
01:54:47,569 --> 01:54:50,719
sounds like a lot of weirdness if you

2286
01:54:49,399 --> 01:54:54,889
don't catch on to what that says that

2287
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:56,750
means that if a dispensary owner knows a

2288
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:57,950
private drummer like myself I'm a

2289
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:00,979
private drawer I have a private

2290
01:54:57,949 --> 01:55:03,470
caregiver TRO he cannot buy a pound of

2291
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:05,479
product from me and put it in his

2292
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:08,270
dispensary display at the Cannabis Cup

2293
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:10,369
he cannot do that should not use

2294
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:13,430
personally purchased flour or product as

2295
01:55:10,369 --> 01:55:17,449
it means to avoid the intent so if they

2296
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:18,890
find product there you're they're gonna

2297
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:20,630
be upset about it you're gonna be in

2298
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:22,550
violation some way because you're

2299
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:25,369
violating either the transportation law

2300
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:27,470
and taking it out of the closed system

2301
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:29,000
that they have invented here or you're

2302
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:31,010
gonna be in violation because you have

2303
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,720
now purchased some outside system

2304
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:34,190
cannabis and brought it into the system

2305
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,659
so they're definitely gonna find a way

2306
01:55:34,189 --> 01:55:37,039
to screw us let me find page two that's

2307
01:55:35,659 --> 01:55:39,289
what I'm kind of stumbling into here

2308
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:40,699
there we go all right oh there was

2309
01:55:39,289 --> 01:55:42,170
another paragraph on the end of page one

2310
01:55:40,699 --> 01:55:44,869
that I have to start with let's find

2311
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:47,289
that it says but in order to diminish

2312
01:55:44,869 --> 01:55:49,488
the

2313
01:55:47,289 --> 01:55:51,710
potential for improper conduct at an

2314
01:55:49,488 --> 01:55:53,899
event or festival Colorado licensees are

2315
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:56,210
strongly encouraged to locate any booth

2316
01:55:53,899 --> 01:56:00,019
or exhibit table in an area away from

2317
01:55:56,210 --> 01:56:01,850
separated Oh in an area away from and

2318
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,199
separated from any area designated for

2319
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:05,989
consumption of marijuana

2320
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:08,089
similarly licensees are encouraged to

2321
01:56:05,988 --> 01:56:10,759
avoid any participation in which the

2322
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:13,699
licensee might appear to be facilitating

2323
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:14,989
potentially illegal conduct so they know

2324
01:56:13,698 --> 01:56:16,189
that there's gonna be consumption at

2325
01:56:14,988 --> 01:56:18,979
some of these events and they're saying

2326
01:56:16,189 --> 01:56:22,609
that they want you if you are an MEP

2327
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:24,769
regulated business you need to be locate

2328
01:56:22,609 --> 01:56:27,250
any booth or exhibit table and any area

2329
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:29,810
away from and separated from any area

2330
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:30,859
designated for consumption consumption

2331
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:32,300
so they're pretty much saying get the

2332
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:34,130
[ __ ] away from all the cannabis stuff

2333
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:37,789
where people are smoking go far far away

2334
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:40,760
from that the last I heard High Times

2335
01:56:37,789 --> 01:56:42,380
canceled the medical portion of their

2336
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:45,230
party at the Cannabis Cup this year

2337
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:46,579
because they're putting this pressure on

2338
01:56:45,229 --> 01:56:47,988
it and they can't get they couldn't get

2339
01:56:46,579 --> 01:56:49,609
enough medical entries is what somebody

2340
01:56:47,988 --> 01:56:52,039
told me is why they were doing it this

2341
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:53,149
kind of makes sense now what they used

2342
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:55,969
to do was they would have a special

2343
01:56:53,149 --> 01:56:57,500
building designated just for the medical

2344
01:56:55,969 --> 01:56:58,550
entries and it doesn't seem like they're

2345
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:02,119
doing that now but I'm gonna keep

2346
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:04,640
reading this a pursuant to CRS twelve

2347

2349
01:57:05,869 --> 01:57:08,779
all these numbers I'm gonna skip that it

2350
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:10,549
is unlawful for a person to buy sell

2351

01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:25,670

distribution of marijuana or marijuana

2365
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:42,739
concentrate which means if you're

2366
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:46,400
they're giving away cannabis as a booth

2367
01:57:42,738 --> 01:57:49,129
they can arrest you for unlawful

2368
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:51,738
distribution of marijuana or marijuana

2369
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:53,029
concentrate and then it continues to say

2370
01:57:51,738 --> 01:57:54,738
the meed will continue to work with

2371
01:57:53,029 --> 01:57:56,539
Colorado licensees to promote a strong

2372
01:57:54,738 --> 01:57:58,089
and legitimate legitimate regulatory

2373
01:57:56,539 --> 01:58:00,250
framework for the caller

2374
01:57:58,090 --> 01:58:02,289
marijuana industry a medieval hold both

2375
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:04,359
businesses and individual marijuana

2376
01:58:02,289 --> 01:58:06,789
licensees responsible for violations of

2377
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:08,589
state statutes and regulations failure

2378
01:58:06,789 --> 01:58:10,180
to abide by the state the statutes and

2379
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:12,100
regulations may result in a range of

2380
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:14,020
sanctions up to including the suspension

2381
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:16,780
and revocation of marijuana business or

2382
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:18,630
occupational licenses in addition to

2383
01:58:16,779 --> 01:58:20,579
possible criminal charges and penalties

2384
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:22,329
so what they're saying there is

2385
01:58:20,579 --> 01:58:25,059
everybody that works in an Emmy

2386
01:58:22,329 --> 01:58:29,409
deregulated facility has to have an any

2387
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:30,610
deeb a just it's a little green badge

2388
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:32,170
it's got your picture on it it's got

2389
01:58:30,609 --> 01:58:34,059
your name on it and it says marijuana

2390
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:36,550
Enforcement Division and then there are

2391
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:38,170
three different colors there are support

2392
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:40,210
badges which are like usually the

2393
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:43,350
trimmers the blood tenders and stuff and

2394
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:45,520
then there are key badges which are like

2395
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:50,770
people to make decisions is basically

2396
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:53,110
how that goes managers master growers

2397
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:55,540
lead growers those guys are your key

2398
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:57,579
holder badges and then above that is the

2399
01:58:55,539 --> 01:58:59,949
owner badge and those are bright red you

2400
01:58:57,579 --> 01:59:01,779
only see those very rarely but they're

2401
01:58:59,949 --> 01:59:03,819
saying that if you get caught doing

2402
01:59:01,779 --> 01:59:06,609
something stupid at this event they will

2403
01:59:03,819 --> 01:59:08,769
revoke not only the business license but

2404
01:59:06,609 --> 01:59:10,929
they're gonna take away the employee

2405
01:59:08,770 --> 01:59:13,450
Emme deepens which is kind of sketchy

2406
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:15,310

2418
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,900
sign the letter so apparently they're

2419
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:40,529
they're serious about this they're not

2420
01:59:37,899 --> 01:59:40,529
messing around

2421
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:44,980
shout out to dougie if you don't know

2422
01:59:43,149 --> 01:59:46,149
dougie from hit man glass say what's up

2423
01:59:44,979 --> 01:59:47,859
to hit with the cannabis cup give him a

2424
01:59:46,149 --> 01:59:49,449
high five I might put this episode out a

2425
01:59:47,859 --> 01:59:50,920
couple of days early just so that you

2426
01:59:49,449 --> 01:59:53,409
can hear this before the cup you know

2427
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:57,699
this is cup day here but happy 4/20

2428
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:59,380
anyway um Dougie raises the question in

2429
01:59:57,699 --> 02:00:01,269
Colorado here their goal was to regulate

2430
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:05,319
alcohol or regulate cannabis like

2431
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:07,210
alcohol now this does not seem like the

2432
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:09,340
fair way to do it right because when you

2433
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:11,890
go to any event in Colorado you see

2434
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:13,569
Coors everywhere you see Budweiser

2435
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:14,710
it scores everyone because we got a lot

2436
02:00:13,569 --> 02:00:17,139
of course breweries here but you see

2437
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:19,449
Coors you see bud you see Fat Tire you

2438
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:21,789
see so many beer ads everywhere you go

2439
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:23,679
in Colorado and if you go to like the

2440
02:00:21,789 --> 02:00:25,750
food festivals if you go to a football

2441
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:29,530
game a baseball game there are beer ads

2442
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:31,689
now what's wrong with having cannabis

2443
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:33,969
people cannabis businesses at cannabis

2444
02:00:31,689 --> 02:00:36,579
events if we're gonna go do beer events

2445
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:38,199
where we serve beer everywhere it's just

2446
02:00:36,579 --> 02:00:40,390
unfair I think it's hypocritical it's

2447
02:00:38,199 --> 02:00:42,789
not what we asked for it's not what we

2448
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:44,440
voted for we need to find a way of the

2449
02:00:42,789 --> 02:00:46,269
big flaw in all the Colorado laws in my

2450
02:00:44,439 --> 02:00:47,710
opinion is that we can buy cannabis we

2451
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:49,570
can grow cannabis we can possess

2452
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:51,069
cannabis we can have cannabis but the

2453
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:53,109
only place you're really allowed to

2454
02:00:51,069 --> 02:00:55,929
consume cannabis is in your own home

2455
02:00:53,109 --> 02:00:58,089
that's the only legal place in the

2456
02:00:55,930 --> 02:01:00,460
privacy or another person's home or in a

2457
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:02,560
private place and we've tried to have

2458
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,480
events that we've called private but

2459
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,010
then once the cops show up they call it

2460
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:08,139
public and we can't have our daddy vent

2461
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:10,210
or smoke out there anymore so that's the

2462
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:11,800
flaw in our law is having some more

2463
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:13,390
legal to smoke and being able to have

2464
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:15,820
these booths come and bring their wares

2465
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:18,010
and advertised heavily kind of sucks if

2466
02:01:15,819 --> 02:01:19,659
they're tracking down this might be this

2467
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:21,070
year could set a precedent for how the

2468
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:24,519
cups are gonna go in the future they may

2469
02:01:21,069 --> 02:01:25,599
change things I hope it goes well guys

2470
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,890
if you're going to the cannabis cup be

2471
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:28,210
safe I'm gonna put this episode out a

2472
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:31,840
couple days early is what I feel like I

2473
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:33,220
need to do but please be safe please be

2474
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:35,980

caregivers a new Senate bill would

2656
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:07,329
eliminate the caregiver to create

2657
02:08:05,069 --> 02:08:09,849

2693
02:09:24,578 --> 02:09:29,049
ago they can't even count I've talked

2694
02:09:26,889 --> 02:09:30,939
about it on the show I didn't realize

2695
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:33,070
but I hit my head twice I told you guys

2696
02:09:30,939 --> 02:09:34,539
my head right but I hit my head but then

2697
02:09:33,069 --> 02:09:35,889
I fell down some stairs and at the

2698
02:09:34,538 --> 02:09:37,509
bottom of the stairs I hit my head again

2699
02:09:35,889 --> 02:09:38,979
I just found on the back of my head a

2700
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:43,329
few days ago I found a nice wall on the

2701
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:45,429
back there too I was a lot more [ __ ]

2702
02:09:43,328 --> 02:09:47,768
up than I realized you guys I recorded

2703
02:09:45,429 --> 02:09:50,078
two podcast with Mike and Adam they are

2704
02:09:47,769 --> 02:09:52,179
fuzzy to me I don't a lot of that stuff

2705
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:53,828
that guy talking wasn't completely Ross

2706
02:09:52,179 --> 02:09:56,739
to Jeff that's kind of my subconscious

2707
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:58,448
doing it's working on those episodes the

2708
02:09:56,738 --> 02:09:59,948
show with can adventure with rusty and

2709
02:09:58,448 --> 02:10:01,029
Rob I feel like it was kind of getting

2710
02:09:59,948 --> 02:10:03,609
my [ __ ] back together but there are

2711
02:10:01,029 --> 02:10:04,779
moments in that podcast where I don't

2712
02:10:03,609 --> 02:10:07,208
know what the [ __ ] was going on to tell

2713
02:10:04,779 --> 02:10:08,349
you the truth I hope you guys couldn't

2714
02:10:07,208 --> 02:10:10,238
tell I hope the shows have been all

2715
02:10:08,349 --> 02:10:12,550
right but I'm kind of feeling like I'm

2716
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:14,288
getting back together my brain is kind

2717
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:17,349
of unscrambling itself sometimes I

2718
02:10:14,288 --> 02:10:19,268
forget dumb stuff like my house if I'm

2719
02:10:17,349 --> 02:10:20,769
going to certain people's houses I have

2720
02:10:19,269 --> 02:10:22,689
to think about when I pull out of the

02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:50,799

2765
02:11:48,849 --> 02:11:52,689
shops opening up and still new

2766
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:55,090

2773
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:09,279
operates a shop in central Denver and

2774
02:12:07,238 --> 02:12:11,348
it's brand new flagship store in Aurora

2775
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:13,448

Denver shop wellspring while these guys

2777
02:12:13,448 --> 02:12:17,799
are rolling the activity in Aurora has

2778
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:19,479
helped to boost those sales and tax

2779
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:21,458
numbers and people are also getting more

2780
02:12:19,479 --> 02:12:23,289
comfortable with purchasing legally

2781
02:12:21,458 --> 02:12:25,029
knowing that it's available and becoming

2782
02:12:23,288 --> 02:12:27,819
a bit more mainstream and that's helping

2783
02:12:25,029 --> 02:12:29,078
sales to which guys people were afraid

2784
02:12:27,819 --> 02:12:30,849
to go into the stores and buy

2785
02:12:29,078 --> 02:12:32,139
recreational cannabis for some reason

2786
02:12:30,849 --> 02:12:35,050
people were afraid of medical cannabis

2787
02:12:32,139 --> 02:12:38,168
for a long time but it seems like people

2788
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:39,610
are kind of getting excited about it now

2789
02:12:38,168 --> 02:12:41,288
there was one group of people that was a

2790
02:12:39,609 --> 02:12:42,728
dispenser that were dispensary

2791

the dispensary and some people just

2793
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:49,719
seemed can choose to get in there so the

2794
02:12:47,168 --> 02:12:51,969

two months of 2015's recreational and

2831
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:14,820
medical numbers suggest that Colorado

2832
02:14:12,899 --> 02:14:18,269
will sell more marijuana and collect

2833
02:14:14,819 --> 02:14:21,929
more and pot related taxes in 2015 than

2834
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:25,260
it did in 2014 you know I can support

2835
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:26,579
that I'm uh I'm the drawer at the spot

2836
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,199
now and we're still working on the grows

2837
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:30,449
and getting everything in place but I'm

2838
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:31,920
there often in meetings and talking

2839
02:14:30,449 --> 02:14:33,149
about where to put this and how to do

2840
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:36,149
that and where we're gonna do everything

2841
02:14:33,149 --> 02:14:37,829
and who's gonna do what but when I'm

2842
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:39,389
there I see the sales happening and they

2843
02:14:37,829 --> 02:14:41,880
are getting busier than ever

2844
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:43,800
busier than ever and I also hang out

2845
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:45,150
excuse me I also hang out with my good

2846
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:48,449
friends at Green and healthy wellness

2847
02:14:45,149 --> 02:14:50,819
and I see those guys getting busier than

2848
02:14:48,449 --> 02:14:52,260
ever so more and more people are buying

2849
02:14:50,819 --> 02:14:54,569
cannabis and there are more shops

2850
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:57,539
popping up and with more shops popping

2851
02:14:54,569 --> 02:15:00,599
up around us and the spot staying as

2852
02:14:57,539 --> 02:15:02,189
busy as it is that tells me that all

2853
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:03,450
those other shops have to be selling

2854
02:15:02,189 --> 02:15:05,579
stuff too because people go check out

2855
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:07,289
new places and I feel like a lot of the

2856
02:15:05,579 --> 02:15:08,789
people that come from out of state they

2857
02:15:07,289 --> 02:15:11,220
know they can only buy seven grams at

2858
02:15:08,789 --> 02:15:12,538
one shop so they probably go visit

2859
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:15,179
several shops and

2860
02:15:12,538 --> 02:15:16,710
area there are a lot of them I have lost

2861
02:15:15,179 --> 02:15:19,408
count how many are out in Pueblo West

2862
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:20,969
right now so the shops are getting busy

2863
02:15:19,408 --> 02:15:22,319
they're staying busy it's only gonna get

2864
02:15:20,969 --> 02:15:24,689
busier we're only gonna bring in more

2865
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:25,948
money for the schools they have actually

2866
02:15:24,689 --> 02:15:27,238
fixed a bunch of potholes in my

2867
02:15:25,948 --> 02:15:29,488

2868
02:15:27,238 --> 02:15:31,859

2869
02:15:29,488 --> 02:15:33,268

2883
02:15:59,819 --> 02:16:03,599
getting lost in the crowd if there's one

2884
02:16:01,979 --> 02:16:06,299
thing he knows how to do it stand out

2885
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:07,769
this time on a pizza box Calipari has

2886
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:09,809
been harnessing the natural delivery

2887
02:16:07,769 --> 02:16:13,289
system of one of several businesses he

2888
02:16:09,809 --> 02:16:15,570
co-owns sexy pizza pizza can I see pizza

2889
02:16:13,288 --> 02:16:17,399
I love pizza is hard to say sexy pizza

2890
02:16:15,569 --> 02:16:18,929
which is three locations in central

2891
02:16:17,399 --> 02:16:21,058
Denver neighborhoods by affixing

2892
02:16:18,929 --> 02:16:23,190
campaign flyers two pizza boxes before

2893
02:16:21,059 --> 02:16:25,769
they're sent out to customers Calipari

2894
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:27,868
says he printed 5000 campaign Flyers for

2895
02:16:25,769 --> 02:16:30,449
the boxes enough to last about two weeks

2896
02:16:27,868 --> 02:16:32,398
at the pizza shops the Pete's the peace

2897
02:16:30,448 --> 02:16:34,739
pictures Calipari under the words I'm a

2898
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:36,869
real person he's running against four

2899
02:16:34,739 --> 02:16:39,510
others for two at-large seats in the May

2900
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:42,260
5th election incumbent Debbie Ortega and

2901
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:45,120
Robin can each our fellow challengers

2902
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:46,349
Joe Silvia and Jeffrey Washington oh and

2903
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,880
fellow challengers sorry I read that

2904
02:16:46,349 --> 02:16:51,389
word wrong and fellow challengers Joe

2905
02:16:47,879 --> 02:16:52,858
Silva and Jeffrey Washington so far a

2906
02:16:51,388 --> 02:16:54,420
khalid bari excuse me I got to take a

2907
02:16:52,859 --> 02:16:55,559
drink my throat's all clogged up let's

2908
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:57,590
go for some water this time I think that

2909
02:16:55,558 --> 02:16:59,779
root beers will clog me

2910
02:16:57,590 --> 02:17:01,790
all right that's better so far a caller

2911
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:03,769
Bari who also Co owns Denver relief the

2912
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:05,059
city's oldest marijuana dispensary has

2913
02:17:03,769 --> 02:17:06,800
raised some eyebrows among fellow

2914
02:17:05,058 --> 02:17:08,989
candidates by missing candidate forums

2915
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:10,819
though he says he had conflicts and

2916
02:17:08,989 --> 02:17:13,340
plans to begin participating in some

2917
02:17:10,819 --> 02:17:15,558
upcoming events his pizza box Flyers are

2918
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:16,909
unorthodox campaigning where it gets a

2919
02:17:15,558 --> 02:17:18,920
little squishy is that under Denver

2920
02:17:16,909 --> 02:17:21,079
Election Code Calabar II must report

2921
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:23,148
sexy pizza's seating of the cardboard

2922
02:17:21,079 --> 02:17:27,319
real estate and arguably the delivery

2923
02:17:23,148 --> 02:17:29,179
service as an in-kind contribution he

2924
02:17:27,319 --> 02:17:31,489
says he plans to do so but it's unclear

2925
02:17:29,179 --> 02:17:33,379
what that's worth Denver leads it up

2926
02:17:31,489 --> 02:17:35,058
leaves it up to candidates to assign a

2927
02:17:33,379 --> 02:17:37,369
fair market value that's reasonable

2928
02:17:35,058 --> 02:17:39,170
Calipari says he's bowling that over and

2929
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:41,570
will probably rate the value at a penny

2930
02:17:39,170 --> 02:17:43,069
or two per flyer or fifty to a hundred

2931
02:17:41,569 --> 02:17:46,039
dollars total on his next campaign

2932
02:17:43,069 --> 02:17:48,189
finance report he says that's reasonable

2933
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:51,080
because he's used sexy pizzas boxes

2934
02:17:48,189 --> 02:17:52,819
Sexy's sexy pizzas boxes to promote his

2935
02:17:51,079 --> 02:17:55,250
other businesses including Denver relief

2936
02:17:52,819 --> 02:17:57,709
and sex pot comedy shows as well as

2937
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:59,510
partners events at no charge he pointed

2938
02:17:57,709 --> 02:18:01,789
out that his campaign volunteers not

2939
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:04,130
sexy pieces employees are attaching the

2940
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:05,450
Flyers to the boxes in advance so

2941
02:18:04,129 --> 02:18:07,489
technically he's not really using the

2942
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:10,130
pizza shop employees he's using his own

2943
02:18:07,489 --> 02:18:15,409
guys so he's not using the pizza shop as

2944
02:18:10,129 --> 02:18:17,058
like slave labor that's political crap

2945
02:18:15,409 --> 02:18:18,769
you have to worry about so Bob perhaps

2946
02:18:17,058 --> 02:18:21,079
it was inevitable that Calipari would

2947
02:18:18,769 --> 02:18:23,300
attempt such synergy and his run for

2948
02:18:21,079 --> 02:18:24,709
Denver City Council this is after all

2949
02:18:23,299 --> 02:18:26,808
the same guy who tried to make a point

2950
02:18:24,709 --> 02:18:28,968
and mock Governor John Hickenlooper a

2951
02:18:26,808 --> 02:18:30,679
former beer Brewer who opposed pot

2952
02:18:28,968 --> 02:18:32,209
legalization by following him around in

2953
02:18:30,679 --> 02:18:33,500
a chicken suit there's a picture of the

2954
02:18:32,209 --> 02:18:36,049
student a chicken suit smoking a spliff

2955
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:38,420
on a couch it's pretty funny it says but

2956
02:18:36,049 --> 02:18:40,218
his mailers his mailer strike a more

2957
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:41,530
serious tone highlighting Calot baris

2958
02:18:40,218 --> 02:18:44,178
business experience as an entrepreneur

2959
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:46,429
who started or helped start several

2960
02:18:44,179 --> 02:18:48,019
local businesses and making the claim I

2961
02:18:46,429 --> 02:18:49,638
have more business experience than all

2962
02:18:48,019 --> 02:18:52,040
current city council members combined

2963
02:18:49,638 --> 02:18:54,679
he's careful to mention his ownership of

2964
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:57,700
the marijuana shop in passing below his

2965
02:18:54,679 --> 02:19:00,319
support for LGBT and transgender gender

2966
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:03,000
transgendered rights and his position as

2967
02:19:00,319 --> 02:19:04,648
an opponent of greedy developers

2968
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,318
he's drawn more serious fundraising

2969
02:19:04,648 --> 02:19:09,000
support lately how out raising the other

2970
02:19:07,318 --> 02:19:12,718
four candidates in March by collecting

2971
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:16,700
22,000 $383 though he still trails the

2972
02:19:12,718 --> 02:19:19,289
incumbent overall totals significantly

2973
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:21,899
that this article is written weird right

2974
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:23,189
here it hard to say it is hard to say if

2975
02:19:21,898 --> 02:19:25,648
he's rounding up enough support to

2976
02:19:23,189 --> 02:19:28,019
threaten Ortega ork niche on May 5th but

2977
02:19:25,648 --> 02:19:30,209
Calipari always exudes confidence he

2978
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:32,398
noted that the pizza box Flyers amount

2979
02:19:30,209 --> 02:19:34,978
to a fraction of his efforts we're going

2980
02:19:32,398 --> 02:19:36,718
to end up doing right around 70,000

2981
02:19:34,978 --> 02:19:38,579
mailers he said they're going to go to

2982
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,339
various demographics and we're making a

2983
02:19:38,579 --> 02:19:42,840
couple thousand phone calls the social

2984
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:44,939
media is really what I'm getting a kick

2985
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,068
out right now so this articles first

2986
02:19:44,939 --> 02:19:48,960
published on the Denver Post calm I

2987
02:19:47,068 --> 02:19:51,269
think it's great that this guy who is

2988
02:19:48,959 --> 02:19:53,068
part owner of a dispensary owns a pizza

2989
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:55,260
joint and is running for office in

2990
02:19:53,068 --> 02:19:56,309
Denver is attaching his fliers to pizza

2991
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:59,609
boxes you're hitting your target

2992
02:19:56,309 --> 02:20:01,590
audience it's perfect I'm sorry about

2993
02:19:59,609 --> 02:20:04,500

2995

3011

episode we're gonna do an article we

3012
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:45,329
read article about special report

3013
02:20:43,799 --> 02:20:48,000
edibles safety still a concern for

3014
02:20:45,329 --> 02:20:49,709
Colorado we'll read that the next

3015
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,559
episode will probably actually come out

3016
02:20:49,709 --> 02:20:54,688
on 4/20 it's not gonna be a really long

3017
02:20:52,559 --> 02:20:56,609
episode either but the one after that

3018
02:20:54,689 --> 02:20:59,340
will be my cannabis cup review episode

3019

the episode after that we are going to

3020
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:03,750
talk about planning your gardens getting

3021
02:21:02,010 --> 02:21:05,488
the schedule for your garden figured out

3022
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:07,620
so that you could be as productive as

3023
02:21:05,488 --> 02:21:08,789
you can be so that you're not behind so

3024
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:11,310
that you're not ahead so that you're not

3025
02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:14,310
missing clones when you need them my

3026
02:21:11,309 --> 02:21:16,840
plan to get Jesse over to do more

3027
02:21:14,309 --> 02:21:19,389
outdoor stuff jesse is a busy man

3028
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:20,380
he's doing his own outdoor stuff so we

3029
02:21:19,389 --> 02:21:22,090

politics pretty soon I've got a couple

3032
02:21:23,648 --> 02:21:26,799
more guests in mind the Cannabis Cup is

3033
02:21:25,569 --> 02:21:28,689
coming so you never know what could

3034
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:31,358
happen at the cup we may talk to some

3035
02:21:28,689 --> 02:21:32,470
people while we're there let's see what

3036
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:34,180

says big fan of the podcast I recently

3156
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:25,340
finished binge listening to the whole

3157
02:27:22,970 --> 02:27:26,989
back catalogue and enjoyed every episode

3158
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:29,090
I'm somewhat disappointed I now have to

3159
02:27:26,989 --> 02:27:31,101
go days between episodes but I'm sure

3160
02:27:29,090 --> 02:27:32,870
I'll cope I have learned a lot from the

3161
02:27:31,101 --> 02:27:34,400
grow lessons with you Jessie and Spence

3162
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:36,170
it's nice to have a lighthouse in the

3163
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:38,090
sea of [ __ ] that is the internet

3164
02:27:36,170 --> 02:27:39,799
forums and I'm glad you pointed that out

3165
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:41,870
because that's part of what inspired me

3166
02:27:39,799 --> 02:27:43,879
to want to do I wanted to write a book

3167
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:45,530
originally but uh I'm too scatterbrained

3168
02:27:43,879 --> 02:27:48,649
to write a damn book so we did a podcast

3169
02:27:45,530 --> 02:27:50,239
and part of my goal was to dispel a

3170
02:27:48,649 --> 02:27:53,239
bunch of the [ __ ] that we see on the

3171
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:54,771
internet and in the forums that's what

3172
02:27:53,239 --> 02:27:57,190
we're trying to do I'm glad you

3173
02:27:54,771 --> 02:27:57,190
appreciate it

3174
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:02,510
a half dozen plants in Bubble buckets

3175
02:27:59,989 --> 02:28:04,039
when I started listening to the G fyh B

3176
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:05,750
list to say I have seen the light and

3177
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,880
I'm gearing up to switch to soil for the

3178
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:11,149
next run I have planned with hopes of

3179
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:13,069
becoming fully organic dude don't worry

3180
02:28:11,149 --> 02:28:14,449
about jumping in fully organic just do

3181
02:28:13,069 --> 02:28:16,119
what you can to get rid of those buckets

3182
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:18,740
and start learning how to work so I'll

3183
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:20,480
read a few books read the TLO book like

3184
02:28:18,739 --> 02:28:21,949
Shawn and I were talking about that'll

3185
02:28:20,479 --> 02:28:23,390
definitely get you started read teeming

3186
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:26,061
with microbes that'll get you a good

3187
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:27,739
start don't go to don't try to be too

3188
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:29,659
hardcore about going fully organic right

3189
02:28:27,739 --> 02:28:31,851
away learn how to grow and adjust solely

3190
02:28:29,659 --> 02:28:33,920
and we just want you to get there when

3191
02:28:31,851 --> 02:28:35,569
you're ready to say I would like to gain

3192
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:37,700
some more insight and perspective from

3193
02:28:35,569 --> 02:28:39,319
you on indoor soil setups you've

3194
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:40,909
mentioned you hand water plants most of

3195
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:43,190
the time does this consist of literally

3196
02:28:40,909 --> 02:28:45,771
pouring the water to each plant or some

3197
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:46,909
other system I am misunderstanding many

3198
02:28:45,771 --> 02:28:48,260
goes on it says thank you for your time

3199

and effort looking forward to getting my

3200
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:53,479
hands on some IRA genetics as soon as

3201
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:56,090
they hit n gr let me go with that first

3202
02:28:53,479 --> 02:28:59,420
paragraph they're hand watering yes I

3203
02:28:56,090 --> 02:29:01,790
mix my so I run my personal caregiver

3204
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:03,979
grows our soil grows so I will mix my

3205
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:06,050
nutrients into a large container

3206
02:29:03,979 --> 02:29:07,819
honestly my big batches are mixed up in

3207
02:29:06,049 --> 02:29:09,379
a Rubbermaid trash can that's how much I

3208
02:29:07,819 --> 02:29:11,601
mix in I've got a mark where it's 25

3209
02:29:09,379 --> 02:29:14,000
gallons I mix up a twenty five gallon

3210
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:15,681
batch I'll adjust the pH if I'm using

3211
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,931
organics you can't [ __ ] with the pH too

3212
02:29:15,681 --> 02:29:19,340
much you have to accept what it is if

3213
02:29:17,931 --> 02:29:19,761
you're using synthetic nutrients go

3214
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:23,181
ahead and

3215
02:29:19,761 --> 02:29:25,461
your pH I use a one-gallon pitcher just

3216
02:29:23,181 --> 02:29:27,890
like you'd get at Target or wherever

3217
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:29,149
else you're shopping I like Target just

3218
02:29:27,890 --> 02:29:31,251
stick the picture right in there and

3219
02:29:29,149 --> 02:29:33,290
pour it right into the plant that way I

3220
02:29:31,251 --> 02:29:34,911
have a good gauge of how much I'm

3221
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:37,161
putting into each plant I can say this

3222
02:29:34,911 --> 02:29:39,110
plant prefers 1/2 a gallon this plant

3223
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:40,161
prefers a whole gallon can kind of

3224
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:41,931
measure that way so yeah I'm actually

3225
02:29:40,161 --> 02:29:44,240
hand watering just by using a pitcher

3226
02:29:41,931 --> 02:29:46,131
and dumping it into the plant I run

3227
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:48,831
seven gallon pots or my favorites to use

3228
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:50,510
and each 7 gallon pot takes a gallon of

3229
02:29:48,831 --> 02:29:51,831
water it's a perfect mathematical

3230
02:29:50,511 --> 02:29:54,110
equation to know how many gallons you

3231
02:29:51,831 --> 02:29:56,451
need gotta know it's easy for me so

3232
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:58,881
never a stupid question that was a great

3233
02:29:56,450 --> 02:30:00,260
question glad you asked also dude thanks

3234
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:02,390

night before last I guess we'll talk

3256
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:47,359
about that I got the honor to go see one

3257
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:49,311
of my favorite reggae bands in the whole

3258
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:51,831
world I got to go see Morgan heritage at

3259
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:55,550
servantes other side in Denver Colorado

3260
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:56,630
I drove the 2 hour drive by myself a lot

3261
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:58,490
of people are like dude you drive up

3262
02:30:56,630 --> 02:31:00,319

3263
02:30:58,490 --> 02:31:03,380
listen to a podcast take a couple dad's

3264
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:04,460
before I leave and it's a great trip and

3265
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:05,840
then when you get there you get to a

3266
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:07,430
reggae show and I'm a white guy with

3267
02:31:05,841 --> 02:31:09,381
dreadlocks to my butt and a lot of the

3268
02:31:07,431 --> 02:31:11,121
reggae scene knows me I was there for 10

3269
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:12,140
minutes by myself before I made friends

3270
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:14,330
and bumped into people that I already

3271
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:14,870
knew so it was not even going by myself

3272
02:31:14,331 --> 02:31:17,810
really

3273
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:18,859
so Morgan heritage came out dude that

3274
02:31:17,810 --> 02:31:21,411
man tore it up

3275
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:22,641
Morgan heritage is on fire right now if

3276
02:31:21,411 --> 02:31:24,831
you're into reggae if you like good

3282
02:31:32,390 --> 02:31:35,689
albums they did

3283
02:31:33,469 --> 02:31:37,728
pretty much if I made a Morgan heritage

3284
02:31:35,689 --> 02:31:40,670
playlist they would have played it last

3285
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:41,898
night it was perfect so a big shout out

3286
02:31:40,670 --> 02:31:43,639
to Morgan heritage big shout out to

3287
02:31:41,898 --> 02:31:45,769
servantes other side also big shout out

3288
02:31:43,639 --> 02:31:47,349
to Carlos and his crews good hanging out

3289
02:31:45,770 --> 02:31:50,180
you guys made me feel like I was at home

3290
02:31:47,350 --> 02:31:52,818
so here's where my night got really

3291
02:31:50,180 --> 02:31:54,409
interesting I walked out of excuse me I

3292
02:31:52,818 --> 02:31:58,309
walked out of the venue from seeing the

3293
02:31:54,409 --> 02:31:59,659
concert and the band was kind of

3294
02:31:58,309 --> 02:32:00,920
gathering up by their tour bus across

3295
02:31:59,659 --> 02:32:02,148
the street and I couldn't see them

3296
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:03,260
because the tour bus is long and they're

3297
02:32:02,148 --> 02:32:05,568
on the other side so I walked to the

3298
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:08,840
corner where I could just casually lean

3299
02:32:05,568 --> 02:32:10,728
against a parking meter and stare into

3300
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:12,318
the Denver skyline and kind of see the

3301
02:32:10,728 --> 02:32:16,129
band hanging out by their tour bus doing

3302
02:32:12,318 --> 02:32:17,600
their thing it was a nice night it was

3303
02:32:16,129 --> 02:32:19,129
cold but it was nice after being in the

3304
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:21,729
concert it was nice to get some fresh

3305
02:32:19,129 --> 02:32:24,379
air so I'm standing in the corner and

3306
02:32:21,728 --> 02:32:26,209
the light turns red and a car stops in

3307
02:32:24,379 --> 02:32:29,119
front of me car stops in the Far Lane

3308
02:32:26,209 --> 02:32:32,000
and then a car stops behind that car and

3309
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:33,710
rolls down the window and the guy in the

3310
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,350
driver's seat yells hey [ __ ] you

3311
02:32:33,709 --> 02:32:38,688
dreadlocks and I'm just standing on the

3312
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:42,200
corner in downtown Denver by myself at

3313
02:32:38,689 --> 02:32:44,479
five points like 2:00 in the morning and

3314
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:48,380
I think to myself this is about to get

3315
02:32:44,478 --> 02:32:50,179
sketchy as [ __ ] so I reach into my

3316
02:32:48,379 --> 02:32:51,619
pockets to see what I've got I've got a

3317
02:32:50,180 --> 02:32:54,020
little bit of weed I've got a little bit

3318
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:55,160
of dabs in my pocket I got my cell phone

3319
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:56,359
I got my keys I don't really have

3320
02:32:55,159 --> 02:32:59,238
anything that's gonna help me out in

3321
02:32:56,359 --> 02:33:01,340
this position I had money in my pocket

3322
02:32:59,238 --> 02:33:02,629
and I had my we're gonna do is kick my

3323
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:04,880
ass and take my weed and money is what I

3324
02:33:02,629 --> 02:33:05,929
was assuming so I tried to ignore them I

3325
02:33:04,879 --> 02:33:07,608
don't know why I thought being an

3326
02:33:05,930 --> 02:33:10,159
ostrich would help just ignore him and

3327
02:33:07,609 --> 02:33:11,359
they'll go away right but uh the dude

3328
02:33:10,159 --> 02:33:13,340
rolled down his window a little further

3329
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:14,779
and he yelled another derogatory term

3330
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:17,000
about white guys with dreadlocks I can't

3331
02:33:14,779 --> 02:33:19,010
remember exactly it didn't that wasn't

3332
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,510
what I was worried about but I could

3333
02:33:19,010 --> 02:33:22,040
look into the car and see that it was

3334
02:33:20,510 --> 02:33:23,630
fool there were at least four or five

3335
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:26,239
maybe six people in that car and they

3336
02:33:23,629 --> 02:33:29,000
were talking mad [ __ ] to me so the dude

3337
02:33:26,238 --> 02:33:30,318
said [ __ ] you Rasta hardly Selassie I is

3338
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,969
what he said to me and that was what I

3339
02:33:30,318 --> 02:33:33,978
was like this guy knows what I'm about

3340
02:33:31,969 --> 02:33:36,199
he knows I'm a Rasta man and he's got

3341
02:33:33,978 --> 02:33:38,510
hatred specifically for Rastafarians

3342
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:40,850
especially white Rastas and that's what

3343
02:33:38,510 --> 02:33:42,680
I am and I'm all by myself so I looked

3344
02:33:40,850 --> 02:33:44,620
down that block to the right and the

3345
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:46,389
concert venue was a good half of

3346
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:48,130
way I look down to the left and there's

3347
02:33:46,389 --> 02:33:49,569
nothing but [ __ ] darkness and I look

3348
02:33:48,129 --> 02:33:52,479
forward and there's a coffee shop that's

3349
02:33:49,569 --> 02:33:55,601
closed this [ __ ] it's me and this

3350
02:33:52,479 --> 02:33:57,399
carload of people and they pulled up to

3351
02:33:55,601 --> 02:33:59,890
the curb and rolled down their window

3352
02:33:57,399 --> 02:34:01,750
and it was [ __ ] Chris Costas from the

3353
02:33:59,889 --> 02:34:03,909
source genetics dude just picking on me

3354
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:05,500
god I was like not sure if I was about

3355
02:34:03,909 --> 02:34:06,940
to fight six people I'm not sure if I

3356
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:08,920

3368
02:34:30,969 --> 02:34:36,629
going to a speakeasy that happens to be

3369
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:38,889
just several feet to the left of you

3370
02:34:36,629 --> 02:34:41,409
walk up the street we'll park and we'll

3371
02:34:38,889 --> 02:34:42,520
meet up so they find a parking spot and

3372
02:34:41,409 --> 02:34:45,670
I have a get out of the car they'll give

3373
02:34:42,521 --> 02:34:46,720

3374
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:47,351
never remember I think her name is

3375
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:49,569
Daniela

3376
02:34:47,351 --> 02:34:51,970
maybe maybe possibly I'm sorry I forgot

3377
02:34:49,569 --> 02:34:56,889

3378
02:34:51,969 --> 02:35:00,789
name I forgot I might have been higher

3379
02:34:56,889 --> 02:35:01,899
[ __ ] so we walk down the street and I

3380
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:03,910
can't disclose the location of this

3381
02:35:01,899 --> 02:35:05,739
place but we walked down the street half

3382
02:35:03,909 --> 02:35:07,239
a block and there was a brown door that

3383
02:35:05,739 --> 02:35:09,610
just looked like a normal door there was

3384
02:35:07,239 --> 02:35:12,479
no there was not an identifying marker

3385
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:14,771
on the building on the door on anything

3386
02:35:12,479 --> 02:35:19,029
one of my friends knocks on the door a

3387
02:35:14,771 --> 02:35:21,311
man opens some blinds and sees us opens

3388
02:35:19,030 --> 02:35:22,989
the door lets us into a small waiting

3389
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:24,459
area I didn't say anything

3390
02:35:22,989 --> 02:35:25,629
I wasn't quite sure what was going on I

3391
02:35:24,459 --> 02:35:30,729
was just a new guy that just tagged

3392
02:35:25,629 --> 02:35:32,889
along they invited me dude hands the guy

3393
02:35:30,729 --> 02:35:34,810
at the door fifty bucks the guy shakes

3394
02:35:32,889 --> 02:35:37,149
his hand and says all of them

3395
02:35:34,810 --> 02:35:39,190
and so another guy comes and leads us to

3396
02:35:37,149 --> 02:35:40,479
a little further down the way and gives

3397
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:43,090
us a little seating area and we all sit

3398
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:44,109
down and I'm not sure what's going on

3399
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:46,120
really I was told that we're going to

3400
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:47,980
this little speakeasy but it was 2:00 in

3401
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:50,320
the morning and they were serving drinks

3402
02:35:47,979 --> 02:35:51,969
in this joint and we sat down and I

3403
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:53,409
rolled I had some flowers on me from the

3404
02:35:51,969 --> 02:35:55,340
concert that I had just been to I rolled

3405
02:35:53,409 --> 02:35:56,959
a nice-sized joint cost

3406
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:59,059
rolled a nice-sized joint and my buddy

3407
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:01,250
jibs started taking dabs of solvent list

3408
02:35:59,059 --> 02:36:02,829
like it was nothing my buddy Mike was to

3409
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:05,209
the right of me he started taking dabs

3410
02:36:02,829 --> 02:36:06,799
dad start going around the joints are

3411
02:36:05,209 --> 02:36:08,228
going around and nobody seemed to carry

3412
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:12,108
we were the only ones puffing in there

3413
02:36:08,228 --> 02:36:15,438
qasas pointed out that may have been a

3414
02:36:12,109 --> 02:36:17,030
gay bar I'm not quite sure I'm sure that

3415
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:19,100
there were some gay folk in there I'm

3416
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:21,320
not sure what qualifies it as a gay bar

3417
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:23,239
but it had definitely a different vibe

3418
02:36:21,319 --> 02:36:24,469
but you know what a [ __ ] ton of fun dude

3419
02:36:23,239 --> 02:36:25,789
there was a pool table in there I don't

3420
02:36:24,469 --> 02:36:27,438
shoot pool but people were shooting pool

3421
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:29,270
having fun they were serving drinks

3422
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:32,059
I stayed there until 4:20 in the morning

3423
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:34,489
I was a great time I never would have

3424
02:36:32,059 --> 02:36:36,228

3441
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:20,449

3443
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:25,460
[ __ ] April in Colorado snowing

3446
02:37:27,859 --> 02:37:31,850

3447
02:37:29,478 --> 02:37:35,329

woke up got a little bit more prepared

3450
02:37:36,739 --> 02:37:41,898
for the cannabis cup and then I drove up

3451
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:44,720
to Colorado Springs to see my buddy

3452

that's enough of me rambling let's talk

3492
02:38:55,889 --> 02:38:59,128
about some news articles where do you

3493
02:38:57,988 --> 02:39:00,809
guys want to start you want to start on

3494
02:38:59,129 --> 02:39:02,159
the serious [ __ ] actually last week I

3495
02:39:00,809 --> 02:39:03,719
told you we were gonna talk about this

3496
02:39:02,158 --> 02:39:05,219
edibles report and I skipped it because

3497
02:39:03,719 --> 02:39:08,068
it was way too long so let's get into

3498
02:39:05,219 --> 02:39:10,559
that this article is from the cannabis

3499
02:39:08,068 --> 02:39:13,228
and it's by Ricardo Baca the headline

3500
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:15,269
says special report 15 months in edibles

3501
02:39:13,228 --> 02:39:16,318
still a safety concern for Colorado I'm

3502
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:19,850
gonna take a quick drink of some root

3503
02:39:16,318 --> 02:39:19,850
beer here and we'll read the article

3504
02:39:21,889 --> 02:39:26,728
alright that's delicious it says a year

3505
02:39:25,168 --> 02:39:28,770
of debate a slew of labeling regulations

3506
02:39:26,728 --> 02:39:29,998
and multiple educational campaigns have

3507
02:39:28,770 --> 02:39:31,529
not been effective in answering a

3508
02:39:29,998 --> 02:39:33,898
critical question surrounding marijuana

3509
02:39:31,529 --> 02:39:37,859
infused edible products how do you stop

3510
02:39:33,898 --> 02:39:39,538
a consumer from eating too much the way

3511
02:39:37,859 --> 02:39:42,748
this is written it's all like super

3512
02:39:39,539 --> 02:39:44,699
impactive edibles once it's not to be

3513
02:39:42,748 --> 02:39:46,049
the simple entry for those who wanted to

3514
02:39:44,699 --> 02:39:47,879
try the newly legalized recreational

3515
02:39:46,049 --> 02:39:49,918
drug have been implicated in two

3516
02:39:47,879 --> 02:39:52,319
suicides and one murder in the past 13

3517
02:39:49,918 --> 02:39:53,878
months only one edibles related death

3518
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:56,100
has been confirmed by officials but the

3519
02:39:53,879 --> 02:39:58,050
family of 22-year old Oklahoma tourist

3520
02:39:56,100 --> 02:40:00,238
Luke Goodman who fatally shot himself

3521
02:39:58,049 --> 02:40:02,188
while on a March ski vacation in

3522
02:40:00,238 --> 02:40:04,469
Keystone immediately blamed his death on

3523
02:40:02,189 --> 02:40:05,880
the infused edibles he over indulged in

3524
02:40:04,469 --> 02:40:08,549
that day

3525
02:40:05,879 --> 02:40:10,109
it was a hundred percent the drugs Kim

3526
02:40:08,549 --> 02:40:11,938
Goldman said at the time acknowledging

3527
02:40:10,110 --> 02:40:13,710
that her son didn't read the government

3528
02:40:11,939 --> 02:40:15,689
mandated warnings on the packaging and

3529
02:40:13,709 --> 02:40:17,959
ended up eating five times the state's

3530
02:40:15,689 --> 02:40:20,398
recommended dose for edible cannabis

3531
02:40:17,959 --> 02:40:22,079
what's the recommended doses a 25 I

3532
02:40:20,398 --> 02:40:24,439
think so that means he ate a hundred and

3533
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:26,728
twenty five milligrams

3534
02:40:24,439 --> 02:40:28,920
100 milligram Claudie bared the other

3535
02:40:26,728 --> 02:40:31,409
night and I was high so if this dude

3536
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:33,120
doesn't do any cannabis consumption

3537
02:40:31,409 --> 02:40:34,680
until this point and he eats 100

3538
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:38,160
milligrams he was probably pretty

3539
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:39,898
[ __ ] high to tell you the truth much

3540
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:41,309
of the regulatory debate around edibles

3541
02:40:39,898 --> 02:40:43,019
has focused on preventing accidental

3542
02:40:41,309 --> 02:40:44,850
ingestion but the manner in which

3543
02:40:43,020 --> 02:40:46,470
edibles affected person raises the

3544
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:48,030
question whether more should be done to

3545
02:40:46,469 --> 02:40:50,188
educate buyers before they leave the

3546
02:40:48,030 --> 02:40:51,720
shop there's a learning curve for

3547
02:40:50,189 --> 02:40:52,950
consumers of edibles that aren't Wei

3548
02:40:51,719 --> 02:40:55,739
Colorado State Director of

3549
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:56,970
pro-legalization drug policy Alliance we

3550
02:40:55,739 --> 02:40:59,280
cannot escape the issue of personal

3551
02:40:56,969 --> 02:41:01,529
responsibility that said the industry

3552
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:02,760
should do all that is reasonable in the

3553
02:41:01,530 --> 02:41:05,100
formative years of marijuana

3554
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:08,610
legalization to combat concerns around

3555
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:10,620
edibles only 5 million edibles were sold

3556
02:41:08,610 --> 02:41:13,530
in Colorado shops in 2014

3557
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:14,790
not only are edibles high ok I'm going

3558
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:16,200
to try that sense again not only are

3559
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:17,610
edibles high is more delayed and

3560
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:19,860
long-lasting than smoking or vaporizing

3561
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:21,420
cannabis but some brands continue to

3562
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:23,430
severely mismeasure their products

3563
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:25,559
potency according to a new Denver Post

3564
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:28,559
commissioned series of lab tests

3565
02:41:25,559 --> 02:41:30,329
measuring th C's and 10 popular edibles

3566
02:41:28,559 --> 02:41:32,100
you guys you'll remember we did a report

3567
02:41:30,329 --> 02:41:34,648
on that way in the infancy of this show

3568
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:37,319
a bunch of the companies were making

3569
02:41:34,648 --> 02:41:38,939
edibles a random person bought them and

3570
02:41:37,319 --> 02:41:40,170
took them to steep hill labs and things

3571
02:41:38,939 --> 02:41:42,450
that were claiming to have a hundred

3572
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:45,600
milligrams we're having 10 and then also

3573
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:47,189
maybe 200 so it was way off the chart so

3574
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:49,079
it's hard to even say what some of these

3575
02:41:47,189 --> 02:41:51,540
people ate when they got all [ __ ] up

3576
02:41:49,079 --> 02:41:54,780
and did stupid stuff where was I in the

3577
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:56,460
article here it is earlier this year it

3578
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:58,739
seemed as if the state's legislative pot

3579
02:41:56,459 --> 02:42:01,139
docket had calmed down after a busting

3580
02:41:58,739 --> 02:42:03,478
bustling 2014 of regulations and

3581
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:04,949
rulemaking 4 edibles alone warning

3582
02:42:03,478 --> 02:42:07,079
labels already had been standardized

3583
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:10,140
with more information 10 milligram doses

3584
02:42:07,079 --> 02:42:12,299
of THC universally universally had

3585
02:42:10,139 --> 02:42:13,949
become individually wrapped the state

3586
02:42:12,299 --> 02:42:15,959
was working on uniform lab testing

3587
02:42:13,950 --> 02:42:17,530
standards and users encountered

3588
02:42:15,959 --> 02:42:19,689
educational campaigns at

3589
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:22,540
return movie theaters pot shops and

3590
02:42:19,690 --> 02:42:24,670
interstate billboards you know I'd I

3591
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:26,021
think that when you're buying edibles I

3592
02:42:24,670 --> 02:42:27,549
think you should be given a pamphlet or

3593
02:42:26,021 --> 02:42:29,891
something would be a good start because

3594
02:42:27,549 --> 02:42:33,189
I've been to a hundred dispensaries I

3595
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:36,670
work at a dispensary and the budtender

3596
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:38,560
will say hey this is serious like take

3597
02:42:36,670 --> 02:42:41,379
this seriously and people don't respect

3598
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:42,851
it they just don't care and so I think

3599
02:42:41,379 --> 02:42:44,890
maybe if you gave him a little papers if

3600
02:42:42,851 --> 02:42:46,810
they could read it most of we're gonna

3601
02:42:44,890 --> 02:42:49,720
throw it away but at least we gave them

3602
02:42:46,810 --> 02:42:51,129
that paper and gave them the opportunity

3603
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:52,479
to read it because when people talk it's

3604
02:42:51,129 --> 02:42:54,069
easy just to ignore us when we're at the

3605
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:55,299
shop you're looking at all the buds

3606
02:42:54,069 --> 02:42:56,440
you're looking at all the concentrates

3607
02:42:55,299 --> 02:42:58,779
you're thinking about how much money you

3608
02:42:56,440 --> 02:43:00,190
can spend you're just excited the money

3609
02:42:58,780 --> 02:43:01,271
comes flying out of your pocket you put

3610
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:02,950
the edibles right in your mouth you

3611
02:43:01,271 --> 02:43:04,210
don't even think so think if we give you

3612
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:05,800
a little piece of paper to read and kind

3613
02:43:04,209 --> 02:43:07,659
of showed you some [ __ ] that might be a

3614
02:43:05,799 --> 02:43:09,010
good start maybe make you sign something

3615
02:43:07,659 --> 02:43:10,209
but then people don't even want to [ __ ]

3616
02:43:09,011 --> 02:43:12,460
around if you have to sign something at

3617
02:43:10,209 --> 02:43:14,829
the dispensary I remember the first time

3618
02:43:12,459 --> 02:43:17,020
I bought a decade dose Chiba chew I was

3619
02:43:14,829 --> 02:43:18,459
when they first first came out my friend

3620
02:43:17,021 --> 02:43:20,141
had a shop and he invited me to get a

3621
02:43:18,459 --> 02:43:22,089
deck of DOS and they made me sign a

3622
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:23,681
waiver to eat a decade dose Chiba Shu I

3623
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:25,000
bought it and actually made me eat it

3624
02:43:23,681 --> 02:43:27,159
there because they didn't want me to

3625
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,620
give it to anybody they told me to eat

3626
02:43:27,159 --> 02:43:31,420
the whole thing in front of them sorry

3627
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:33,370
I'm gonna go on with the article here it

3628
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:34,931
says in the wake of Goldman's death many

3629
02:43:33,370 --> 02:43:36,610
recalled 19 year old Wyoming college

3630
02:43:34,931 --> 02:43:38,471
students Levi's tombo who became

3631
02:43:36,610 --> 02:43:39,940
agitated after eating an infused cookie

3632
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:42,970
with more than 6 times the state's

3633
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:45,011
recommended dose in March 2014 and left

3634
02:43:42,970 --> 02:43:46,930
to his death from a Denver hotel balcony

3635
02:43:45,011 --> 02:43:49,181
the Denver coroner listed medical

3636
02:43:46,931 --> 02:43:51,909
intoxication as a significant condition

3637
02:43:49,181 --> 02:43:53,409
contributing to Thomas death have you

3638
02:43:51,909 --> 02:43:56,560
ever been so high you wanted to jump off

3639
02:43:53,409 --> 02:43:58,030
the balcony that's [ __ ] high as the

3640
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:59,770
summit county coroner awaits Goodman's

3641
02:43:58,030 --> 02:44:01,570
toxicology reports in the coming weeks

3642
02:43:59,771 --> 02:44:03,070
his death may be related to cannabis or

3643
02:44:01,569 --> 02:44:04,690
nas served as a reminder that the

3644
02:44:03,069 --> 02:44:07,000
edibles conversation is anything but

3645
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:08,500
over as we continue down this road we

3646
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,720
really need to keep an open mind said

3647
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:12,549
Luis Coski director of Colorado medical

3648
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:14,109
Oh Colorado's marijuana Enforcement

3649
02:44:12,549 --> 02:44:15,430
Division I'm gonna continue to say

3650
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:16,780
medical marijuana Enforcement Division

3651
02:44:15,431 --> 02:44:19,239
on accident because that's what it

3652
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:20,771
started off as I think we have to

3653
02:44:19,239 --> 02:44:22,299
consider various incidents that occur

3654
02:44:20,771 --> 02:44:25,271
and work on putting them into

3655
02:44:22,299 --> 02:44:27,399
perspective as in what things do we as

3656
02:44:25,271 --> 02:44:28,631
regulators have control over to making

3657
02:44:27,399 --> 02:44:30,850
things more efficient

3658
02:44:28,630 --> 02:44:33,279
Koski looked to the edibles workgroup

3659
02:44:30,851 --> 02:44:35,581
that met four times in 2014 to discuss

3660
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:38,051
making edibles clearly identifiable

3661
02:44:35,581 --> 02:44:39,761
improving and simplifying the labels on

3662
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:41,739
edibles reminding consumers that a

3663
02:44:39,761 --> 02:44:43,569
single dose is 10 milligrams and to wait

3664
02:44:41,739 --> 02:44:45,489
1 to 2 hours to feel the effect before

3665
02:44:43,569 --> 02:44:47,319
ingesting more was discussed by the

3666
02:44:45,489 --> 02:44:49,331
workgroup which included state officials

3667
02:44:47,319 --> 02:44:51,040
pot shop owners representatives from

3668
02:44:49,331 --> 02:44:55,630
edibles kitchens and children's health

3669
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:57,819
advocates too much too fast the new

3670
02:44:55,630 --> 02:44:59,290
rules are due January 1st but while

3671
02:44:57,819 --> 02:45:01,091
these regulations might help curb

3672
02:44:59,290 --> 02:45:02,680
accidental ingestion it remains unclear

3673
02:45:01,091 --> 02:45:04,181
if they will stop individuals from

3674
02:45:02,681 --> 02:45:06,730
eating too much too fast

3675
02:45:04,181 --> 02:45:08,261
prominent Denver pot shop owner in Siebe

3676
02:45:06,729 --> 02:45:10,180
appointed to Goodman suicide to

3677
02:45:08,261 --> 02:45:11,979
illustrate how much tragedies can't

3678
02:45:10,181 --> 02:45:13,659
always be prevented by the state the

3679
02:45:11,979 --> 02:45:15,909
industry and the regulations they draft

3680
02:45:13,659 --> 02:45:18,159
at no point do I feel the retailer who

3681
02:45:15,909 --> 02:45:20,440
sold the cannabis is responsible for his

3682
02:45:18,159 --> 02:45:22,300
death said seek owner of Denver relief

3683
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:24,581
and chair of the National cannabis

3684
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:25,960
Industry Association I'm not a parent

3685
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:28,479
but I was disappointed because I know

3686
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:30,220
that if I have a friend or family member

3687
02:45:28,479 --> 02:45:31,060
who's rambling incoherently and not

3688
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:33,729
acting himself

3689
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:35,529
I'm not leaving that person alone so you

3690
02:45:33,729 --> 02:45:37,060
prefer to Goodman's family who said he

3691
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:38,739
was acting erratically and he didn't

3692
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:40,630
recognize our present the presents

3693
02:45:38,739 --> 02:45:42,819
almost I had never seen him like this

3694
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:44,979
but they still chose to leave him alone

3695
02:45:42,819 --> 02:45:47,290
in the condo as they went to the hot tub

3696
02:45:44,979 --> 02:45:49,001
according to reports so this dude was

3697
02:45:47,290 --> 02:45:52,331
freaking out on a cannabis edible you

3698
02:45:49,001 --> 02:45:53,591
guys and what he did was walked into the

3699
02:45:52,331 --> 02:45:56,021
room and shot himself and killed himself

3700
02:45:53,591 --> 02:45:58,060
and that's kind of what sparked a lot of

3701
02:45:56,021 --> 02:46:01,061
the re-examination of the cannabis

3702
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:02,319
edible rules so here's what I want to

3703
02:46:01,060 --> 02:46:04,300
say if you come to Colorado and you eat

3704
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:05,800
some edibles respect that [ __ ] it is

3705
02:46:04,300 --> 02:46:07,421
serious these aren't the brownies that

3706
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:08,921
your sister used to make these aren't

3707
02:46:07,421 --> 02:46:10,030
the cookies that your mom used to make

3708
02:46:08,921 --> 02:46:12,610
back in the 70s

3709
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:15,251
these are lab tested edibles made by

3710
02:46:12,610 --> 02:46:17,261
professionals this started being made

3711
02:46:15,251 --> 02:46:20,860
for medical patients that had cancer

3712
02:46:17,261 --> 02:46:22,841
Crohn's disease severe pain cachexia

3713
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:24,521
we needed a way to get these people well

3714
02:46:22,841 --> 02:46:25,870
and we weren't [ __ ] around so we

3715
02:46:24,521 --> 02:46:27,551
figured out ways to make these edibles

3716
02:46:25,870 --> 02:46:29,320
right you guys are not taking it

3717
02:46:27,550 --> 02:46:30,460

02:46:32,021 --> 02:46:35,620
and then you're gonna mess up our laws

3721
02:46:33,489 --> 02:46:36,760

3743
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:27,340
marijuana right now Monsanto is a

3744
02:47:25,750 --> 02:47:29,440
breeder what the hell are they gonna be

it says the news that has been welcomed

3749
02:47:35,170 --> 02:47:38,649
by scientists and leaders of the

3750
02:47:36,459 --> 02:47:39,970
agriculture business alike as it moved

3751
02:47:38,649 --> 02:47:41,649
forward toward the industrial use of

3752
02:47:39,970 --> 02:47:43,539
marijuana and hemp products could bring

3753
02:47:41,649 --> 02:47:45,779
a major shift towards marijuana policies

3754
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:48,790
in the USA and ultimately to the world

3755
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:51,221
under present under present US federal

3756
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:54,160
law it is illegal to bezu to possess use

3757
02:47:51,220 --> 02:47:56,709
buy sell or cultivate marijuana since

3758
02:47:54,159 --> 02:47:58,510
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970

3759
02:47:56,709 --> 02:48:00,430
classifies marijuana as a schedule 1

3760
02:47:58,510 --> 02:48:04,200
drug although it has been decriminalized

3761
02:48:00,431 --> 02:48:06,221
in some to some extent in certain states

3762
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:08,200
Monsanto's interest in the field has

3763
02:48:06,220 --> 02:48:10,569
been interpreted by experts as the

3764
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:13,090
precursor to a major shift in Marijuana

3765
02:48:10,569 --> 02:48:16,029
Policy in the u.s. that is as it is

3766
02:48:13,090 --> 02:48:17,979
believed the company would not have

3767
02:48:16,030 --> 02:48:20,110
invested so much time and energy if it

3768
02:48:17,979 --> 02:48:21,819
not had previous knowledge of the

3769
02:48:20,110 --> 02:48:23,980
federal government's openness toward the

3770
02:48:21,819 --> 02:48:26,470
future legalization of marijuana damn

3771
02:48:23,979 --> 02:48:28,750
those hard to read I'm sorry you guys

3772
02:48:26,470 --> 02:48:30,340
lawyer and marijuana law specialist

3773
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:32,140
Edmond grunt of the drug policy Alliance

3774
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:34,030
admits Monsanto's involvement in

3775
02:48:32,140 --> 02:48:37,209
marijuana projects could definitely help

3776
02:48:34,030 --> 02:48:39,190
the pro legalization activist currently

3777
02:48:37,209 --> 02:48:41,079
federal law criminalizes marijuana and

3778
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:42,909
hemp derivatives because public opinion

3779
02:48:41,079 --> 02:48:44,470
is still against it and legal commercial

3780
02:48:42,909 --> 02:48:46,360
production in the u.s. is currently

3781
02:48:44,470 --> 02:48:48,970
handled by a patchwork of small farmers

3782
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:50,380
who are not trusted by investors a major

3783
02:48:48,970 --> 02:48:52,390
player as Monsanto could bring

3784
02:48:50,379 --> 02:48:54,640
confidence within government and towards

3785
02:48:52,390 --> 02:48:56,920
investors in the market if it were to

3786
02:48:54,640 --> 02:49:00,659
own a large part of the exploitable

3787
02:48:56,920 --> 02:49:00,659
lands and commercial products

3788
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:07,271
there's presently no way to control the

3789
02:49:05,649 --> 02:49:09,940
production of marijuana and the quality

3790
02:49:07,271 --> 02:49:11,860
of the strains a GM strain produced by a

3791
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:14,110
company with the credentials and

3792
02:49:11,860 --> 02:49:16,090
prestige of Monsanto would definitely

3793
02:49:14,110 --> 02:49:18,280
lend a massive hand to pro-legalization

3794
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:20,290
activists with the certain spheres of

3795
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:22,360
government and within the business world

3796
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:24,101
he explains I'm fired up cuz I'm a

3797
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:25,989
cannabis breeder and they're talking

3798
02:49:24,101 --> 02:49:28,569
[ __ ] saying that I don't know I'm not

3799
02:49:25,989 --> 02:49:29,709
trustable but if you use Monsanto

3800
02:49:28,569 --> 02:49:31,629
because they've got credentials and

3801
02:49:29,709 --> 02:49:34,659
prestige that people are gonna trust

3802
02:49:31,629 --> 02:49:35,949
that [ __ ] it's true but that sucks just

3803
02:49:34,659 --> 02:49:44,140
because I've got dreadlocks and red eyes

3804
02:49:35,950 --> 02:49:46,870
doesn't mean I'm not trust by the

3805
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:48,549
agricultural business firm as to what

3806
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:48,851
purposes the patent strain would be used

3807
02:49:48,549 --> 02:49:50,560
for

3808
02:49:48,851 --> 02:49:52,391
although specialists believe answers

3809
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:53,920
should come this fall as rumors of a

3810
02:49:52,390 --> 02:49:56,109
controversial new bill which could

3811
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:57,790
loosen up laws around medical marijuana

3812
02:49:56,110 --> 02:50:00,370
is reportedly scheduled to pass before

3813
02:49:57,790 --> 02:50:02,230
Congress coming this fall critics fear

3814
02:50:00,370 --> 02:50:04,450
genetically modified cannabis will mix

3815
02:50:02,229 --> 02:50:08,109
with other strains and could destroy the

3816
02:50:04,450 --> 02:50:11,681
diversity of DNA a reality dismissed by

3817
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:13,540
most studies claim experts I've got my

3818
02:50:11,681 --> 02:50:17,409
own feelings about this because I'm a

3819
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:19,510
breeder and all right so I think

3820
02:50:17,409 --> 02:50:21,220
Monsanto's gonna find a strain or use a

3821
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:22,420
strain that someone they know has been

3822
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:23,920
working with and they're gonna figure

3823
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:25,780
out ways to manipulate the genetic

3824
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:27,760
makeup of that plant to tweak it to be

3825
02:50:25,780 --> 02:50:29,260
pest and mold resistant and grow the

3826
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:30,880
most desirable sets of traits a grower

3827
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,068
could want right that would be neat that

3828
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:34,049
would be ideal

3829
02:50:32,068 --> 02:50:36,449
so let's see them breed like a high CBD

3830
02:50:34,049 --> 02:50:37,619
strain to everybody could grow you know

3831
02:50:36,450 --> 02:50:40,620
what I mean wouldn't that be awesome if

3832
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:41,790
Monsanto made a high CBD low THC strain

3833
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:43,770
that you can put in your front yard and

3834
02:50:41,790 --> 02:50:46,229
grow right next to your shrubs that

3835
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:48,510
would be awesome right girl worldwide be

3836
02:50:46,228 --> 02:50:50,579
pennies a pound right but [ __ ] no

3837
02:50:48,510 --> 02:50:52,050
that's not what Monsanto does it's what

3838
02:50:50,579 --> 02:50:54,000
they could do but they're the [ __ ]

3839
02:50:52,049 --> 02:50:55,679
devil so they don't unfortunately uh I

3840
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,969
think this is what's gonna happen I

3841
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:58,559
thought about this I think it's gonna

3842
02:50:56,969 --> 02:51:00,659
lead to a commercialized strain that

3843
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:01,799
will definitely suck it's gonna be like

3844
02:51:00,659 --> 02:51:04,049
cigarettes you know what I mean back in

3845
02:51:01,799 --> 02:51:05,398
the day tobacco probably smelled and

3846
02:51:04,049 --> 02:51:07,079
taste good and now it just smells like

3847
02:51:05,398 --> 02:51:08,760
[ __ ] car exhaust cuz it's half crap

3848
02:51:07,079 --> 02:51:10,109
that's what I think they're gonna do

3849
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:13,079
with cannabis

3850
02:51:10,109 --> 02:51:15,809
it'll probably be terrible I think a big

3851
02:51:13,079 --> 02:51:17,219
part of why people choose to medicate

3852
02:51:15,809 --> 02:51:19,170
themselves with medical cannabis is

3853
02:51:17,219 --> 02:51:21,028
because we don't want GMOs and dangerous

3854
02:51:19,170 --> 02:51:22,710
[ __ ] put into our bodies as medicine

3855
02:51:21,029 --> 02:51:24,689
we've chosen to grow our own cannabis or

3856
02:51:22,709 --> 02:51:26,669
rely on a trustworthy caregiver like

3857
02:51:24,689 --> 02:51:28,979
myself to grow the medical cannabis for

3858
02:51:26,670 --> 02:51:31,290
us so we don't have to buy pills and

3859
02:51:28,978 --> 02:51:33,148
[ __ ] from a company I was only a matter

3860
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:34,890
of time before Monsanto came into the

3861
02:51:33,148 --> 02:51:36,119
cannabis game so here's my big

3862
02:51:34,889 --> 02:51:37,199
conclusion on all this I wrote down some

3863
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:39,210
notes and I'm just reading a little

3864
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:41,399
bullet points right now I see Monsanto

3865
02:51:39,209 --> 02:51:42,929
teaming up with Big Pharma someone

3866
02:51:41,398 --> 02:51:44,699
creating a medical cannabis program and

3867
02:51:42,930 --> 02:51:47,579
Monsanto having the only plants in that

3868
02:51:44,700 --> 02:51:48,479
national medical cannabis garden that's

3869
02:51:47,579 --> 02:51:53,579
how that [ __ ] works

3870
02:51:48,478 --> 02:51:54,929
ah so they'll be they'll own the patents

3871
02:51:53,579 --> 02:51:57,120
on the seed so nobody else can grow

3872
02:51:54,930 --> 02:51:58,200
those seeds without Monsanto permission

3873
02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:00,630
you'll have to buy the seeds from

3874
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:01,950
Monsanto they'll also have the monopoly

3875
02:52:00,629 --> 02:52:03,778
by being the only strains that are

3876
02:52:01,950 --> 02:52:06,060
available in these medically regulated

3877
02:52:03,779 --> 02:52:07,560
stores so that's kind of what I think

3878
02:52:06,059 --> 02:52:09,148
they'll set up a National Medical

3879
02:52:07,559 --> 02:52:10,528
Marijuana Program they'll be like oh you

3880
02:52:09,148 --> 02:52:12,898
guys want legalize weed here you go

3881
02:52:10,529 --> 02:52:14,159
nationally legalize they're gonna say

3882
02:52:12,898 --> 02:52:21,028
where's we gonna come from they'll say

3883
02:52:14,159 --> 02:52:23,579
we'll supply it and we're gonna get like

3884
02:52:21,029 --> 02:52:25,470
that Monsanto oh gee yeah that's what

3885
02:52:23,579 --> 02:52:27,870
you want right that big 12 percent THC

3886
02:52:25,469 --> 02:52:29,398
plant right it's gonna be terrible

3887
02:52:27,870 --> 02:52:32,850
that's what I predict that's what I see

3888
02:52:29,398 --> 02:52:34,139
coming it's gonna get creepy you know

3889
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:36,000
how to prevent that right you guys all

3890
02:52:34,139 --> 02:52:39,510
have to start growing start growing

3891
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:40,829
cannabis grow your own it sounds

3892
02:52:39,510 --> 02:52:42,420
expensive it seems like a lot of work

3893
02:52:40,829 --> 02:52:43,930
but to grow your own cannabis to be

3894
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:44,920
self-sufficient is not that hard

3895
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:46,659
whatever you're paying for an ounce

3896
02:52:44,920 --> 02:52:47,799
right now if you're buying it on the

3897
02:52:46,659 --> 02:52:50,738
street if you're buying it at a

3898
02:52:47,799 --> 02:52:53,590
dispensary you can get better safer

3899
02:52:50,738 --> 02:52:55,059
cheaper cannabis by growing your own I

3900
02:52:53,590 --> 02:52:57,549
know where to get some seeds you go to

3901
02:52:55,059 --> 02:53:01,000
nature's green remedies dot-com do that

3902
02:52:57,549 --> 02:53:03,549
so never support any Monsanto fat

3903
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:07,809
companies or their subsidiaries never

3904
02:53:03,549 --> 02:53:09,369
Scott's [ __ ] all that stuff is

3905
02:53:07,809 --> 02:53:11,079
available commercially is mostly

3906
02:53:09,370 --> 02:53:13,029
monsanto like all your gardening

3907
02:53:11,079 --> 02:53:15,129
products that's mostly Monsanto [ __ ]

3908
02:53:13,029 --> 02:53:17,590
Scotts Turf Builder all the Miracle Grow

3909
02:53:15,129 --> 02:53:19,179
stuff that his all Monsanto [ __ ] all of

3910
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:21,430
the bug sprays and [ __ ] you see it all

3911
02:53:19,180 --> 02:53:23,529
the your local hardware stores mostly

3912
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:26,949
Monsanto products try to avoid that [ __ ]

3913
02:53:23,529 --> 02:53:30,060
if you can also there is a march on

3914
02:53:26,949 --> 02:53:32,710
Monsanto on May 23rd across the world

3915
02:53:30,059 --> 02:53:34,209
Google that march on Monsanto be a part

3916
02:53:32,709 --> 02:53:36,909
of that if you want people go out and

3917
02:53:34,209 --> 02:53:38,379
march in the streets and talk about how

3918
02:53:36,909 --> 02:53:40,299
they do not want these genetically

3919
02:53:38,379 --> 02:53:42,129
modified products on the shelves in our

3920
02:53:40,299 --> 02:53:44,648
stores and they do not want Monsanto

3921
02:53:42,129 --> 02:53:46,000
taking over our food supply all right I

3922
02:53:44,648 --> 02:53:47,590
could rant on that for days I'll

3923
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:57,340
definitely be keeping a personal eye on

3924
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:59,020
this topic 30 minutes let's read one

3925
02:53:57,340 --> 02:54:02,978
more quick quick news article I got a

3926
02:53:59,020 --> 02:54:04,659
quickie here like this one the DEA is

3927
02:54:02,978 --> 02:54:06,698
not only seizing less cannabis they're

3928
02:54:04,659 --> 02:54:08,619
asking to increase their legal growth

3929
02:54:06,699 --> 02:54:10,840
three times for medical research this

3930
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:12,399
article comes from the leaf Lee and who

3931
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:16,029
is it written by who gets credit here

3932
02:54:12,398 --> 02:54:18,278
nobody gets credit so just the leaf Lee

3933
02:54:16,029 --> 02:54:19,510
is all or leaf Lee leaf Lee dot-com

3934
02:54:18,279 --> 02:54:21,880
it says the Drug Enforcement

3935
02:54:19,510 --> 02:54:23,199
Administration is seizing less cannabis

3936
02:54:21,879 --> 02:54:25,929
year-over-year according to its own

3937
02:54:23,199 --> 02:54:28,149
records in 2009 the agency confiscated

3938
02:54:25,930 --> 02:54:30,699
needs from and destroyed ten point four

3939
02:54:28,148 --> 02:54:33,698
million cannabis plants whereas in 2013

3940
02:54:30,699 --> 02:54:35,739
the numbers fell to 4.4 million and last

3941
02:54:33,699 --> 02:54:38,290
year the DEA seized four point three

3942
02:54:35,738 --> 02:54:39,818
million the steady decline can be

3943
02:54:38,290 --> 02:54:41,920
attributed to fewer funds being made

3944
02:54:39,818 --> 02:54:43,629
available for enforcement partly due to

3945
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:45,728
the economic recession and partly

3946
02:54:43,629 --> 02:54:47,170
because both the public and government

3947
02:54:45,728 --> 02:54:50,379
stance on cannabis has softened

3948
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:51,850
considerably over the years with more

3949
02:54:50,379 --> 02:54:54,339
states looking to legalize in the next

3950
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:55,870
few years as well as less funding being

3951
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:56,719
generated from local and state police

3952
02:54:55,870 --> 02:54:59,270
assets

3953
02:54:56,719 --> 02:55:01,369
Jers the downward trend should continue

3954
02:54:59,270 --> 02:55:03,229
meanwhile the DEA is shifting from the

3955
02:55:01,370 --> 02:55:05,420
ones doing the confiscating to the ones

3956
02:55:03,228 --> 02:55:06,679
doing the growing administration is

3957
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:08,270
proposed to increase the amount of

3958
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:10,398
cannabis it's legally allowed to produce

3959
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:12,590
by more than three hundred percent in

3960
02:55:10,398 --> 02:55:14,358
order to meet to meet the demands of

3961
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:16,760
researchers who are studying the

3962
02:55:14,359 --> 02:55:19,579
potential medical benefits the plant has

3963
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:21,680
to offer if it sounds weird that the DEA

3964
02:55:19,579 --> 02:55:23,090
is simultaneously seizing cannabis grows

3965
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:25,340
and growing their own plants for

3966
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:27,318
research purposes well it is my [ __ ]

3967
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:29,659
agree that's not only weird that's

3968
02:55:27,318 --> 02:55:31,639
hypocritical but hopefully we will

3969
02:55:29,659 --> 02:55:33,469
continue to see the DEA shift its focus

3970
02:55:31,639 --> 02:55:35,090
to regulating the legal market and

3971
02:55:33,469 --> 02:55:37,398
focusing their efforts on illegal grows

3972
02:55:35,090 --> 02:55:39,978
and activity that damages the positive

3973
02:55:37,398 --> 02:55:41,778
progress the industry is making besides

3974
02:55:39,978 --> 02:55:43,670
we do need more cannabis research to

3975
02:55:41,779 --> 02:55:45,319
help propel the industry forward so if

3976
02:55:43,670 --> 02:55:46,818
the DEA can make it happen the

3977
02:55:45,318 --> 02:55:48,799
administration is actually doing

3978
02:55:46,818 --> 02:55:52,250
something positive for the cannabis

3979
02:55:48,799 --> 02:55:53,629
community yeah that's true if they get

3980
02:55:52,250 --> 02:55:54,770
more money for more research hopefully

3981
02:55:53,629 --> 02:55:56,000
they do the right thing with the

3982
02:55:54,770 --> 02:55:57,590
research hopefully they're not trying to

3983
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,959
prove that it's making people [ __ ]

3984
02:55:57,590 --> 02:56:01,100
or making [ __ ] people turn into

3985
02:55:59,959 --> 02:56:02,719
zombies hopefully they're actually

3986
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:05,120
trying to research that it helps us

3987
02:56:02,719 --> 02:56:07,459
cancer it helps with seizures it helps

3988
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:09,620
with nausea it helps with depression it

3989
02:56:07,459 --> 02:56:11,329
really helps with PTSD it pisses me off

3990
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:14,420
that in Colorado PTSD is not a

3991
02:56:11,329 --> 02:56:15,829
qualifying condition to get your medical

3992
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:18,529
marijuana recommendation that's really

3993
02:56:15,829 --> 02:56:20,600
frustrating to me alright that's the

3994
02:56:18,529 --> 02:56:23,930
last news article I want to read to

3995
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:27,260
close up all the news here what else do

3996

4042
02:58:02,101 --> 02:58:06,120
taking care everybody like that we

4043
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:08,699
didn't have a spot to plug in the email

4044
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:12,061
on this club they didn't have any damn

4045
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:13,980
three-prong outlet spots so we got an

4046
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:16,289
extension cord that didn't work

4047
02:58:13,979 --> 02:58:17,819
we found another room we dabbed out that

4048
02:58:16,290 --> 02:58:19,021
room but then we quickly got kicked out

4049
02:58:17,819 --> 02:58:19,681
of there we weren't allowed to dab in

4050
02:58:19,021 --> 02:58:21,391
that room

4051
02:58:19,681 --> 02:58:22,710
luckily Kevin had a torch and a rig in

4052
02:58:21,390 --> 02:58:24,840
his car and it was close

4053
02:58:22,709 --> 02:58:27,479
so Kevin saved the day we got to dab out

4054
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:28,799
