00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,769

23

00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,840

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
podcast we're actually gonna talk about

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,840
some cannabis related stuff it has

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,520
become a tradition that we start the

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,390
podcast off by talking about what we're

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,399
dabbing I have got kind of a buffet of

30
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,960
cannabis concentrate English I don't

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,969
remember which ones I did and did not

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,189
dab I remember that the strawberry

33
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,689
daiquiri really stood out to me so let's

34
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,308
talk about strawberry daiquiri it was

35
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,129
really sweet I had a great flavor to it

36
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,349
all of the strawberry strains kind of

37
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,509
have a similar flavor in my mind that

38
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,899
strawberry candy but there's also like a

39
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,780
dusty sort of a thing behind it it's the

40
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,430
old half chewy strawberry candy oh the

41
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,750
ones with the other goo in the middle it

42
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,340
was hard on the outside gooey in the

43
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,780
middle and had like a strawberry look

44
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,159
like a fake strawberry wrapper on it

45
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,379
yeah that's kind of what it tastes like

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,469
dude you were accurate this label here

47
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,989
says it is 76 point one percent THC and

48
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,429
ninety point three percent total can

49
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,709
have a noise it doesn't list those other

50
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,110
cannabinoids but it claims that they are

51
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,149
there I got me fairly nicely buzzed

52
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,560
obviously I'm brambly that could be a

53
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,030
combination of all of these girls don't

54
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,350
worry it's we hit a few of them there's

55
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,819
a nice little selection do you remember

56
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:54,959
what you just took a dab of we just

57
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,309
sound like [ __ ] if we just read

58
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,739
through that list of options so I'm

59
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,500
right you can look quickly what got your

60
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,750
attention there was one of the tribes it

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,349
was either star tribe or lost tribe the

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,728
star tribe

63
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,939
cuz I asked you what do you expect to

64
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:10,739
star the last tribe the the smell was

65
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,800
too spot-on with the name it was all

66
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,450
grassy and body odor okay

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,270
and so I set that one down on the star

68
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,409
okay and grassy and body odor for some

69
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,870
people they're gonna go here I want to

70
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,250
dab that actually it's it's not a bad

71
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,780
day it's just not what I was in the mood

72
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,280
for exactly that's why I like the

73
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,140
variety I've got strawberry I've got

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,719
oranges I've got the star dog which is

75
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:31,159
that fuelie and fruity flavor there's

76
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,289
some jellybeans there's some super

77
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,939
Silver Haze it's got that uh I think

78
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:37,189
it's almost got that dryer sheet aroma

79
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:38,569
that I talked about I just said I wasn't

80
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,609
gonna list all the concentrate so we're

81
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,079
gonna stop there we're making people

82
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,670
jealous and mad at us people like come

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,760
on guys I'm out here in whatever state

84
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,959
I'm in I got a message from somebody in

85
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,639
there saying hey you talking about the

86
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,590
Colorado crunch check this out and they

87
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,299
squeezed their buds on a video like this

88
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,759
is what the dispensary here sells us and

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,340
it just exploded I was like I was like

90
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,139
man it was kind of similar to maybe some

91
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,599
bottom of the jar Colorado crunch stuff

92
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,029
real hard he told me the pricing he's

93
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,289
paying around sixty and eight and I was

94
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,560
like oh man you're paying three times

95
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:11,569
the price but it's just as crunchy a

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,840
similar crunch the herb didn't look bad

97
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,039
but it was crunchy and there's uh some

98
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,659
questionable [ __ ] everywhere

99
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,400
everywhere I loved the Colorado crunch

100
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,289
episode then when I was bud tendon all

101
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,620
those moons ago

102
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:26,599
that was a common thing people come in

103
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,550
and I like stop the place I hit last

104
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,500
time they're all the herb was drive dude

105
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,150
it's Colorado yeah we don't have water

106
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,889
here right notice how you're putting on

107
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,020
lotion all the time you're all dry and

108
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:39,949
flaky and that's yeah the weed feels it

109
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,110
also yep you really don't lose that herb

110
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,399
evita flavor like take your pick yeah

111
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,550
I'm not sure which one I would prefer

112
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,990
yeah the dry the dry because then it

113
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,540
tastes like herb I want that herb flavor

114
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,920
actually have two grinders every now and

115
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:54,709
then when you get some nice moist herb

116
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,289
like the grinder I normally use doesn't

117
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,849
handle it well so you actually switch up

118
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:01,579
grinders for two different batches of

119
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,079
herb yeah if I notice it's not if the

120
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,380
herbs got a little more moisture content

121
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,150
to it mine my daily used grinders kind

122
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,349
of chewing on it and not grinding it

123
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,950
down into the next chamber I'll switch

124
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,449
grinders

125
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,310
that's pretty [ __ ] pretty [ __ ]

126
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,349
funny then do you combine the two

127
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,589
batches and mix them together so that

128
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:21,339
you've got a little even I I prefer to

129
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,899
smoke blends at the house so I'll buy

130
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,639
six or seven different aids and then

131
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,099
pull a little nugget of each throw them

132
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,800
into the ground

133
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,070
and can just combine them back and forth

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,530
so yeah there's a lot of mixing and

135
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,509
blending for bowls there are people just

136
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,779
smashing their phones onto the table

137
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:43,560
listening to us land and I hate you guys

138
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,929
right now it's join us don't be mad

139
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,220
embrace it I be glad that we're bringing

140
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,900
you to the table and letting you

141
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,070
participate with us I know it's got to

142
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,509
be frustrating though to be somewhere

143
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,920
where you can't even have concentrates

144
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,139
it can't even have access to good flour

145
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,629
but we've got it here so do what you can

146
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,180
do in your area to legalize cannabis so

147
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,610
that you can consume have access to it

148
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,069
you said something funny a minute ago

149
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,480
I wanted this was totally not on my list

150
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,769
of stuff to talk about you know what

151
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,490
really drives me crazy is when people

152
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,259
say that this place has the best herb or

153
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,470
this state has the best herb or this

154
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,240
state has yeah bro I bet you some of the

155
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,650
best growers on the planet or just

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,180
tucked away in places we don't even know

157
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,739
about it's the places that you never get

158
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,850
to try their product you'll never know

159
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,310
who they are they're quiet they're

160
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,020
Hermits there's good herb everywhere we

161
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,939
got to quit saying that this one state

162
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,189
has the best this other has the best

163
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,680
yeah Colorado has a reputation for

164
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,120
drying crunchy herb we won but you know

165
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,920
what California's got a reputation for

166
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,269
right now a bunch of [ __ ] pesticides

167
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,790
I'd rather smoke crunchy herb over

168
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,229
pesticide herb like but we got to stop

169
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,090
the whole competition thing I don't

170
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,069
think that you can't say Callie has the

171
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,019
best have you smoked every grower in

172
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,909
Colorado's herb have you smoked every

173
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,060
girl were in Oregon's product but it's

174
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,900
it varies so much harvest the harvest

175
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,839
really grow or absolutely the herb grown

176
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,039
up in the mountains is a lot different

177
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,219
than the stuff grown down here in the

178
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,200
valley my summer and winter crops in the

179
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,550
same grow room are going to be different

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,930
just because I'm fighting different

181
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,900
environmental factors I'm gonna have

182
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,569
different VP DS based on the outside

183
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,699
environment a little bit the rooftop air

184
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,680
conditioners can't handle some [ __ ] in

185
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,420
the winter that air conditioner return

186
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,220
may bring in a little extra cold I was

187
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,449
just thinking of the fog roll and I was

188
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,250
like you never know what's gonna happen

189
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,990
and it varies batch the batch and room

190
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,240
to room and grow to grow grow her to

191
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,949
grow her harvest harvest and that room

192
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,540
has been corrected by the way as the fog

193
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,099
used to come in and air conditioner

194
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,780
returned in a facility Mike and I used

195
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,610
to be involved in it doesn't anymore but

196
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,288
that was a really funny morning can

197
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,120
in the grow room was foggy from outside

198
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:48,718
yep I mean it's gonna vary wildly but I

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,370
think there are some places where good

200
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:55,168
herb is a lot easier to find than other

201
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,668
places right man and when I've spent

202
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:58,799
time on the East Coast like I know

203
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:01,109
there's good weed there it's just not

204
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,150
obvious like it is here yeah you can't

205
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,468
I still see people smoking herb from

206
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:08,218
time to time out in the world it's just

207
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:10,379
it's really bad but there are also

208
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:13,709
there's got to be I'm sure every state

209
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:18,300
in every town probably there's got to be

210
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:20,399
yeah just cranking out some fire it may

211
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
not get anywhere it may stay in his jar

212
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,269
but or his little circle yeah where his

213
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,168
little crew yeah

214
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:29,818
let's if you look at how the cannabis

215
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:32,490
industry developed over the last thirty

216
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,028
years for most of the country it's

217
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:40,079
little home growers selling to five six

218
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:42,329
eight nine ten fifteen people and those

219
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,758
people each have six eight ten fifteen

220
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:47,430
customers and that's as far as that

221
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,110
little bubble goes and so it looks like

222
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,788
one of those little star graphs where

223
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,800
there's a little line and then a circle

224
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:55,439
and then little lines coming off that

225
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,418
circle the other little dots right bad

226
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,860
description there but you guys know what

227
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,478
I'm talking about a cluster it's a

228
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,919
grower in the middle then little spider

229
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,800
legs come off of it and then you got

230
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,658
guys to buy quarter pounds then off the

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,278
quarter pound guys you got guys that buy

232
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,500
ounces and off the ounce guys you guys

233
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:12,149
mostly probably buy eights and quarters

234
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,829
after that I think it just breaks down

235
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,838
yep and there's the new kid who wants to

236
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:17,818
start dealing who takes all the people

237
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:19,500
who want to buy grams yep he gets a

238
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,960
quarter and sells enough grams to make

239
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,149
himself a gram you know yep take a

240
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,038
quarter break it into seven grams smoke

241
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,120
one sell six have enough money to buy

242
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,649
the next quarter it's got to be

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,959
frustrating it's for so many people

244
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:34,828
started yep that's how yeah but that's

245
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,528
the system coast-to-coast and so I'm

246
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:39,478
sure there's phenomenal growers in in

247
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:41,038
parts of the south and parts of the East

248
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,560
Coast where you wouldn't think of is

249
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:47,149
herb centric but

250
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:51,529
you gotta come West people just to see

251
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:53,360
what you're missing I know some really

252
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,029
good growers down south we just can't

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,740
talk too much about them right allegedly

254
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,049
allegedly there could be some good

255
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,610
growers down south I know as I see

256
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,289
pictures all the time I was like this is

257
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,700
allegedly Mississippi but it'll expire

258
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:09,439
this is from New Orleans it'll expire I

259
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,150
see stuff in New York that's I've smoked

260
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,450
[ __ ] in New York that was amazing right

261
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:17,539
well there's I mean and it's expensive

262
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,910
as [ __ ] in New York my eyes lit up like

263
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:23,539
this is small-town New York not New York

264
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:26,209
City and it was expensive but it was

265
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,949
worth it and now people are gonna say

266
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,930
expensive because expensive is very

267
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,580
relative based on location it depends on

268
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:34,309
where you are we saw prices drop here

269
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,690
drastically it's I always laugh when

270
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,579
people say the black market is

271
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,040
flourishing and legal pod states and

272
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,350
it's like really yes well it went

273
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,319
it's heart went from 4,000 a pound to

274
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,110
1,000 a pound clearly less quickly ten

275
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,480
years very quickly in ten years doesn't

276
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,100
sound like a long time but when it goes

277
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,259
from four thousand to one thousand and

278
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,580
ten years that is a if you're if you

279
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,350
were somebody who was kind of used to

280
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,960
having that sort of income it made a

281
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,970
huge change in your life it fully used

282
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,550
to be possible to make a comfortable

283
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,529
living is a single adult male with three

284
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:09,079
or four lights four lights was perfect

285
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:12,500
if you add four bloom lights in a little

286
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:16,370
clone area with a t5 you could make a

287
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,339
comfortable living yeah not anymore

288
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,440
no now that no that's all those people

289
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,210
in Colorado have either moved to

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,530
Prohibition land or gotten into a

291
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,660
different part of the game or they're

292
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:27,769
employed in the legal cannabis industry

293
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,750
at this point because they already know

294
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,069
how to grow all right so I've got an

295
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,269
email from a listener this is the part

296
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,310

297
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,838

298

00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,700
I thought was really funny you said you

328
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,289
know what takes out more Gardens than

329
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,300
police you know it takes out more

330
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:40,740
gardens than bugs you know it takes out

331
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,708
more gardens than thieves and criminals

332
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,209
and I said what is this thing you're

333
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,278
talking about that takes out a lot of

334
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,469
Gardens so Mike well I've got you here

335
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,899
on the microphone remind everybody what

336
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,889
takes out so many Gardens angry

337
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,379
girlfriends bro

338
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,009
angry girlfriends bro without hesitation

339
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:01,649
he knew where I was headed with that yes

340
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:03,899
one of my golden rules is don't tell

341
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,759
people about your garden never tell

342
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,919
other people about your garden I'm a

343
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,509
giant hypocrite I come on social media I

344
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,159
come up here on a podcast and I talking

345
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,809
about I grow cannabis yes I live in

346
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,389
Colorado I run a commercial facility

347
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:17,099
where we've got millions of dollars in

348
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,809
licensing thousand dollars of equipment

349
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,399
we pay a bunch of taxes they know we're

350
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,319
there there's nothing to hide got a

351
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,089
commercial facility I do consulting for

352
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,070
a lot of places I'm able to do my job

353
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,899
and talk about it I don't know your

354
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,550
situation I don't know where you're

355
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,990
located I don't know who you are I don't

356
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,789
know who you associate with I don't know

357
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,740
who your local sheriff is I don't know

358
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:36,149
what's going on wherever you are if

359
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,110
you're a new grower one of my first

360
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:42,570
pieces of advice is to STFU shut the

361
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,669
[ __ ] up there's no need to talk about it

362
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,079
no need to talk about it and I know

363
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,419
again I'm a hypocrite I love to post

364
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,009
cannabis pictures I'm in Colorado if you

365
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,689
can cover yourself do it if you're

366
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,069
somewhere in an illegal state if you're

367
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,769
somewhere in a medical state and you are

368
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,879
unsure of your surroundings just don't

369
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,709
talk about it there's no need

370
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,208
don't take your best friend there don't

371
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,259
take your cousin there there's no need

372
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,719
to even take your brother there

373
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,100
especially don't take a new relationship

374
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,199
there I was gonna say girlfriend but

375
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,399
it's 2019 it could be your boyfriend it

376
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:10,259
could be your girlfriend you could be

377
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,950
dating a space alien that identifies as

378
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,370
a dolphin

379
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,600
don't take that person there the still

380
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,549
identifies a person if they're a space

381
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,540
alien slash dolphin right probably I'm

382
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:22,409
gonna call them a person just because

383
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:24,778
it's getting confusing if the reason we

384
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:27,750
phrased this rule like we do is because

385
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:30,570
when this rule was the golden rule or

386
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,240
became the golden rule growers for

387
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,000
predominantly young white males sorry

388
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,470
that's just that was not you're

389
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,929
absolutely right so was girl

390
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,028
ex-girlfriends and girlfriends ruined

391
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:45,899
the most the highest percentage of

392
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:50,189
growth more than user air more than cops

393
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,589
more than other criminals breaking up

394
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,680
its it kills more cards than [ __ ]

395
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,560
anything else more Gardens than anything

396
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,578
else all right so that brings us to this

397
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,929
email I don't know what my face just

398
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,278
diverse made a really weird noise I hope

399
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,500
nobody else heard that that brings us to

400
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,028
this even though I goes a lot like this

401
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,470
it says hey Rasta Jeff I'm writing you

402
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,750
from Prohibition land and I've made a

403
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,769
huge mistake I broke your rule about not

404
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,049
telling anyone even your girlfriend this

405
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,120
guy already done [ __ ] up we told you

406
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:20,458
so bro not to rub it in he goes on to

407
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,750
say predictably breaking up with her was

408
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,309
a gigantic mistake

409
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,389
no it wasn't this is how it turned out

410
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:32,009
no I'm glad you finally did it break

411
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:33,689
pammi ass etc but doesn't sound like a

412
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,059
mistake bro absolutely the right thing

413
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,220
to do he goes on to say she's angry and

414
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,969
already sent the law to my house I

415
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,800
turned them away yeah exactly not cool

416
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,019
bro I turned them away for lack of a

417
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,028
warrant good job smart move good good

418
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,159
move then he goes on to say I tore down

419
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:52,649
anything green but I have no idea if

420
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,480
they will be back I'll be back that's

421
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:58,198
see that's what I said he goes on to say

422
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,319
if hypothetically a grow existed it does

423
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:04,078
not anymore I am pretty bummed about the

424
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:06,809
loss allegedly but I don't know what to

425
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,059
do with my gear and my genetics I've got

426
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,888
a little over $400 worth of seeds from

427
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,169
you alone he did big shout out for the

428
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,480
IRA genetics collection he says and

429
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,948
another dollar amount from elsewhere we

430
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,680
don't need to put that number in here he

431
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:22,109
also says who knows how much money in

432
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,088
equipment I really don't know I really

433
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,720
don't want to give them up that's kind

434
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,130
of a setback

435
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,950
that might make me give up altogether

436
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:32,789
but I need to keep my nose clean until I

437
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:35,879
can find a new place Benny says what can

438
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,860
and should I do with it all I'm weary of

439
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,330
cluing anyone else in to keep my [ __ ]

440
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,220
for a few months and I'm wondering if

441
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,009
some seeds and a few boxes filled with

442
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,680
general indoor growing equipment are

443
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,299
enough to lose sleep over should I find

444
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,370
a new home for the equipment and flush

445
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,019
the genetics can I take them out of the

446
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,629
fridge and hide them somewhere else for

447
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,340
a few months if so how should I store

448
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,340
them then he says thanks bro I really

449
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,370
appreciate the advice just call me the

450
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,110
grower who ought to have known better so

451
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,200
bro thank you for the great email you

452
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,419
ought to have known better now Mike what

453
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,250
do you think is the best plan of action

454
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,919
for this guy the first thing I told him

455
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,019
was huh stay cool for a while they're

456
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,439
coming like just did coming just keep in

457
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,759
mind they'll be back they coming if they

458
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,160
wasn't gonna come they wouldn't have

459
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,799
come the first time the fact that they

460
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,569
showed up the first time means their

461
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:34,289
plate is empty enough to fill with your

462
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:36,600
ass who knows what the ex told them it

463
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,849
clearly wasn't anything too over-the-top

464
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,670
or they would have showed up the first

465
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,110
time differently the fact that they

466
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,870
showed up or told to go away and get a

467
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,830
warrant and they left tells me she's

468
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,580
probably just said plants if you cut

469
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,500
down and remove any clear evidence of

470
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:00,629
cannabis production you should be good

471
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:04,170
to go if you have all the equipment

472
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:06,809
setup and seeds in a drawer and grill

473
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:10,019
books on a shelf but no plants under the

474
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:12,328
lights you're probably still exposed to

475
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,769
some criminal penalties depending on

476
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:17,909
where in prohibition land you are he

477
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:19,500
without revealing too much i've asked

478
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,170
questions he is in a state that has

479
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,220
medical cannabis but not any provisions

480
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,220
for legal growing

481
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:31,299
honestly your best bet is to take it all

482
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,430
down and put it all somewhere else for a

483
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,409
while that's pretty much what I thought

484
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,840
you would say my advice like until you

485
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,420
move yeah my advice was to get rid of

486
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,429
anything green anything soil anything

487
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,769
root ball anything organic needs to go

488
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,920
well there's other ways to go about this

489
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:49,839
if you feel like really getting into a

490
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,539
[ __ ] you match with the cops and your

491
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,369
axe leave all the grow equipment up run

492
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,579
to Home Depot get some celery and some

493
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:59,199
tomatoes and just go hog wild when they

494
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:01,058
show up like come on let me show you the

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,190
guard and these is my organic tomatoes

496
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,779
and this is my organic celery you guys I

497
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,220
don't even have notes written down and

498
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,289
that was gonna be option number three

499
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,509
for me what's good all of the [ __ ] up

500
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,889
and go hang tomatoes or go put Tomatoes

501
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:13,390
under there and when they come be like

502
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,679
yeah man I got a bunch of you want some

503
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,230
organic Tomatoes are [ __ ] delicious

504
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:23,740
that's gonna cost you money and time and

505
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:27,910
energy if you're into homegrown produce

506
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,799
like it's a fun option but honestly I'd

507
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,860
pack everything overnight take it to my

508
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,769
mama's house absolutely my advice again

509
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:37,509
I predicted that my advice I knew my

510
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,039
advice cuz I knew that but I told him my

511
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:41,079
advice would be to get rid of anything

512
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,329
organic I told him gear isn't illegal

513
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,039
books aren't illegal I told him the

514
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,720
seeds may depending on where he is how

515
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,759
paranoid he is those seeds may he may

516
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,819
want to do something could be very very

517
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,670
illegal seeds can be intent to cultivate

518
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:57,700
in certain place I remember picking

519
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:00,460
through stashes carefully in discarding

520
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,529
seeds because people had recently been

521
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,390
busted and were charged with intent to

522
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,950
cultivate because they had like a jar

523
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,570
that they threw all their seeds in so

524
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,700
those seeds need to go somewhere as well

525
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:11,500
the equipment isn't illegal to have and

526
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,970
he bought that somewhere it's normal

527
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,440
equipment you can have that as long as

528
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,029
you don't have a cannabis plant under

529
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,759
that that's just normal a grow light

530
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:20,349
it's just a normal white so my advice

531
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,359
was to get rid of all the organic stuff

532
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:24,219
and consider getting rid of the seeds

533
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,928
now I'm adjusting my advice saying those

534
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,789
seeds should go I predicted that your

535
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,440
advice would be to get rid of all the

536
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,450
organic and to pack up all the equipment

537
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,130
so I knew that Mike would take it that

538
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,500
extra step just cuz that's how mike goes

539
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,030
my third piece of advice was going to be

540
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,619
if you really want to [ __ ] with them and

541
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,819
you want to have any excuse as to why

542
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,288
your electric bill was

543
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,788
as to why you have all of that gear

544
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:44,229
because it's depending on where you are

545
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,569
there that's what they're doing right

546
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:48,308
now is gonna pull the electric bill yeah

547
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,589
they need stuff for the warrant and his

548
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:53,558
his angry ex-girlfriend called and said

549
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:56,079
isn't usually enough right and so they

550
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,118
do through your trash or pull your

551
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,878
electric bill and a couple of neighbors

552
00:19:58,118 --> 00:20:03,308
electric bills so that they can show the

553
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:05,648
judge look you know the third house on

554
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:07,329
the block is drawing you know ten times

555
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:10,538
the power of any other house on the

556
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:12,368
street clearly something's amiss plus

557
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:14,259
the girlfriend's statements plus we

558
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:16,388
found green leafy matter in his trash

559
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,009
can right that's enough for your Warren

560
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:21,699
plus when we knocked on the door we sort

561
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:22,960
of smell the skunky aroma yeah yes so

562
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,169
yeah keep keep thinking that they are

563
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,608
gonna come back so bottom line get rid

564
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,409
of the plants get rid of organic

565
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:31,329
material get rid of precursor which

566
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:33,759
means seeds get rid of all of that stuff

567
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:36,638
the second option get rid of the

568
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,649
equipment also just get it gone quickly

569
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:40,358
be discreet about it get it out of there

570
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:41,378
keep an eye on your trash like Mike just

571
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:43,178
said they're gonna go through your trash

572
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:44,829
they're gonna watch your electric bill

573
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,720
they're gonna pay attention so if you

574
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:48,009
really want to be smooth allegedly one

575
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,239
thing that you could do and we are not

576
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,579
recommending any sort of illegal

577
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:52,929
activity put some [ __ ] tomatoes under

578
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:55,178
those plants and grow yourself some

579
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:59,249
tomatoes under those lights

580
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:01,659
yeah thanks Mike we said get rid of

581
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:03,940
there's a lot of steps and get rid of

582
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,720
they don't involve your own trash can

583
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,659
right I don't want to advise you on how

584
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,479
to destroy the evidence of a potential

585
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:17,590
crime but your trash cans gonna get gone

586
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:21,069
through that's just how it be possibly

587
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:23,259
already has and will be again like you

588
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,720
can pull up videos on YouTube where like

589
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:28,960
cops raid wrong house and it started

590
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,298
because dude left grossed or had his

591
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,090
license plate written down six months

592
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:35,739
later when the cop got a free week they

593
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:37,238
ran around and checked on some of those

594
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:40,239
license plates and just did trash

595
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:42,879
inspections and they found legit like

596
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:46,569
herbal tea for a head cold in this

597
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:48,998
dude's trash can and him and his son had

598
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:51,668
like a little veggie lab going in the

599
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:53,089
basement and they ended up with machine

600
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,590
guns pressed to their temple

601
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,209
while they were handcuffed on the floor

602
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,319
after they adopt their house got

603
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,730
flashbang and their door exploded like

604
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,539
if you already know the cops are coming

605
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,670
to your house

606
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,819
your job is a responsible human is to

607
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,360
clean that [ __ ] up Mike you're making me

608
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:11,299
paranoid

609
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,729
I [ __ ] move dude go somewhere else

610
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,919
just pack your stuff up when you can

611
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,480
move in and start fresh again when you

612
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,039
move it's just not worth your freedom

613
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,539
you don't even start fresh in the next

614
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,750
place you have to move somewhere and

615
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,670
tell until you get cleaned up until they

616
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,990
forget and then go to another place if

617
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,320
you think you're gonna start again you

618
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,000
have to skip a spot I don't know about

619
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,059
that cops have pretty full plates

620
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,619
everywhere like right now they've got a

621
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,149
name and address as soon as those two

622
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:40,399
pieces of information are in separate

623
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,640
places like if you move to a new place

624
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,810
you're you're pretty good to go I think

625
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:57,980
it was the cops I was still worried

626
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:59,599
about at the bar like you were trying

627
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,099
not to talk about how ugly my dreadlocks

628
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,169
were but then you took a shot and it

629
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:04,309
just came out as fugly as [ __ ] hair

630
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,430
over I don't know what's going on like

631
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,799
seriously think about the 15 or 20

632
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:13,940
people we've known over the years that

633
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,379
have really had a garden just vanished

634
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,309
get destroyed get them in a bunch of

635
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:22,400
trouble in almost every instance it was

636
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:26,539
a disgruntled employee or girlfriend yep

637
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,810
in in almost every instance yeah um it's

638
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:32,809
almost never the cops showed up on an

639
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:35,839
anonymous tip from a complete stranger

640
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:38,059
who happened to smell it walking by our

641
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,220
local sheriff had to do a big PR start

642
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,230
with a bunch of anti-pot locals to get

643
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,500
that [ __ ] to happen in the rest of the

644
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,759
world that don't have them very often

645
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,099
it's almost always a disgruntled

646
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,740
ex-girlfriend or a buddy you showed that

647
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:53,429
just got in some different trouble that

648
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,009
wants out

649
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,200
it's that's why you just shut up and

650
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,359
don't tell anybody about your grow in

651
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,490
prohibition land there you go it's part

652
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,069
of the reason the Colorado and

653
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,140
Washington Oregon California kids it's

654
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,970
went so nuts talking about our garden

655
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,100
and posting pics for a while because we

656
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,680
weren't allowed to for so long

657
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,240
like that's when I really understood the

658
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,480
whole point behind like the super

659
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,640
flamboyant gay pride parade like as soon

660
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,110
as I was finally allowed to beast open

661
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,670
in public about some [ __ ] that I was

662
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,558
totally not allowed to be open in public

663
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,600
before I was like oh now I get the

664
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:32,099
[ __ ] glitter overalls it makes sense

665
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:34,889
now Mike I needed that lesson in life

666
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:37,349
right I did not do I did not do the dig

667
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,990
in right made me connect in my head and

668
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,699
Janet now that big glitter bomb was just

669
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,279
[ __ ] held so tight and that big

670
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,529
glitter bomb [ __ ] exploded and came

671
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:51,329
out like it did I get it now we saw here

672
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:54,899
like we voted in 2012 to make it legal

673
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:58,139
an hour later social media exploded with

674
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:01,230
garden takes is this is legal now I

675
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,030
can't accidentally ruin my life for

676
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,640
social with a social media post of a

677
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:08,609
plant it's just a picture I took of a

678
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,360
room with plants in it like if there's

679
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:13,500
not a dead body in the picture you

680
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,689
shouldn't be able to get in a bunch of

681
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,220
trouble for it but pictures of plants

682
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,970
could get you in a fuckload of trouble

683
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,679
before and they're very true and yeah

684
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,120
like I'm still blown away how you've

685
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:29,370
opened my mind it's it it really made

686
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,019
sense to me no it makes perfect sense

687
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:33,959
and I never thought of it like that and

688
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,429
my mind needed that lesson and you see

689
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,529
social media with it like there's

690

place to another in the middle of the

746

night because they just broke up with

747

so-and-so allegedly they threatened to

748

that light right bring it one of my

752
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,909
favorite memories of legal cannabis we

753
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,308
were trimming an outdoor grow at a

754
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:50,289
friend's house and multiple police

755
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:52,058
officers came up through the back gate

756
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:53,470
area because he lived his back gate had

757
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:55,329
an alley and then it was the back gate

758
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,548
multiple law enforcement officers came

759
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:58,538
up casually walking up and they there

760
00:27:57,548 --> 00:28:00,460
was a crime that had happened in the

761
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:02,230
area I kid you guys see this person and

762
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,058
we're like I know him haven't seen him

763
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,829
and like okay and then they said you

764
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,148
guys have a lot of cannabis here and I

765
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:09,308
said I've got a medical marijuana card

766
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:11,018
and the cop slowly turned his head from

767
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:12,849
person to person just like unit yeah I

768

recreational this is all medical we got

771
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:22,720
lucky they were looking for a serious

772
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:24,668
and we were at a point where the cops

773
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,308
knew that checking our paperwork would

774
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,809
take a very long time of up their day

775
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:30,579
there were probably eight to ten of us

776
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:32,349
out there just trimming sitting on

777
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:33,970
picnic tables in the backyard the

778
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,589
warrant squad had wandered up the alley

779
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,089
and noticed that a half dozen people

780
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,308
were trimming weed in the backyard

781
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:42,308
buddy's wife was a Christmas tree she

782
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:44,349

783
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:45,908
the dogs are running around and Here

784
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,709
Come law enforcement officers just like

785
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:49,149

786
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,679
person like oh that's that's a

787
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:52,239
neighborhood guy we know who he is now

788
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,340

789
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,370

790
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:58,839
card nothing I've just went around the

791
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,518
circle and they kind of looked at you're

792
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,750
like well they've got cards have a good

793
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,399
day guys and they left us alone they

794
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,349
never came back they never bugged us but

795
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,449
that was a summer outdoor medical

796
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:09,638
harvest that was before the rules were

797
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,830
so gray that it was more of a pain in

798
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:13,089
the ass to come bust us because then

799
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,019
he'd go to court and they'd go what rule

800
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,548
did they break they have medical

801
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,528
marijuana plants they'd go we don't know

802
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:19,778
but they have replant it's got to be

803
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:21,970
illegal and there was just no clear wine

804
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:23,919
at that point so there was a lot of fun

805
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,929
when it was all gray area yeah if you're

806
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,059
in one of those gray area wild wild west

807
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,590
is what we called it get it on get it

808
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,759
while you can because it will not last

809
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:35,558
forever so first it comes the start of

810
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,408
normalization legalization regulation is

811
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:40,000
what I'm thinking of that comes then it

812
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:43,149
then it tightens up and then it tightens

813
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,009
up if you're in a state where it's just

814
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:47,528
kicking on and you get an early start

815
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,599
stocking money away for equipment change

816
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:52,138
overs and regulation changes the cost

817
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,699
you random money out of nowhere

818
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:56,319
absolutely I'm gonna remember the edible

819
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,419
companies here freaked when everything

820
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,099
had to be stamped it's every edible

821
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:03,220
company had to buy all new molds like

822
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:03,638
overnight this is a real thing be ready

823
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,389
for it

824
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:08,589
be prepared for the future be ready all

825
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,178
right Mike before we start wrapping up

826
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:11,888
the podcast I think it was a pretty good

827
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,809
show I'll keep it short and tight here

828

830
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:25,000
track so hard sometimes I was gonna ask

831
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,649
if you had any things to say before we

832
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,940
start wrapping up the podcast but I kind

833
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:31,569
of just want to turn off your mind to do

834
