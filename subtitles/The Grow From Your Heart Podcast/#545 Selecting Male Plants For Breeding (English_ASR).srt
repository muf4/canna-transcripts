00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,218
podcast off by talking about what I'm

23
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,820
smoking today I've been taking dabs of

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,620
sour best lemons live batter from our

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,030
friends at Green Dot labs this is a

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,238
blend of SBS

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,060
E and lemon tree Northern Lights I'm not

28
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,868
sure what SBS e means but it smells

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,820
[ __ ] amazing

30
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:12,769
on the package the flavor is described

31
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,000
as lemons lemons and more lemons

32
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:17,099
sometimes the descriptions are spot-on

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,590
sometimes they're questionable this time

34
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,780
it's [ __ ] lemons times lemons Plus

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,750
lemons squared that is accurate

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,549
sour best lemons just opening a package

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,879
and holding it a few inches from my face

38
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,979
I'm getting lemon candy lemon pledge and

39
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,599
in a stringent lemon punch there's

40
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:35,759
something real citrusy and kind of sharp

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,000
getting to my nose I'm putting it a

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,188
little closer it's got a gross delicious

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,188
lemon aroma and flavor to it it is

44
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,929
abundant and ridiculously lemon I can't

45
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,819
say lemon Terps enough when it comes to

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,009
this concentrate it is delicious when I

47
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,209
take dabs of this it makes my brain spin

48
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,828
around in my head for a minute there's

49
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,618
something about the lemon turf in this

50
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,599
it just makes my brain spin and then the

51
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,578
remaining buzz after that is tremendous

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,669
it keeps me nice and talkative on the

53
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:06,599
back of the package it says it contains

54
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,068
64.6 1% total THC and zero CBD I really

55
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,139
dig this one it is going to be a great

56
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,359
concentrate podcast because it has got

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,039
me stoned and rambley and that always

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,930
makes for a good

59
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,729
alright ladies and gentlemen in this

60
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,860
episode I am going to talk about a thing

61
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,780
I get asked quite a bit in the last

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,700
episode we talked about feminized seeds

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,280
so in this episode I'm going to talk

64
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,439
about male selection selecting a male

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,628
plant for breeding many of the things I

66
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,568
say when it comes to male plant

67
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:35,098
selection also applies to reversing a

68
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:36,899
female plant I'll touch on that a little

69
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,149
bit when it comes to the conversation

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,459

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,810
make it very easy for you to support the

104
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,180
show while we were talking about patreon

105
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,209
I should make a short announcement a

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,400
disclaimer patreon is changing many

107
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,769
things on their service one of the

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,989
things they have changed is taxes I

109
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,389
don't understand completely how the

110
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,098
taxes are going to work on patreon it is

111
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,870
a really long thing that I need to read

112
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:21,029
through and understand before I agree to

113
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,408
anything but it is something that is

114
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,149
going to happen I'm not going to stop

115
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,129
being on patreon I have to pay them

116
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,750
taxes they've got to pay taxes when

117
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:29,699
money moves Uncle Sam wants a

118
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,230
somebody wants a piece of that pie every

119
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,180
time a pie gets cooked somebody wants a

120
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,590
bite so there will be some things

121
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,560
happening on patreon

122
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:40,079
you need to read on your contributor and

123
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,850
and I will read on my creator and and we

124
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,349
will read together and be clear of

125
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,030
what's happening on patreon so that

126
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,340
there are no surprises at the beginning

127
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,079
of the month they are making adjustments

128
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,959
while they were making adjustments I

129
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,019
adjusted some of the tiers and benefits

130
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,899
to patreon honestly I was getting a lot

131
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,370
of 420 contributors and people when I

132
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,799
say you contribute 420 they are

133
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,899
expecting a shout-out on the show I had

134
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,490
to raise that tier I moved everything up

135
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,779
one tier because I could not keep up

136
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,819
with the shoutouts I feel like I'm

137
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,279
falling behind so I did increase the

138
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,168
tiers everything moved up by one I will

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,819
continue the shoutouts until I am caught

140
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:16,918
up and then I will change all of that

141
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,418
next month I'll get caught up you'll get

142
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,490
what you paid for but in the future some

143
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,279
of the tiers will increase in price I do

144
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,050
apologize for that it's fair to the

145
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,759
audience because I couldn't keep up with

146
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,110
all of the patreon shoutouts I was going

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,339
to fall behind if people were going to

148
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,470
give me money to say their name on the

149
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,819
show it was gonna be 8 episodes before I

150
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,010
can give you a shout out that doesn't

151
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,569
feel fair to me so I've just simply

152
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,668
increased that cost that will

153
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,259
automatically slow down the amount of

154
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:42,149
shoutouts I have to give maybe

155
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,829
maybe people will pay extra which in

156
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,019
turn that will mean I have to do more

157
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,939
episodes so either way it's gonna work

158
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,039
out for us you guys I don't want anybody

159
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,050
to feel short-changed since patreon

160
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,700
added taxes and I adjusted some things

161
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,050
on patreon I felt that it was my

162
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,490
responsibility to come and be

163
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,770
straightforward about it

164
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,329
I edited some [ __ ] go take a look there

165

168
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,579
appreciate it you guys that's how I'm

169
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,569
able to keep the show afloat that's how

170
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,250
I'm able to make sure that if this

171
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,959
equipment goes weird I've had to replace

172
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,759
a few pieces of my equipment the

173
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,469
headphone amplifiers they go out quite a

174
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,659
bit I try to make sure to have brand new

175
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,950
microphone covers if anybody it's Co vid

176
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,280
times right now so I don't have guests

177
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,959
here on the show but ah the patreon pays

178
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,969
for the zoom account the website account

179
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,199
my internet connection that is the sort

180
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,580
of stuff we're covering with patreon

181
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,589
plus these little fuzzy microphone

182
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,269
covers so that I'm not spinning into the

183
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,189
same one week after week so that if Mike

184
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,870
comes over Jesse comes over they're not

185
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,490
spinning into the same one anybody you

186
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,740
have on the show gets a freshie I don't

187
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,550
like to recycle those I've had a couple

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,199
of pieces of equipment

189
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,960
take a [ __ ] on me we've replaced that

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,420
with patreon contributions this computer

191
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,129
the old MacBook started making funny

192
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,720
noises and I couldn't render video on

193
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,519
that thing anymore I cleaned it out I

194
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,560
refurbished it as many times as I could

195
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,299
handle it was frustrating it was making

196
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,240
the show not as fun and easy to produce

197
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,009
so I used patreon contributions to

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,810
upgrade I've got a fresh computer this

199
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,089
was about a year maybe two years ago but

200
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,560
I've got a good firing up computer that

201
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,839
works very well we're on zoom right now

202
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,850
I'm recording via zoom it's way easy for

203
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,169
me to record and edit using zoom that's

204
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,000
the Tech Talk you don't care about but

205
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,590
that's really easy using the new

206
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,300
computer so the patreon contributions

207
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:21,149
are what keep the show moving smoothly

208
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,000
also sometimes you may help me out

209
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,949
getting the extra for a gram jar so that

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,779
I can get nicely baked and produce a

211
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,000
really good podcast I think I do a good

212
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,439
job on a nice and stone some people and

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,699
they don't work super well when you get

214
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,750
them high I've had some people that I've

215
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,279
worked with them and I've taken him to

216
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,720
lunch and allegedly given them a couple

217
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,009
of dabs and I've had to take them back

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
to work and set them and a chair and

219
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,069
tell them sit there and no [ __ ] moved

220
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,450
you're gonna break something it might be

221
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,980
you or it might be some equipment but

222
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,289
don't touch anything something will get

223
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,150
hurt today some people like myself and

224
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,530
like white Mike and like most of the

225
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,120
crew that hangs out we take a couple of

226
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,529
dabs and we are able to function so I

227
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,300
think keeping me stocked up with good

228
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,369
dads and good equipment will keep this

229
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,949
podcast going boy that turned into a

230
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,810
long [ __ ] ramble about patreon ah

231

237
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,480
scale over one for most of the lower

238
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,919

promising and not fall far behind that's

245
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,970
part of why I'm doing that all right

246
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,500

247

248
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,480
selection Oh before we get there um I

249
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,890

252

254
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,669
couple of wonderful submissions and

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,290
contributions I've gotten so many that

256
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,089

257
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:52,649

258

attention there's one guy that sent me

260
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,240

261
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:59,519
I kind of like your style bro but keep

262

can use outros I can use mid show stuff

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,380
I could be playing music right now if I

265
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,879
had a cool little just something subtle

266
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,039

we are um I like to share with you guys

304
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:16,289
what is happening in my grow if you've

305
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,929
been following along you know that

306
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:21,179
recently I acquired some Jack the Ripper

307
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:23,399
seeds you know that I found a beautiful

308
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,229
Jack the Ripper male within that pack of

309
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,209
seeds then you also know I found a

310
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,269
couple of select Jack the Ripper females

311
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,950
they are in a room they are successfully

312
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,179
pollinated the pistols have curled up

313
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,610
the pistols are brown

314
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,559
it looks like seeds are developing there

315
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,769
are a few others select females in that

316
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,679
room um there's a golden goat I think

317
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,360
I've revealed that there is of course I

318
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,939
put on a rise and there I've got to

319
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,590
pollinate the arise with the Jack the

320
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,840
Ripper what would I be doing if I didn't

321
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,610
take one of Subs best maker made

322
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,750
creations one of his best breeders and

323
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,669
put that's one of my most known

324
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,019
creations that was kind of the idea of

325
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:00,689
the project across those two together

326
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,429
that was the initial idea then of course

327
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,500
I loaded the room up with a few others I

328
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,699
think I've revealed a couple on other

329
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,529
episodes excuse me I'm trying not to

330
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,940
burp into the microphone here I feel

331
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,889
like I've revealed a couple of the

332
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,300
other strains I in other episodes

333
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,069
there's a golden goat there's an arise

334
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,599
what else should we talk about today I'm

335
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,510
going to post a photo of it so there is

336
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,550
a blueberry cookies female that has been

337
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,409
pollinated by Jack the Ripper that will

338
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,719
be very promising both of those strains

339
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,610
of a very beautiful shape a very

340
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,980
beautiful structure create aromas

341
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,659
tremendous buzz this should be a winner

342
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,730
are there a couple other things in there

343
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:36,209
maybe I'll trickle out more names more

344
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,590
ideas as the show goes by also I've said

345
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,330
this before everyone's gonna ask me for

346
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,800
testers chill out bro they're they're

347
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,600
just being made the seeds are just

348
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,639
forming within the calyxes I can see the

349
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
calyx is swelling up with seeds just

350
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,710
getting going so be patient I've said

351
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,990
that before

352
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,090
I need several weeks several several

353
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,399
weeks they've got probably four to five

354
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,360
more weeks to go chop them down harvest

355
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,399
we've been over this I'm not gonna

356
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
repeat all that but be patient testers

357
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,889
will be coming what I do like is

358
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,930
excitement and eagerness for names what

359
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,569
do we call Jack the Ripper two blueberry

360
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,279
cookies what do we call Jack the Ripper

361
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,570
two golden goat if you've got name ideas

362
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,740
I would love to see them you can send

363
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,390
them to me um

364
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,789
a great way to do it would be to just

365
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,139
send them to me on an email at grow from

366
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,480
your heart at hotmail.com

367
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,980
or leave them in the comments on the

368
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,289
YouTube video I would love to see

369
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,779
comments of strain names in the YouTube

370
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:27,059
video so it would be a blueberry cookies

371
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,939
female pollinated by a Jack the Ripper

372
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,519
male a golden goat female pollinated by

373
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,630
a Jack the Ripper male um and that's as

374
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,309
far as we'll go we'll just go for those

375
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,200
two now if you got name ideas throw them

376
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:39,569
in the comments in a future episode I

377
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,710
will talk about how I choose stray names

378
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,930
because I'm sure you've noticed I've

379
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,610
been a little bit of a theme a schema an

380
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,839
idea around my strain names they aren't

381
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,940
all consistent but you can see where my

382
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,470
mind is where my brain is and if you

383
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,960
can't I'll talk more about that in the

384
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,879
future all right now so in my breeding

385
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,550
ten I've got that going on I think now

386
00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:00,029
it is time to talk about selecting male

387
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:01,649
plants for breeding cannabis I think the

388
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,740
most important part about selecting

389
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,970
plants for breeding is having a goal

390
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,259
sure maybe you grew some seeds and you

391
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,970
ended up with the male and a female and

392
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,980
he thought I'll breed that's fun that

393
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,779
will work you're gonna have success

394
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,700
you're going to make seeds the question

395
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,379
is are those seeds worth a [ __ ] if

396
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,730
you're just a hobby grower if you're

397
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,200
looking to supply yourself with some

398
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,700
seeds to play with that's a beautiful

399
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,860
project have fun doing that there's

400
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,200
nothing wrong with that

401
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,940
if you want to be a little more serious

402
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,890
about it if you're somebody like myself

403
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,300
who is putting seeds out for a market my

404
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,100
seeds are available at seeds here

405
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,899
now.com they're available at several

406
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,759
other vendors so I need to make sure

407
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,949
that my seeds are reliable that they

408
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,689
have a reliable outcome that they have a

409
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,670
good germination rate I need to have a

410
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,230
goal in mind when I'm making seeds

411
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:45,269
otherwise you're just pollen chucking

412
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,710
which is fine if that's your goal if you

413
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,000
want to [ __ ] around it we're not all

414
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,650
setting out to be professionals at

415
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
everything we do some people just want

416
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,009
to have a little fun making some seeds

417
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,450
growing seeds doing it over again your

418
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,759
self sustainable that way it's a

419
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,500
beautiful project but if you really want

420
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,970
to walk down and get into the breeding

421
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,370
game if you really want to get serious

422
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,050
about breeding there are a few major

423
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,970
steps you need to take first of all I

424
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:07,229
really recommend I didn't write this

425
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,279
down this is off the top of my head

426
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,129
something I thought I should include

427
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,980
read some books there is a lot of

428
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:15,960
knowledge just hidden in pages of books

429
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,029
and it's mostly free you can get a lot

430
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,700
of books available in PDF form on the

431
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:24,029
internet now if you type in breeding

432
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,220
books by Greg Greene or Mel Frank or

433
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,659
Robert Connell Clarke any of those books

434
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,790
will be filled with enough knowledge to

435
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:33,000
blow your mind and make you a decent

436
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:34,919
breeder decent a well-educated person

437
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,450
who could have a good idea of breeding a

438
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,250
lot of those books give you a lot of

439
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,710
wonderful ideas but you have to do this

440
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,850
[ __ ] to actually understand it then once

441
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,460
you've read some books about breeding

442
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,470
read about a lleol charts and Mendel

443
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,540
charts understand what Gregor Mendel had

444
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,639
in mind understand what his goal was

445
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,740
understand what he was doing that will

446
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,539
really give you more intuition on

447
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,789
breeding so read some books about

448
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:59,490
breeding read about Mendel charts read

449
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,919
understand aliens understand chromosomes

450
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,460
understand the basic biology of plants

451
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,599
that will really give you a head start

452
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,120
then once you understand all of that

453
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,379
stuff and it comes time to breed forget

454
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,450
all of that [ __ ] and go with your

455
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,590
intuition and take two plants that you

456
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,690
know are going to make a positive

457
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,160
outcome I know that sounds like a lot of

458
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,070
silly steps cuz I just told you learn a

459
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,959
bunch of [ __ ] then forget it I am a

460
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,370
musician I'm a trained musician this is

461
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,740
a side rant that will make what I'm

462
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,840
saying relevant I understand how to read

463
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,639
and write music I can read a chart and

464
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,899
play it while I'm reading it I can turn

465
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,100
the page with one hand and keep the

466
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,199
groove going and keep playing I'm not

467
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,970
bragging about my musical skill I'm

468
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,629
saying I'm so comfortable at reading a

469
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,730
chart

470
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:40,529
that I can play it very well when it

471
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,120
comes concert time we don't take the

472
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,500
charts we don't take the music that's

473
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,240
embarrassing you got to remember the

474
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,710
songs on stage you don't see any of

475
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,149
whatever your favorite band is they

476
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,280
don't have music on stage that are

477
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,199
rocking so I learned the music

478
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,149
I studied the music I've got a very deep

479
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,310
understanding of what each note means in

480
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,319
that song it's so engrained in my heart

481
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,759
that when I get on stage it's intuitive

482
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,710
and I don't make the wrong decisions

483
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,899
because I've got the proper training for

484
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,700
my instincts and my education take over

485
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,110
and the music comes out honestly

486
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,670
sometimes I [ __ ] up on stage but that's

487
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,409
the beauty of music sometimes you can

488
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,969
fall on your face and nobody gets hurt

489
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,409
you hope to catch the one when it comes

490
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,930
back around and you keep [ __ ] going

491
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:17,459
so now I compare that to breeding read

492
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,979
all your books get a solid education

493
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,389
have a solid foundation and then get out

494
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,550
there and freestyle when the time comes

495
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,929
and it should come out beautifully grow

496
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,579
from your heart breed from your heart

497
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,899
things will come out successfully but

498
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,879
have some sort of education and

499
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,319
understanding what you're doing so with

500
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,659
all of that being said we need to have a

501
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,930
goal when we are breeding what is your

502
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,939
goal and the goal and the traits you

503
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,159
were seeking have a lot to do with the

504
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,870
male plant you select for your breeding

505
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:47,459
project your male plant is going to

506
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,690
contribute at least 50% of his stuff to

507
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,269
your breeding project so if you're

508
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,010
making a cake the male is 50% of your

509
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,079
ingredients you got to have good [ __ ] to

510
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,870
start with or this cake will never taste

511
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,450
good so let's talk about some good

512
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,009
traits that we want to find in a male

513
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,680
plant the only way to find these traits

514
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,500
is to grow the male plants you've got to

515
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,730
get some seeds ah get a population of

516
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,039
seeds I don't know how many seeds you've

517
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,559
got I recommend a lot if you can grow a

518
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,449
lot grow a lot a minimum of 10 if you're

519
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,279
looking for a male a lot more if you've

520
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,439
got the space the time and the legal

521
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,660
means to do so so grow a bunch of seeds

522
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,089
then we're gonna select a male out of

523
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,360
that population of seeds how are we

524
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:29,819
going to select a male right away I

525
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,740
don't want so if we take 10 plants we

526
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,329
pop 10 seeds let's just say 10 it's easy

527
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,039
to get your hands on a 10 pack of seeds

528
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,629
a 12 pack a lot of breeders offer that

529
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,210
at a fair price so you've got a 10 pack

530
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,220
of seeds we grow them out most likely

531
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,930
we're gonna find at a 10 we're going to

532
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,640
find somewhere between four and six

533
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,259
males we're gonna remove the females

534
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,790
from the room that's another grow that's

535
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,740
another episode that's another strategy

536
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,849
do whatever you want with that party or

537
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,980
brain right now I'm gonna play with the

538
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:56,069
males in this grow room I've got four to

539
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,380
six males the first one that shows me

540
00:17:56,069 --> 00:18:00,569
it's a male is probably not going to be

541
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,490
a breeding male the one that is the

542
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:04,619
tallest and the stretchy ax stand the

543
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,808
proudest to get up there is probably not

544
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:08,549
going to be my breeding male sometimes

545
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:10,139
they're the same plant sometimes those

546
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,879
are the first two males that I get rid

547
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,940
of and I'll tell you why they don't

548
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,840
qualify a minute ago I said I want my

549
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,058
male to be 50% of my breeding mix those

550
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,799
big boys they get too big right away

551
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:26,369
those guys that start to pollinate

552
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,649
immediately in my opinion they dominate

553
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:30,569
the recipe too much and they don't show

554
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,570
enough of the female that I use in my

555
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:36,149
crosses when I do breeding so let's say

556
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:38,009
we took this male and I put it on a

557
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,960
strawberry fields plant we're gonna say

558
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,129
that I took a chocolate plant I'm just

559
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,509
picking two things that are different

560
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,790
chocolate and strawberry when I breed

561
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:47,069
those my goal is chocolate strawberry

562
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,170
right I mean as a hypothetically as a

563
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:51,599
breeder I'm partly cheffing this I want

564
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,120
chocolate strawberry if my male plant is

565
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,980
too dominant in his genes if he's too

566
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,019
[ __ ] or if we got a big caveman

567
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,569
that's at the gym all the time that guy

568
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,730
is going to over dominate my mix and I'm

569
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,230
gonna make more chocolate I'm not gonna

570
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,569
get enough strawberry out of there it's

571
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,980
gonna look like this guy and maybe if

572
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:10,169
that's what you were looking for as a

573
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,360
breeder maybe that's a success but

574
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,730
that's not what I started out for so I

575
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,289
want to find a male did flowers a little

576
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,058
bit later I want to find a male that

577
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,730
doesn't show me flower right away and

578
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,410
doesn't get real tall immediately the

579
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,179
reason the males are getting super tall

580
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,250
is so they can get up above the canopy

581
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,720
and drop pollen down on all of the

582
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,250
females and they can be the dominant

583
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,850
male that wins the group and there are

584
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,579
generations get to continue so I don't

585
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:37,558
choose the first or second male it will

586
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,689
show me flower now we had somewhere

587
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,359
between four and six now we're down to

588
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,279
about four or two maybe three males left

589
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,250
to play with I'm going to watch these

590
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,960
guys grow I don't want any weirdo plants

591
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,119
if I've got a weirdo plant that's doing

592
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,009
in veg doing weird shapes weird

593
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,199
structures that's not going to set

594
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:57,029
myself up for success in future breeding

595
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,429
I don't want more weirdo [ __ ]

596
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,019
he's got to go just think about it like

597
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,149
people if you see people out there

598
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,259
unfortunately if you see some weirdo

599
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,579
can people walking around scratching

600
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,259
their head yelling at the [ __ ]

601
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,368
telephone pole you don't want to breed

602
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,929
with them if you see people that look

603
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:11,488
like they got their [ __ ] together their

604
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,019
body is in line they're healthy or

605
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,608
[ __ ] smiling they got a good

606
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,829
presentation you want to breed with them

607
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,878
right plants should be the same way if

608
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:19,408
you're looking at a plant going I don't

609
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,638
know things kind of [ __ ] up you don't

610
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,469
want to breed with that why do you want

611
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,878
to continue that gene we're looking to

612
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,950
make more tents we don't want to make a

613
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:28,648
bunch of [ __ ] sixes there are six is

614
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,229
out there your goal is to take maybe a

615
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:33,689
six and a seven and make them into a ten

616
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:35,548
or make two eights into an eleven you

617
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,139
got to improve when you're breeding so I

618
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,940
don't want weirdos I don't want mutants

619
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:41,069
I don't want problematic plants we'll

620
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,989
talk about problems in in a moment but I

621
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:44,848
want something a male plant that isn't

622
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:47,579
the tallest not the first to flower and

623
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:49,528
doesn't show me any weird growth if he's

624
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,658
got problems from the beginning if he

625
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:53,729
was a struggler I may not use that one

626
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:56,759
I don't need struggles in my offspring

627
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:59,700
so before we get too far make sure or I

628
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,919
recommend to take a male or take a clone

629
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,019
of your male plants before we go into

630
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,149
flower I found a really great male I

631
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,618
call him King Solomon I've also got a

632
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,998
Jack the Ripper male that I'm playing

633
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:10,678
with he doesn't have a name I just call

634
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:12,479
it Jack the Ripper male I have got

635
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,639
clones of them so that when I make

636
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,649
successful crosses with these I can use

637
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:18,388
them again and again and again because

638
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:20,098
I'll keep cloning and having a father

639
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:22,048
plant same as a mother plant but it's a

640
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:23,460
dude I'll have that plan around for

641
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,259
continued production so I can keep

642
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,999
producing pollen from him and keep

643
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,460
making more successful crosses so I

644
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:32,489
recommend that you get a clone of your

645
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,348
favorite male now here are things to

646
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:37,858
look for traits that we want to seek in

647
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:40,108
our male the shape and the structure do

648
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,759
you want squat and bushy plants do you

649
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:43,710
want tall and skinny plants do you want

650
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,179
plants that make one main cola because

651
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,219
that is an option if you're running a

652
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,419
whole bunch of plants on a table and you

653
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,219
just want to turn them in burn them you

654
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,229
can put 64 plants on a four by four

655
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,849
table they grow up to make one main

656
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,979
stock you flip them real early

657
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:58,468
you get sixty for ten grand buds it's

658
00:21:55,979 --> 00:22:00,899
640 grams from one light not bad at all

659
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:04,139
in my opinion you can breed plants to do

660
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:05,908
that do you want tall plants do you want

661
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:07,528
skinny plants do you want bushy plants

662
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,599
do you want big wide leaves do you want

663
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:11,249
little skinny leaves you can breed that

664
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:12,450
into your plants it's all about the

665
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:15,778
selection that you make with your

666
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,009
parents you want branchy and sturdy

667
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:18,720
plants do you want brand

668
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,000
in sturdy plants I want branchy plants

669
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,089
with lots of good structure close

670
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,339
internodal spacing nice beefy branches

671
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:28,079
that will hold up big buds I want male

672
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,119
plants that are going to make big fat

673
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,309
male clusters that will translate to big

674
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,099
female buds when it comes down to the

675
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:38,039
progeny in the future so something I

676
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,869
don't like is a hollow plant if I've got

677
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,490
a male plant and I top it and that

678
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,750
sinner is hollow you can feel them when

679
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,339
you're working with them I can look at

680
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,250
them and see them from across the room I

681
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,750
do not select a hollow male plant that

682
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,059
is just something I don't like I prefer

683
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,250
it to not be the Super Hollow plant so

684
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,740
all about the structure and the leaf

685
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,140
shape do you want short squatty plants

686
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,420
do you want big branchy plants some

687
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,500
people I like those taller longer branch

688
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,850
to your plants I get a lot more

689
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,349
production out of them I work in

690
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,969
commercial groves where we trellis I'm

691
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,369
gonna work them around I can manipulate

692
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,680
those plants to give me a lot of flowers

693
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,899
so it's all about what you want find a

694
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,730
male that represents the structure you

695
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,400
would like to recreate because that male

696
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,319
is going to give at least 50% of its

697
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,950
structure to the offspring so keep that

698
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,000
in mind

699
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:27,029
also think about odors aromas what does

700
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,890
it smell like it's only going to be half

701
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:30,569
of the mix and keep in mind think about

702
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,920
when you grow plants and veg you rub the

703
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:33,599
stem it smells kind of weird but when

704
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,970
you dry and cure it it doesn't smell

705
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,099
like that but there is consistency in

706
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,690
the way those aromas change if it smells

707
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,329
like puke when you're rubbing the stem

708
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,650
it's gonna have gassy skunky aromas for

709
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,929
the end of flower if it smells like

710
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,759
sweet feet and berries it's gonna smell

711
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,110
like fruit and blueberries and [ __ ]

712
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,460
toward the end of flower these are just

713
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:53,699
things that you'll experience as you go

714
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,430
along I like to rub the stems I like a

715
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,950
male personally that smell smells a

716
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:01,680
little bit like puke I know it sounds

717
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,660
horrible but they make great breeders I

718
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,730
like a male plant that when I rub the

719
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,470
stem early in veg or late and veg it

720
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,140
smells a little bit like the bar trash

721
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:13,019
can that fermented funky disgustingness

722
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,170
always translates into a good breeding

723
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,329
male in my opinion also a little bit of

724
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,580
sweetness a little bit of CAM and a

725
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:22,139
little bit of skunk I love that male

726
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,629
plant for breeding it's going to make

727
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,240
wonderful [ __ ] offspring but that is

728
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,160
my goal maybe you want something that is

729
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,839
the complete opposite maybe you want

730
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,920
something that smells like peaches

731
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,509
maybe you want something that smells

732
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,640
like watermelons I don't know what

733
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:38,009
you're into find the one that works for

734
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,480
you that is a big part of breeding a lot

735
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,039
of breeding is science I talked about

736
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,720
read all the books learn all the charts

737
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,129
do all that [ __ ] then I said forget it

738
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,410
all because that is where it comes to an

739
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,180
art form also we are making a lot of

740
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,490
decisions they have to be educated but

741
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,539
they also have to be artful with a goal

742
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,579
there are a lot of things to keep in

743
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,519
mind you guys so we're talking about

744
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:59,339
aromas let's talk about colors I really

745
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,319
like a colorful male plant if your male

746
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,299
plant is making purple he's probably

747
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,669
going to make purple offspring if that

748
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,200
male plant is making reds and golds and

749
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,759
oranges and you've got to let them

750
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,769
flower a little while a lot of people

751
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,470
cut down the male plants way too early

752
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,759
let them go seven eight nine weeks see

753
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,589
what you've got there because that's

754
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,480
when you're gonna see the true traits of

755
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:20,819
that male plant you'll see colors that

756
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,500
you never ever imagined would be

757
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,539
produced by that male plant when he cut

758
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,829
it down at week five and six you know

759
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,450
when you start flushing your females

760
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,919
they start turning gold they get the

761
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,090
yellow on the outside of the leave they

762
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,320
get the red and the orange down the

763
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,299
center of the leaves they start making

764
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,189
beautiful purples and [ __ ] your male

765
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,750
plants will do that and if you don't

766
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,940
give them the opportunity to grow that

767
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,509
long you'll never ever know it so look

768
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,090
for colors reds pinks purples different

769
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:46,769
shades of greens what do you like some

770
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:49,619
of those different colors will translate

771
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:52,650
in the offspring you may get 25% of your

772
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:55,199
offspring may show that color maybe 50%

773
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,300
maybe up to 75% of your offspring will

774
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,890
have that color depending on the traits

775
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:01,079
of the female depending it out dominant

776
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,060
and recessive that trait is so look for

777
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,490
colors off you've got something that

778
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,079
puts off some Purple's it is very very

779
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,700
good to breed with that plant in my

780
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,889
opinion if purple is what you're going

781
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,380
for here is something you should really

782
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,300
look for if one of your male plants is

783
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,740
putting off trichomes that's a bad

784
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,779
[ __ ] you should use him in

785
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,970
breeding the male plant is putting off

786
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,559
tracks that's kind of it's not rare but

787
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,210
it's not super common you'll find that

788
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,980
in about three out of ten keepers

789
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,840
they'll put off trichomes if you've got

790
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,059
a boy that's putting off resin the

791
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,279
female that he pollinates will put off

792
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,079
resin the seeds I mean the seeds that

793
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,789
come from that they will put off resin

794
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,500
if you got a good resin producing female

795
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:39,599
and a good resin producing male you put

796
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,309
those together guess what double resin

797
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,199
you just made a double resin oreo right

798
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,609
there so if you've got a trichome to

799
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,340
male use that guy

800
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:49,469
because it is going to work very well in

801
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,178
my opinion something else we should

802
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,079
think about when it comes to selecting a

803
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,330
male plant is flowering time how long

804
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,158
let's also talk about veg time how did

805
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:01,470
the plant grow in veg did it explode

806
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,149
with growth was it slow and shitty and

807
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,250
lanky was it problematic that he give

808
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:07,288
you any issues did it need support too

809
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,750
early or the stalks nice and robust but

810
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:14,548
we should think about flowering time and

811
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:16,950
veg vegetables did this plant keep up

812
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:19,109
did it was at smaller was it bigger was

813
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,909
it average think about that then when he

814
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:22,949
put it into flower how did it react how

815
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:24,419
long did it take to show you that it was

816
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,460
a male did it try to show you that it

817
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,720
was a male way before you flowered it it

818
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,798
had become rootbound and started putting

819
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,259
off male flowers

820
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,179
I would not breed with that so think

821
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:35,429
about flowering time how long from the

822
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,889
time you induced flower to the time you

823
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,809
started seeing male parts then how long

824
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:43,138
until those male parts started opening

825
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:44,970
up then how long until peak pollination

826
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:47,129
time pay attention to that stuff because

827
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,649
that is going to correlate and relate to

828
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,909
the flowering time of your offspring

829
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:53,278
that's why I like to let the males go

830
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,649
for quite a while 7 8 maybe 9 or 10

831
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,970
weeks if that male plant keeps growing

832
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:59,219
and stays nice and healthy and keeps

833
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,048
getting huge towards 8 or 9 weeks your

834
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,240
offspring could take eight or nine maybe

835
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:05,460
ten or eleven weeks so pay attention to

836
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,109
that male plant grow it out I know a lot

837
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,360
of breeders and a lot of growers do not

838
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:11,369
grow out male plants far enough to see

839
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,678
what they've got to work with so please

840
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:16,918
do that try it you may be amazed at what

841
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,288
you see how long does it keep spinning

842
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,730
out pollen as a breeder it's got to spit

843
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:22,259
out if you're gonna breed commercially

844
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,579
and put the seeds out it's got to spit

845
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:26,638
out enough pollen to make it worth your

846
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,829
time that's why feminized seeds are so

847
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,509
damn expensive when you reverse a plant

848
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:32,460
you've got to be very careful about how

849
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,859
you do it and you don't get near as much

850
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,960
pollen as you do from a well selected

851
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:38,638
male plant so that's a big difference

852
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,380
there make sure you're getting enough

853
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:41,908
pollen how long does it continue to spit

854
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,000
out pollen and do you get enough pollen

855
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,679
to make it worth your breeding time

856
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,079
let's talk about issues things that

857
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,909
would make me not select a male plant I

858
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,798
mentioned before a hollow plant I don't

859
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:55,889
like a hollow a male plant I don't like

860
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,168
a slow shitty grower if it takes a long

861
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:59,998
time to veg if it's got issues if it

862
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,710
doesn't handle some abuse I'm not gonna

863
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:04,288
breed with it if it's weak and spindly

864
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,629
it cannot hang out also I mentioned

865
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:08,819
earlier if it's too robust if it's too

866
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:10,558
dominant if we got [ __ ] Hulk Hogan or

867
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,028
The Ultimate Warrior in there I may not

868
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,349
choose that one for breeding so I'm just

869
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:15,118
gonna make a bunch more Ultimate

870
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:16,858
Warrior's bunch more Hulk Hogan's a

871
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:18,599
bunch more testosterone ridden [ __ ]

872
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:21,778
super beasts that's not what I'm looking

873
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,628
for also does this male plant respond

874
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:26,759
well to feeding and pH issues I kind of

875
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:28,980
abused my pill mail plants a lot like I

876
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,798
do the females feed them poorly see how

877
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,769
they react [ __ ] up the pH see how they

878
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:37,349
react see if they get p.m. see if they

879
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:39,118
are attracted to pests some plants the

880
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:40,528
bugs just love to come around as soon as

881
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:42,509
you start growing some plants the spider

882
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,069
mites go what's that new smell Larry

883
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,108
this thing smells good let's go invade

884
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:48,388
and they all go get it so see if it

885
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:50,999
brings bugs something I mentioned

886
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:53,308
earlier does it auto flower does

887
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:55,200
anything cause this male plant to go

888
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:57,690
into flower before you have flipped the

889
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,429
lights to 1212 if it got a little bit

890
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,840
rootbound and decided to Auto flower

891
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,840
don't breed with it

892
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,749
if it got a little bit um underfed and

893
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,858
it decided to go flower on you get rid

894
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:09,778
of it don't breed with it if it's

895
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:11,668
autoflowering on you that is going to

896
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:13,980
continue over into the progeny and your

897
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,419
customers will not be happy like I said

898
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,278
earlier if you're breeding for yourself

899
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,889
you can do whatever you want as long as

900
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,388
you were aware of what could happen you

901
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:23,128
were making your own creations you're

902
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:24,269
not gonna share them with anybody but if

903
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:26,398
you're putting them out to market they

904
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,720
need to be reliable they need to be more

905
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,548
consistent let's make sure I'm still

906
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,319
recording because my computer just did

907
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:32,368
some weird [ __ ] not even gonna edit this

908
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,618
out yeah we're still going we're cool

909
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:36,058
all right I just got a notification I've

910
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:37,709
got my notifications turned off so that

911
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,480
was whack but you didn't hear it we'll

912
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,769
keep moving I apologize for the

913
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,480
distraction where are we

914
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,819
auto flower you don't want one that auto

915
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,399
flowers another thing to think about is

916
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,710
were there problematic plants within

917
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,599
that seed stock did you grow out females

918
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,950
and find problems in the females because

919
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,658
it's most likely that you grew a

920
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,759
population of girls you were looking for

921
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,429
that keeper what you see in those girls

922
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,378
was there a hermaphrodite were there

923
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:03,119
intersex traits amongst the female

924
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:06,388
population which you found from the same

925
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:08,249
seed pack if so that gives me a little

926
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:10,168
suspect a little question a little

927
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:11,940
apprehension to breed with that plant

928
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,590
that tells me there is an

929
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,110
sex treats within the seed line

930
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:18,269
somewhere in that DNA it is possible I

931
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:19,798
don't know that I want to pass that it

932
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:22,138
could be a recessive trait it could be a

933
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,359
dominant trait it may pop up in the next

934
00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:26,099
generation it may pop up two generations

935
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,469
from now it may not pop up at all I

936
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,089
don't know that I would set myself up

937
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,850
with that time bomb that's kind of a

938
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:35,038
problem waiting to happen so were there

939
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:37,199
problems in the rest of the seed stock

940
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,970
did you have any trouble or they're

941
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,069
hermaphrodites where they're freaks

942
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,450
where they're mutants in the other seed

943
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:44,250
stock that's just something to keep in

944
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,808
mind is a breeder that's something I

945
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,089
like to think about I also really like

946
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:50,668
to know the parents of my breeding stock

947
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:52,678
like I know what made King Solomon I

948
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:54,450
made King Solomon and I know what made

949
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,309
the parents that made those parents so I

950
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,080
know far down the line I know the

951
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:59,398
grandparents of my breeding stock I know

952
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,308
the great-grandparents of some of my

953
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,719
wines that are out so I just really like

954
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:06,778
to know what's going on then I there are

955
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,100
many surprises then I have less I've got

956
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:09,480
the more data you have the less

957
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:13,230
surprises you're going to have is what I

958
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,579
think I'm trying to say so um where are

959
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,710
we now in my list Herms

960
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:20,369
pollen II the next step to do I think is

961
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:22,319
to select qualifying females um briefly

962
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:24,178
females that are not hermaphroditic

963
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,099
females that are not problematic females

964
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,019
that are resistant to pests and problems

965
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:30,209
and pathogens and molds and mildews and

966
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,460
issues plants that can take a beating

967
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,590
plants that you've got a goal for

968
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,840
breeding them to UM maybe you just want

969
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:38,398
to make some new seeds but if you notice

970
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,888
in my breeding I am using things that

971
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,569
are very dominant in flavors and then

972
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:45,119
I'm using a male that is very dominant

973
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:46,678
in potency so I put my potent male on

974
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,989
flavorful Oh terrific

975
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,809
oder river as females and I get potent

976
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,019
and tur P plants out of that so select

977
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:56,638
quality females then pollinate earlier I

978
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:59,069
mentioned that a lot of this talk would

979
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,439
work on a reversed plant as well if

980
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:04,019
you've got a female that fits this

981
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,028
criteria that grows well has a good

982
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,308
structure doesn't hermaphrodite smells

983
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,898
great branches sturdy has the node

984
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:11,788
spacing in the shape and leaf structure

985
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:14,369
you're looking for you can reverse that

986
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:16,638
that is a very good candidate for making

987
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:19,168
a candidate for making feminized seeds

988
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,658
make sure it's not a hermaphrodite beat

989
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:23,429
it up abuse it stress it light stress it

990
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,350
in the last episode I talked about how I

991
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,890
stress test my femme seeds my female

992
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,379
plants we

993
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,940
or I make femme seeds do that see if it

994
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,040
homes if it doesn't give you any issues

995
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,950
that plant will work very well as a

996
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,599
pollen donor plant to be reversed so

997
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,730
we've got our male or we've got our

998
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,619
reversal our next step is to get the

999
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,150
plants to the right stage and pollinate

1000
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,389
the females are going to need to be

1001
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,250
around day 18 23 25 depending on the

1002
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:50,310
cultivar I've got one plant that wants

1003
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,690
pollen like 27 day 30 sometimes so it's

1004
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,129
all about the female when her pistols

1005
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,080
are nice and ripe when she's ovulating

1006
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,550
and wants to get pollinated the male

1007
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,759
plant depends on the male plant you've

1008
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,649
selected probably around day 14 17 21 up

1009
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:05,430
to day 32 wish you're gonna be getting

1010
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:08,190
pollen pollinate um keep documentation

1011
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:10,950
of palling pollination times write down

1012
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,740
when the pollen starts I flipped on day

1013
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,408
one on day seven I saw male sacks on day

1014
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:19,139
12 pollen was coming out write that down

1015
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,909
then write down peak pollination time

1016
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,398
when did this plant really start dumping

1017
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:25,980
pollen then also if you can keep it

1018
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,019
around long enough document when the

1019
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,869
plant stopped dumping pall and that's

1020
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:33,809
also important to know your window how

1021
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:36,148
long do I get to make pollen so document

1022
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:37,980
that then also document the day you

1023
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:39,869
pollinate your plants so that you know

1024
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,460
how long you've got to grow these plants

1025
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:44,519
and how long those seeds take to develop

1026
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,800
the more data the more success you will

1027
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,509
have in the future you can set patterns

1028
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,039
and you can set expectations and you can

1029
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,840
make corrections based on your data

1030
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,300
write down a lot of [ __ ]

1031
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,940
so get your females at their peak point

1032
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,950
for pollination pollinate them um it's

1033
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,360
very easy if you don't do much the male

1034
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,980
will pollinate the room on his own if

1035
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,960
you've got a fan in there every night

1036
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,940
his [ __ ] flower is open up in pollen

1037
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,130
II because this little dust the pollen

1038
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,720
fly out everywhere if you haven't

1039
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,760
pollinated everything already turn off

1040
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,589
the fans take that male to the center of

1041
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,840
the room and just shake him and it's

1042
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,309
[ __ ] it'll be ridiculous if you've

1043
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,360
got a nice male there will be a lot of

1044
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,619
pollen and there you're gonna have to

1045
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,030
clean yourself up you're gonna get green

1046
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,409
boogers from all the pollen you'll

1047
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,080
sneeze for a couple of days it's well

1048
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:26,730
worth it so we have pollinated continue

1049
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,190
to feed the seeds of feed the plants as

1050
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,590
normal I don't give them big bloom

1051
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,210
boosters I reduce the bloom boosters I'm

1052
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:35,430
not trying to make big fat buds I

1053
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,010
increase my Cal mag a little bit I

1054
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:39,279
continue with nitrogen and I do add a

1055
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,350
little bit of amino

1056
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,660
assets when I'm making seeds amino acids

1057
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:45,039
are really good for starting life and

1058
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:46,839
getting those seeds nice and healthy I

1059
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,759
also make sure to just take really good

1060
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,200
care of the plants overall their overall

1061
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,810
health is really important make sure

1062
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,819
their pH stand fed and watered and D

1063
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:57,159
foliated and [ __ ] love for properly

1064
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,450
and you'll have happy seeds I do a few

1065
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:59,949
other tricks that I've talked about in

1066
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:01,539
other episodes but we're not gonna delve

1067
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,059
too far into that we're gonna keep

1068
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:05,440
talking about selecting a male so now

1069
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,509
the seeds are ready for harvest right

1070
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,090
time goes on we've got seeds we chop em

1071
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:13,210
to cut them the next important thing to

1072
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,010
do is to grow these seeds we don't know

1073
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,579
if this male plant we have selected is

1074
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,490
worth the [ __ ] until we grow these seeds

1075
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:23,710
and I'm gonna branch off some people are

1076
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:26,439
going to want to try multiple male

1077
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,780
plants to the same female plant for

1078
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,579
breeding I don't like that idea I

1079
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,280
honestly don't see a way that you're

1080
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:35,559
going to stop pollen from male plant a

1081
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,450
and male plant B and male plant C from

1082
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,920
cross contaminating your female plants

1083
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:40,989
so when you grow the offspring you never

1084
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,360
know which male plant was the champion

1085
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:44,829
you just wonder who - baby daddy and you

1086
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,539
don't know which male plant to breed

1087
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,519
with again and it's kind of a waste of

1088
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:50,500
time in my opinion pick one male plant

1089
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,050
breed with him at a time that is my

1090
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,929
advice in my opinion I think I've been

1091
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,490
successful and so my words may may have

1092
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:58,989
some way that may show I've been

1093
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:01,299
successful with that advice you guys

1094
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:02,739
it's all I'm saying but run this run the

1095
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,080
seeds that you've grown you've got a

1096
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:07,000
batch of seeds from either one female or

1097
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,389
multiple females run them see what

1098
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,369
you've got

1099
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:11,859
check the germination rate how many

1100
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:13,659
seeds if you can germinate ten of them

1101
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,730
how many pops when you put them in your

1102
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:17,079
germination method did you get nine out

1103
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,820
of ten you get eight out of ten or are

1104
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,009
you champion all ten germinated check

1105
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,010
that out German germination rate is very

1106
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,440
important then grow them watch them grow

1107
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,310
but they look like [ __ ] mutant plants

1108
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,349
that they look like they're gonna have

1109
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,900
struggles the entire time do they look

1110
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:34,779
like good plants flower them do they

1111
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,030
make good buds are the plants that you

1112
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,680
just created better than both of the

1113
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,540
parents that you started with because if

1114
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,519
not there's no point in continuing this

1115
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,710
line unless it is doing something

1116
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:47,800
magical for you and you smoke it if you

1117
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,389
feel perfect keep it but the goal is to

1118
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,740
improve upon the two lines that we

1119
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,769
started with so you've got to grow them

1120
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,629
out look

1121
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,849
hermaphrodites look for intersex traits

1122
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,500
look for problems are there mutants is

1123
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:59,869
it worth the [ __ ] does it take to long

1124
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,760
to flower are they very inconsistent are

1125
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:04,130
they very uniform you can have positive

1126
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,280
and negative things to document at this

1127
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:10,010
time but we've got to be sure that we

1128
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,900
have improved on the quality of the line

1129
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,040
of cannabis that is our main goal here

1130
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,930
as a breeder if you haven't made it

1131
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,940
better there's no point in breeding so

1132
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:18,769
you either need to excuse me you either

1133
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,450
need to f2 these seeds to make them

1134
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:22,579
better or abandon the project altogether

1135
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,289
if you're giving them out let your

1136
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:25,699
friends know hey these aren't the best

1137
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:27,320
seeds that I've ever made but they are

1138
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:29,329
free so you can have them you can give

1139
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,890
them away you can share them but set the

1140
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,750
expectation when you give them away

1141
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:34,819
don't say these are [ __ ] amazing

1142
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,590
seeds go hey these are they're okay

1143
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,039
they're good I mean be honest with

1144
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,380
yourself

1145
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,000
I have made some okay seeds you don't

1146
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,340
see them at any of the vendors because

1147
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,840
they are okay I only put out the champs

1148
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,160
and if they don't show to be champs

1149
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,329
after I put them out for a while if I

1150
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,489
don't see a lot of great success

1151
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:50,960
I will discontinue them for sales and I

1152
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:52,939
will give them away as freebies I'll

1153
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,199
pass them out to my friends if you stop

1154
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,940
by the booth when I'm out somewhere in

1155
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,319
public and you say hey what's up maybe

1156
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,210
I'll just pass you a pack of them for

1157
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,670
freebies but I don't sell them I don't

1158
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,619
make a profit off of the bees or the

1159
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,599
nines I put out tens in eleven you guys

1160
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:08,349
and that should be your goal as well as

1161
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,349
a cannabis breeder

1162
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:13,788
if you're listening on audio I apologize

1163
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,588
I just took a long drink I was getting

1164
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:17,119
real dry if you're watching the video

1165
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:20,358
big up thank you for sticking with me

1166
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,338
all right so the main important part is

1167
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,960
have a goal have something in mind do

1168
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:24,858
you want to make indica dominant plants

1169
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,420
do you want to make sativa dominant

1170
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:28,009
plants are you aiming for a certain

1171
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,420
cannabinoid are you aiming for a certain

1172
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,880
terpene are you aiming for a certain

1173
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,430
growth structure what is your goal have

1174
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,048
a goal in mind when you're crossing

1175
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:38,179
select a male it will fit your criteria

1176
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:40,250
for your goal I understand we don't all

1177
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,929
have unlimited seeds find something that

1178
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,059
works the best out of the pack of seeds

1179
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:46,009
you've got pay attention for dominant

1180
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:47,990
traits or positive traits pay attention

1181
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,000
for negative traits decide if that's the

1182
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:51,828
plant you want to breed with do the work

1183
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,088
breed with it Chuck bat [ __ ]

1184
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,278
pollen let those plants have their

1185
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,929
action then you've got to grow the seeds

1186
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:59,179
that is where the real test of your work

1187
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:00,739
comes in see if your progeny if your

1188
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,449
offspring if your children are worth a

1189
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:04,509
[ __ ] or if you just need to get rid of

1190
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:07,308
that mail and start all over again

1191
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,380
that's not a bad decision that is a very

1192
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:10,579
respectable and reputable decision if it

1193
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,710
doesn't work it doesn't work

1194
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:14,240
get rid of it don't do that some things

1195
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,490
just won't work that is the way the

1196
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,889
numbers work sometimes you get amazing

1197
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,659
crosses sometimes you get a whole bunch

1198
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:23,298
of [ __ ] so it's all up to you it's

1199
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,710
all about your goal ah try your best to

1200
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:26,989
reach your goal and if you don't reach

1201
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,759
your goal don't be afraid try try again

1202
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,899
like I said before when we're growing me

1203
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,460
when we're growing plants when we're

1204
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,380
playing music if we crash and [ __ ] up

1205
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,880
the best part is you don't get hurt it

1206
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,278
may cost time and money but you get to

1207
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,088
get up and try it again alright I think

1208
