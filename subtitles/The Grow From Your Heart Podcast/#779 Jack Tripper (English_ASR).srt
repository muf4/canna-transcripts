00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,618
at the top of the show so let's jump

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,899
right into talking about my strain Jack

49
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,578
Tripper a lot of people are going to ask

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,259
right away did you name this strain

51
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,438
after the character from Three's Company

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,420
and the answer is yes I absolutely did

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,459
when I was a little kid I grew up with

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,439
my mom watching Three's Company I will

55
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,818
always remember that song Come and knock

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,379
on our door and now it's going to be

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,479
stuck in your head too you are welcome

58
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,180
but that is totally where I got the name

59
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,979
Jack Tripper it is a Jack the Ripper

60
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,900
cross it had to have Jack something in

61
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,479
there it gets me so high that I feel

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,879
like I'm in a psychedelic Vortex Jack

63
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,219
Tripper Jack the Ripper it was freaking

64
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,899
perfect so let's talk more about Jack

65
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,120
dripper I really like this strain

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,120
because it tastes like a refreshing

67
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,219
lemon terp with some chemicals and crazy

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Funk to it and I really do enjoy that

69
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,000
it's got its own unique lemon candy

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,098
we're going to talk a lot about that

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,318
lemon flavor but I really love this

72
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,359
psychedelic Buzz that I get from it I

73
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,859
talk about like when you take a dab or a

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
fat bong rip of it and that's something

75
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,040
we should talk about too the flavors and

76
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,659
Aromas are totally different and the

77
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,759
concentrates than in the flowers in this

78
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,919
product but when you hit it the buzz is

79
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,439
the same I feel like it unzips the top

80
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,419
of my head and just butterflies and

81
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,219
rainbows and psychedelic colors and

82
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,259
Spirals and musical notes and all kinds

83
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,000
of [ __ ] just flies out of my head crazy

84
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,399
ideas go into my head

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,239
this is like psychedelic really

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,319
thought-provoking brain spinning almost

87
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,900
panic-inducing weed for some people and

88
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,579
I really really do enjoy that it's kind

89
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,680
of like a Time Warp I can smoke a little

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,120
bit of Jack dripper and I'll think it's

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
been five minutes but the next thing I

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,840
know it's been all day and I haven't

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,400
done [ __ ] except scrolling my phone and

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,560
mess around in the house and not get

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,900
anything done so I really like that kind

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,340
of buzz it's super intense for me

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,780
um it just makes me it's got some

98
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,459
blinders to it and I feel like I'm just

99
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,378
in my own freaking psychedelic world

100
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,259
with it so let's talk a little bit about

101
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,840
the parents of Jack Tripper what makes

102
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:45,780
up a Jack Tripper plan this was made

103
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,658
with a lemon skunk female My Lemon Skunk

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,680
female is from Greenhouse Seed Company

105
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:52,620
I'm not sure how much I've talked about

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,480
this Lemon Skunk plant the seed I grew

107
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,840
it from seed the seed was a gift to me

108
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,759
from a person in probably 2008 I think I

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,239
was gifted these seeds I think it was at

110
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:05,878
my birthday 2008 or Christmas 2008 right

111
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,280
around there is when I got the seeds it

112
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,259
was is the pack of greenhouse Greenhouse

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,818
Seed Company seeds that come in the disk

114
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,919
and I say they look like birth control

115
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,359
pills because it's a circle and there's

116
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,858
multiple seeds in there and they're all

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,319
different colors and they are all color

118
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,759
coded to what strain they are there was

119
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,978
a strawberry Haze in there or a

120
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,259
strawberry yeah strawberry Haze Lemon

121
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,519
Skunk there was an Amnesia haze there

122
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,020
are a few different things in this six

123
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,120
pack or five pack of seeds from

124
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,639
Greenhouse seed company and I had this

125
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,160
one seed of Lemon Skunk to grow and it

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,418
was amazing I loved it from all the way

127
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,680
from the beginning of the grill I could

128
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,120
tell that this plant was going to be

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,639
special it grew more quickly than

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
everybody else I'd had a great Aroma it

131
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,680
looked really appealing so that is a

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,120
lemon skunk from Greenhouse Seed Company

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,879

Aromas that we'll carry through that is

139
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,758

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,019
Ripper cross I was given permission from

146
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,939
Miss Jill to work with the Jack the

147
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,918
Ripper and I made a lot of great things

148
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,560
I wanted to definitely pollinate My

149
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,299
Lemon Skunk with it because I knew um

150
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
did I get to the goal yet yeah the goal

151
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,360
is the next part

152
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,000
um I knew that I wanted to make that

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
lemon lime dryer sheet terp sort of a

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,660
thing and I knew that the buzz would be

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,939
[ __ ] tremendous I was looking for

156
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,580
that limonene terpenolene terp and

157
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,620
possibly hoping that the thcv would

158
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,939
carry from the Jack the Ripper some of

159
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,800
the phenotypes will achieve that

160
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,899
although I don't lab test a lot of my

161
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,939
stuff I've got to let other companies do

162
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,918
that other Growers uh because here in

163
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,779
Colorado personal growth Camp lab test

164
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,939
but I made it because I was looking for

165
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,099
the lemons uh the limes and the dryer

166
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,560
sheet terpen I absolutely achieved that

167
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,960
we'll talk about that a lot I was hoping

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,538
for that extreme head Buzz that crazy

169
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,038
crazy head Buzz that comes with it and I

170
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:06,599
got that both of the strains the Jack

171
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,339
the Ripper and the Lemon Skunk have a

172
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,560
good head Buzz this gave me a really

173
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,698
nice head Buzz with some blinders

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,899
um it's like when you put the blinders

175
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,639
on a horse and they can't see what's

176
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,739
beside them that's how I feel after I

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,199
smoke this stuff it's also got a nice

178
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,360
euphoric Buzz to it some creativity some

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
psychedelic feelings to it a little

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,800
floatiness to it if you smoke enough I

181
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,138
do enjoy that and that lemon dryer sheet

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,280
flavor is just you can't stop that all

183
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,139
right

184
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,099
um more of the flavors I wrote down

185
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,019
funky skunk lemonade lemon lime candy

186
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,819
limeade lemon cleaner and dryer sheets

187
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,978
are the specific flavors and Aromas that

188
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,720
I wrote down for this podcast now let's

189
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,659
talk about the buzz I keep talking about

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,580
this psychedelia it goes straight to

191
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,319
your head when I smoke Jack trip or if

192
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,478
it's a dab if it's a bong rip if it's a

193
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,620
joint I feel it goes into my lungs like

194
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,000
work

195
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,978
however you're going to do it maybe it's

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,600
a puffco if you just sit there and suck

197
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,639
on it but either way when it gets into

198
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,560
my lungs I feel like go I'm in here I'm

199
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,720
in here and then it goes and it spreads

200
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,519
out across my chest but then it goes

201
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,860
straight up into my brain and my eyes go

202
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,939
they get all heavy and red and then I

203
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,199
start feeling my heartbeat start going

204
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,579
until suddenly it feels like my heart's

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,439
going

206
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,359
in the best of ways I like a good

207
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,978
panicky weed it might be a little bit

208
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,199
for some people it might be too much for

209
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:25,139
some people I like a good panicky weed

210
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,720
if I walk into Walmart or Target or

211
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,918
anywhere and I go oh this is great I'm

212
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,139
not high enough I got to walk into

213
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,060
Target and go I'm too [ __ ] high to be

214
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,978
in here I need an adult that's when I

215
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,620
know that I did it right so I like that

216
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,418
good panicky weed

217
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,038
all right where were we I had to pause

218
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,719
for a technical difficulty I have

219
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,060
regrouped and I think I'm back on track

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
if I do remember correctly I was talking

221
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,538
about the buzz that I did achieve from

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,280
this strain I noticed it goes straight

223
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,379
to my head sometimes it gives me the

224
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,719
wobbly eyes if you've ever been on the

225
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,519
school bus or on the bus as a kid or

226
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,099
maybe even as an adult maybe in the car

227
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,680
uh one time I leaned my head on the

228
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,899
window of the school bus and the tire

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,160
vibration coming up through the car made

230
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,739
it vibrate real good and it made my

231
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,020
vision go up and down like I was on a

232
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,418
dirt road sometimes the Jack Tripper

233
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,639
will give you the the vibrate the the

234
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,620
dirt road bumpy Vision uh it's nothing

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,180
to be worried about I kind of enjoy it I

236
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,879
like it when [ __ ] happens when I smoke

237
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,199
because I smoke so much that I gotta get

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
some sort of effect like something

239
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,160
different and unique to really uh to

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,978
really notice it I also I wrote down

241
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,439
that I get intense deep introspective

242
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,240
thoughts it's a very long lasting buzz

243
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,000
and it definitely has what I call no

244
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,278
ceiling I call it no limit weed a lot of

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,500
things that I smoke I can smoke so far

246
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,059
and get myself so lit and that's as far

247
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,278
as I'm gonna go it's got a peak it's got

248
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,500
a maximum I maxed out I've reached my

249
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,958
saturation point there is something with

250
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,759
the Jack Tripper that there is no end I

251
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,919
can just keep smoking and I can put

252
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,500
myself in a full-on fierce state of

253
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,179
being too stoned too high too panicky if

254
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,820
that's what I choose to do I can achieve

255
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,979
that with Jack Tripper so that is the

256
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,080
buzz that is the consumption we've got

257
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,759
the flavors the Aromas all right so

258
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
let's talk about actually growing these

259
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,720
plants a lot of people are going to grow

260
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,180
these plants let's talk about some of

261
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,180
the different phenotypical variation and

262
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,338
phenotypes which we may see the obvious

263
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,199
distinctions between these phenotypes

264
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm going to call them the Lemon Skunk

265
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,100
phenotypes and the Jack the Ripper

266
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,200
phenotypes you're going to see some Jack

267
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,580
the Ripper really close phenotypes

268
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,019
you're going to see some lemon skunk

269
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,639
phenotypes and you're going to see some

270
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,139
perfect right in the middles that's

271
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,080
basically how it appears when you start

272
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,299
breeding and making f1s you see the mom

273
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,100
the dad and everything in between and

274
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,958
then also you may see some wear weirdos

275
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,540
in there some of those weirdos that pop

276
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,278
up are very longer flowering phenotypes

277
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,679
that do get tall and skinny they're

278
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,299
easily identifiable early in flower if

279
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,399
you don't want to super long flowering

280
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,439
phenotype you will notice those are the

281
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,120
plants to call the tall super skinny

282
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,820
ones if they're not boys they're going

283
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,339
to take a real long time so obviously

284
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,440
there's the Lemon Skunk phenotype and

285
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,720
the Jack the Ripper phenotype the Jack

286
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
the Ripper the flowers from the Jack the

287
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,459
Ripper phenotype are more dense it's a

288
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,080
tighter more compact bud structure more

289
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,299
of a pine cone shaped like a long

290
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,320
elongated extended stretched out pine

291
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:18,419
cone those are more lime Aromas The

292
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,278
Lemon Skunk is less dense maybe a little

293
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:23,219
bit more I'm not going to say fluffy

294
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,679
just not as tight and as dense and rock

295
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,940
hard as the Jack the Ripper phenotype if

296
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,039
you've got a phenotype that's a little

297
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,380
fluffier a little looser a little more

298
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,958
Airy that is going to be Lemon Skunk

299
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,480
leaning those will also have more of the

300
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,000
lemon candy Aromas and flavors now this

301
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,220
lemon candy flavor isn't like lemon

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,799
peels it's not like straight up sour

303
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,200
lemons it's more like if you had a box

304
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,479
or a bag of or a jar even of Country

305
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,399
Time Lemonade powder and you just opened

306
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,039
it and got a good smell out of it that

307
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,958
soft lemon candy lemon sorbet sort of

308
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,219
Aroma that's what comes from this lemon

309
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,379
skunk and that's what you're going to

310
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,540
get in the cross the Jack Tripper puts

311
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,720
out a lot of that Aroma those are the

312
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:05,458
Lemon Skunk dominant phenotypes the

313
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,800
lemon skunk has the Lemon Skunk

314
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,078
phenotypes have more node spacing you'll

315
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,819
notice some of the phenotypes they go up

316
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,139
and they curve to the right and then

317
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,760
they'll make a node there then they'll

318
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,919
curve to the left and make a node there

319
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,200
it's kind of a jagged left and right

320
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,179
alternating pattern that is from The

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,980
Lemon Skunk you'll notice if the plant

322
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,239
goes straight up and spits branches out

323
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,220
of the middle left and right left and

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,959
right alternating that is the Jack the

325
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,540
Ripper the more classic plant look that

326
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,578
you're used to the limits grows up and

327
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,958
it like moves out of its way it curves

328
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,639
to the right and then it'll shoot

329
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,259
another shoot out of where it curved

330
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,000
from and then it'll go up and curve back

331
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,799
left and and make another shoe where it

332
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
curved from and it just goes straight up

333
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,039
doing that continuously those will

334
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,480
Branch out those will catch up and

335
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,000
Branch out but it does Branch a little

336
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,560
differently than a lot of plants the

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,059
Jack the Ripper phenotypes tend to

338
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,518
Branch out more like a Christmas tree

339
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,199
more like that classic ganja plant that

340
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,700
you're used to seeing that sativa Leaf

341
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
sativa plant that you always see

342
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,660
pictures of that is going to be the Jack

343
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,819
the Ripper type phenotype the more

344
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,980
Christmas tree structure tighter node

345
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,660
spacing not as elongated spaces between

346
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,759
the nodes you'll definitely notice that

347
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,620
if you've got long spacing between your

348
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,240
inner nodes that is definitely coming

349
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,039
from the Lemon Skunk you're going to get

350
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
that Lemon Skunk trait

351
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,240
um the jack the jack the ripperfino is

352
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,220
probably more ideal for commercial grows

353
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,500
just because it's it's basically easier

354
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,200
to grow and those buds are a little bit

355
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,879
more more commercial friendly more

356
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
appealing more bag appeal is what I'm

357
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,659
trying to say

358
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,059
um The Lemon Skunk Fino is connoisseur

359
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,500
weed that is great herb but it's not as

360
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,939
appealing for a dispensary herb because

361
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,278
it's not as dense as a lot of the

362
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,019
dispensaries would like it to be once it

363
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,879
gets thrown in the jar the bag and

364
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,860
treated like commercial weed and abused

365
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,778
it kind of the buds don't hold as well

366
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,940
so you might want the Jack the Ripper

367
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,679
phenotype better for your dispensary for

368
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,420
your commercial grow if you're making

369
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,979
concentrates you want that fluffy

370
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:58,559
phenotype all day the phenotype I like

371
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,420
it's kind of a 50 50 mix that leans so I

372
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,000
guess it can't be 50 50 if it leans one

373
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,919
way I'm going to say it's like 60 40 The

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,899
Lemon Skunk it's got the Lemon Skunk

375
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,179
flavor The Lemon Skunk kind of structure

376
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,700
with the Jack the Ripper limes and

377
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,559
potency to it uh there's just I can I

378
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,820
can spot both of them I can taste it I

379
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,039
can see it because I've worked with both

380
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,379
of these plants so much but it's got a

381
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,139
thicker stalk and it kind of does the

382
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,419
left right uh the shimmy the the shuck

383
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,039
and Jive the Axle Rose if you want going

384
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,799
left and right this plant kind of does

385
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,778
that but it makes long side branching

386
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,578
and it branches out really well so it's

387
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,439
got the left right but then it spits out

388
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,479
a lot of Menorah type branches it does

389
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,820
get one giant major top we'll talk about

390
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,459
that in a moment here the main stock

391
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,500
gets super thick and then it almost does

392
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,299
I want to say almost it looks like it's

393
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,620
webbing so most cannabis plants when

394
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,019
they go up and they shoot off another

395
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,578
Branch it just looks like that branch is

396
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,078
coming out of the stock and it just

397
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,120
makes a nice branch

398
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,399
some of these phenotypes will do almost

399
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,919
a web liked look and it doesn't appear

400
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,720
at the top part of the of the node at

401
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,699
the intersection if you will it happens

402
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,740
more at the base where the branch comes

403
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,360
out so it's hard to describe without

404
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,560
drawing or showing you a picture but I'm

405
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,079
going to do my best here with the Power

406
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,719
of Words most of the time like I said

407
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,819
the stock will go straight up then the

408
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,920
branch will come out at like a 45 degree

409
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,079
just sticking right out of it

410
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,519
at that 45 degree it just looks like an

411
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,899
angle there on the top and the bottom it

412
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,919
just looks like you just put two sticks

413
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,139
together

414
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,059
with the Lemon Skunk phenotype sometimes

415
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,399
the bottom part of that it looks really

416
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,838
clean instead of just an angle it looks

417
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,339
like you kind of took a decorative piece

418
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,740
of trim and stuck it in that angle and

419
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,139
curved out the angle a little bit almost

420
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,820
maybe the best way I can describe it is

421
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,500
this thing between your finger and your

422
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,720
thumb it doesn't just go finger thumb

423
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,639
there's this weird webbing in there the

424
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,620
plants kind of do that as well but it's

425
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
on the bottom part so it'd be this way

426
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,100
if you're making they're making a seven

427
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,860
it'd be down here is where that happens

428
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,079
so that shows up if you see that that's

429
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,720
not a problem that's a good phenotype I

430
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,299
enjoy that phenotype that passes so much

431
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,579
of that lemon candy lemon

432
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,620
um sorbet sort of a soft Country Time

433
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,778
Lemonade powder lemon heads kind of a

434
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,459
thing that phenotype with that webbing

435
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,679
in there that's going to have that a lot

436
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:13,679
in my experience

437
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,958
you're also going to see long skinny

438
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,698
leaves with long petioles those leaves

439
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,739
stick out of the buds maybe an inch inch

440
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,379
and a half maybe two inches before you

441
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,360
even get a leaf a lot of the phenotypes

442
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,360
if you do see the phenotype that

443
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,220
produces a small Bud cluster on the

444
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,539
petiole so you'll have a leaf you'll

445
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,160
have a bud just let's say the

446
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,899
microphone's the bud you got your big

447
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,000
bud then you got leaves sticking out of

448
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,620
the sides right just like this sometimes

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,139
I'm going to go this way so you can see

450
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,060
sometimes some of the leaves will make a

451
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,860
little bud cluster right here just on

452
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,239
top of the leaf at the Middle where the

453
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,740
fingers all start coming out where the

454
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,079
petiole and the leaves separate and meet

455
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,360
you'll get a little tiny nug cluster

456
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,759
there that is not a problem that is not

457
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,379
rare ah that is because that plant is

458
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,778
super happy the plants will do that when

459
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,059
they were happy when they are happy I've

460
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:01,860
noticed a lot of Jack the Ripper crosses

461
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,778
do that when they are happy about life

462
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,339
things with Jack the Ripper in there I

463
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,559
noticed it when subcool was putting out

464
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,240
seeds I grew a lot of sub cool stuff if

465
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,619
I would get some of his stuff just right

466
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,019
it would put out those little bud

467
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,639
clusters right in the petiole I'm pretty

468
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,320
sure that's coming from Jack the Ripper

469
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,419
is what causes that because subcool got

470
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,459
it I got it the commonality there of

471
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:22,679
course is that Jack the Ripper so you'll

472
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,078
see those long thin leaves with thin

473
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,939
petals now there are two different types

474
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,698
of leaves they come from these plants

475
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,920
they're both long skinny very serrated

476
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:35,819
leaves however the Jack the Ripper

477
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:38,639
phenotype doesn't have a canoe type

478
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,860
shape to the leaf I know that may be

479
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,720
vague and hard to figure out but let me

480
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,360
elaborate a little bit the Jack the

481
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,980
Ripper has more of a classic cannabis

482
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,839
serration leaf it's just got the five

483
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,940
fingers that come out they're serrated

484
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,180
they're super skinny but it just looks

485
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,040
like a ganja Leaf The Lemon Skunk the

486
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,899
leaf will get real skinny at the base

487
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,299
and it gets kind of wider in the middle

488
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,458
and then it gets real skinny and has a

489
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,619
nice curve to the shape of the leaf the

490
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,659
Jack the Ripper does not have that so

491
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,818
that's one good indicator of which way

492
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,679
your phenotype is leaning if you've got

493
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,838
that curved leaf or just a leaf that

494
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,040
just goes out and in you'll be able to

495
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,659
tell the difference if you've got that

496
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,519
curved Leaf you'll definitely know what

497
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm talking about most of these

498
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,660
phenotypes are going to make beautiful

499
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,640
bright green colors with bright bright

500
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,679
green pistols they are beautiful and

501
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,419
they smell amazing now since I'm talking

502
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,220
about phenotypes I'm going to give this

503
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,380
disclaimer that I give a lot

504
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,819
I told you my favorite phenotype is the

505
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,919
one with the thick stock the one that

506
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,259
gets the webbing the one that gets that

507
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,480
real big fat top Cola and smells like

508
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,640
crazy lemon candy and limes

509
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,798
that's the phenotype for me

510
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,480
that plan is also not the easiest plant

511
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,879
in the world to grow there are easier

512
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,319
phenotypes amongst this cross that you

513
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
could pull out of there and have much

514
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,058
better success with with less effort if

515
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,400
you're not as experienced of a grower so

516
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,319
that the phenotype I love may not be the

517
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
phenotype that you are going to fall in

518
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,980
love with don't let me tell you which

519
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,600
phenotype is the best I'm telling you

520
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,120
what I like I've made this analogy

521
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,159
before I've driven you to the Jack the

522
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,298
TR the Jack Tripper restaurant that

523
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,220
you've got to choose off the Jack

524
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,139
Tripper menu which meal you want there

525
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm gonna get this meal you get that

526
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,679
meal we made we want the same restaurant

527
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,320
but we might want slight different

528
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,120
variations in our entree so that's up to

529
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,859
you to decide

530
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,659
um The Lemon Skunk phenotypes are a

531
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,159
little more picky at growing that's what

532
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,660
I keep leading up to the Lemon Skunk

533
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,980
phenotypes are a little bit more

534
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,320
challenging the Jack the Ripper

535
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,839
phenotypes simple to grow anybody could

536
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,579
do that the Jack The Lemon Skunk

537
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,159
phenotypes are a little deceiving

538
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,259
sometimes if you upset them just a

539
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,580
little teeny tiny bit the leaves will

540
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,379
turn Super yellow some of the leaves

541
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,359
will fall off they'll start drooping and

542
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,340
they'll look like [ __ ] this plant just

543
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,259
it'll recover it does well but it just

544
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,939
goes into [ __ ] panic mode for no

545
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,798
reason if you just look at it wrong if

546
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,480
you fart near it if you sneeze in the

547
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,160
grow room some of the leaves might just

548
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,440
come off of this plant it's finicky it's

549
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,779
picky but it is worth it the medicine

550
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,519
the product that that plant produces the

551
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,099
concentrates that come from these plants

552
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,500
are so worth the extra work that it does

553
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:09,719
take the Jack the Ripper phenotype will

554
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,000
take anything you throw at it you can

555
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,360
top it you can scrag it pinch it pop it

556
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,400
twist it lollipop it anything you want

557
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,538
to do to it it will take it she takes

558
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,419
defoliation very well but do not over

559
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,038
defoliate that Lemon Skunk phenotype the

560
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,100
one that looks more lemon skunky the

561
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:31,679
less dense buds more Airy buds those

562
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,939
longer leaves don't over defoliate that

563
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,980
one because she doesn't make a lot of

564
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,419
leaves anyway she really wants the

565
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,880
leaves that are there if you take them

566
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,200
off it will piss her off and when you do

567
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,179
start pissing her off it takes a minute

568
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,419
for her to recover she will come back

569
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,220
but she does take a little bit if you

570
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,220
don't top The Lemon Skunk phenotype you

571
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,720
get one giant giant Glory butt I

572
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,940
recommend topping these plants unless

573
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,620
you want to do short sea of green plants

574
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,720
I do recommend topping all of these

575
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,279
plants uh spread them out real far it

576
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,200
will be helpful they like a lot of

577
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,740
airflow let's prevent some mold because

578
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,340
the buds are going to get giant

579
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,779
um

580
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,459
so if you don't top them they're going

581
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,558
to get giant giant top colas you're

582
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,179
gonna have a room full of giant tops

583
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,798
even if you do spread this out trellis

584
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,019
it properly you're going to get a bunch

585
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,538
of giant tops in the room pay attention

586
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,160
to your VPD Laden flower as these plants

587
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:21,839
get larger they will transpire and

588
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,360
respirate more there'll be more moisture

589
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,699
in the air you may need to increase CO2

590
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,319
decrease humidity you're gonna have

591
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,779
giant buds you're gonna have giant

592
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,819
plants you don't want to risk the run

593
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,160
the risk of getting mold inside of these

594
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,798
giant buds so do pay attention to your

595
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,779
VPD later in flower I've never had a

596
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,700
jack trip or plant mold up on me but

597
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,139
I've had some giant buds that have made

598
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,600
me worried about it so I always reduce

599
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,860
that VPD just a little bit get it a

600
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,959
little drier in the room get more

601
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,339
airflow pay attention to stuff like that

602
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,259
if you could top it if you could spread

603
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:53,759
it out instead of getting one giant Bud

604
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,319
get a whole bunch of buds amongst the

605
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,519
room I would recommend that if you're

606
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,798
going to go for just a bunch of Glory

607
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,679
buds grow small plants and flower them

608
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,079
very quickly let me catch up on my notes

609
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,120
Here don't over water these plants these

610
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,240
plants do not like to be over watered

611
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,439
they do not like to sit in water

612
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,538
sometimes when I go out of town or if

613
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,460
I'm doing a holiday thing I will simply

614
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,960
over water and just leave a little bit

615
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,720
of water in the tray so that I could buy

616
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,640
myself two or three days more time these

617
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,319
plants do not respond very well to that

618
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,179
at all they'll get pissy they'll get

619
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,099
yellow they'll start slowing down

620
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,900
they'll get droopy the leaves will fall

621
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,779
off and turn yellow on you don't do that

622
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,298
stuff to these plants they get very very

623
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,819
pissy some of these plants are perfect

624
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:38,099
just top them scrag them out fill a

625
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,079
scrog net you will find some phenotypes

626
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,579
in here that are beautiful for a sea of

627
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,619
green method you'll get that one big

628
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,298
Glory Bud trim off most of the side

629
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,219
branching get all that lateral branching

630
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,960
out of the way cram a bunch of them in

631
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,480
real tight pack the room you could pack

632
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,779
a lot of weight in one room if you fill

633
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,120
it correctly most of these phenotypes

634
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:00,058
are going to make a giant baseball bat

635
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,038
colas the mom plant made giant Buds and

636
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:03,359
the father plant made giant buds all of

637
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,400
the other phenotypes of the Jack the

638
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,699
Ripper made giant buds you're gonna get

639
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,019
Giant baseball bat donkey dick colas out

640
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,360
of these plants you're going to need

641
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,980
some sort of supports I recommended

642
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,658
trellis I always recommend a trellis

643
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,579
spread them out a little bit but maybe

644
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,620
some sticks maybe some tomato cages

645
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,798
these will need some sort of support

646
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,779
they're going to get big and beefy most

647
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:28,500
of these phenotypes if not all of them

648
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,879
are going to Triple in size before they

649
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,038
finish flowering that's right they're

650
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,659
going to triple if you've got six feet

651
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:35,700
of grow space and you've got to keep in

652
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,980
mind space between the light I'm going

653
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,080
to say that your grow light is seven to

654
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,179
eight feet high that gives you six feet

655
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,740
of vertical space to grow in I would

656
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,960
recommend you flour these plants when

657
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,000
they are two feet tall if you're giving

658
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,980
them proper light proper nutrients good

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,980
air flow if you take good care of them

660
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,380
these plants will triple in size before

661
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,360
they are done flowering so be prepared

662
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,340
be prepared for tall plants don't expect

663
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,719
just short plants that are just going to

664
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,000
grow and finish I'm telling you now

665
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,220
they're going to get tall as [ __ ] be

666
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,900
ready for that some of the phenotypes do

667
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,000
like to Branch out quite a bit so

668
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,860
possibly be prepared for branchy plants

669
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,900
but they are going to get tall they are

670
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:14,579
going to take up a lot of space some of

671
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,919
them may be a little bit lanky on you

672
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,720
most of the phenotypes that long lanky

673
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,820
arm if you don't lollipop too much and

674
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,038
trim too much up too low all of that

675
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,259
space will fill in it will all fill in

676
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,058
with big fat chunky nuggets so don't

677
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,400
clean up too much of them on the bottom

678
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:31,798
one thing I definitely recommend is

679
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,320
flour the first run early don't be too

680
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,000
stuck on having a major huge Harvest on

681
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,158
your first crop Focus your first run

682
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,659
with these plants on just learning what

683
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,059
they do and how tall they are going to

684
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,679
get and finding your phenotype find out

685
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,960
how tall it's going to get then run it

686
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,880
big the second time third time build a

687
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,519
relationship with the plant at that rate

688
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,559
these plants are super easy to trim they

689
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,298
don't produce a lot of large leaves and

690
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,798
all of the Sugar Leaf on there all the

691
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:57,418
small Leaf whatever you guys want to

692
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,579
call it in your location wherever you

693
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,960
are all of that leaf is going to be so

694
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,939
Frosty that if you're making

695
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,319
concentrates don't waste time cutting

696
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,600
that off of there you can do a

697
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,819
pre-harvest defoliation by taking off

698
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,678
all of the giant leaves any leaf with a

699
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,839
petiole right before Harvest pull that

700
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,460
[ __ ] off get that off of there then chop

701
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,678
down the plants let them dry for a few

702
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,360
days and go back and just manicure all

703
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,038
that small Leaf off and keep that small

704
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,839
leaf and make edibles or concentrates

705
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,480
out of it because all of the leaves on

706
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,279
these plants are coated in trichomes so

707
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,798
they're super easy to trim they make

708
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,259
amazing concentrates super delicious

709
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,960
almost Panic inducing concentrates if

710
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,400
you make rosin if you make BHO any type

711
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,500
of concentrates if you're just pressing

712
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,120
it if you're making bubble however you

713
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,859
do it these concentrates will give you

714
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,899
that like straight to the eye straight

715
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,819
to the head you're like oh [ __ ] man I'm

716
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,200
too high for this what's going on and

717
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:48,538
nothing's going on man you're just High

718
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,640
bro I really like it it's like sweaty

719
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:52,200
Palm sweaty armpit kind of weed you're

720
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,059
like looking for your keys and [ __ ] but

721
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,440
your keys are in your hand like that's

722
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,599
that's definitely the kind of herb that

723
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,038
this is now I've talked about phenotypes

724
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,199
we've talked about the buzz we've talked

725
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,720
about the flavors and Aromas let's talk

726
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,640
a little bit about feeding these plants

727
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,620
one thing I've really noticed with the

728
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,960
Jack Tripper plants is they tend to like

729
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,779
a little bit higher pH than most of the

730
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,620
things I breed and grow most of the time

731
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:20,399
I feed my plants a pH somewhere between

732
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:22,619
6.1 and 6.4 I run on a soilless mix I

733
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,720
mix up my nutrient throw my pH pin in

734
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,058
there I like six one to six four is

735
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,839
usually where I aim for these plants

736
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,940
seem to act better in 6.6 I was noticing

737
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,980
something just wasn't right so I just

738
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,259
increased that pH just a little bit they

739
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,880
were not uptaking nutrients a priests

740
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,379
that increase that pH just a little bit

741
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
guess what the little [ __ ] took off

742
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,340
and started eating everything I was

743
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,319
giving them I'm not sure if it was

744
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:48,720
potassium or calcium that they were

745
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,079
lacking but one of them was not uptaking

746
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,659
uh in their late veg phase early flower

747
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,099
phase as soon as I increase that pH they

748
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,600
took right the [ __ ] off and started

749
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,778
eating everything I was feeding them

750
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,480
there were no feed problems at all so

751
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,679
maybe if you're experiencing any issues

752
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,360
with these plants a little bit of

753
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,179
yellowing a little bit of slowed growth

754
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,979
increase that pH just a little bit my

755
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,259
experience I grew these plants most of

756
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,360
my grow is usually in a soilless mix I'm

757
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,579
not super picky about the soilless mix I

758
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,959
buy I like to buy especially since we

759
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,220
had all these [ __ ] shipping delays

760
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,900
and everything was weird in my local

761
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,579
grow shop closed down so I got to drive

762
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,980
[ __ ] to another city right now to buy

763
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,960
soil or soilless mix I buy what they've

764
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,179
got a lot of what will fill my needs

765
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,740
because sometimes what I like and what I

766
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,840
prefer is not there so I try to be

767
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,700
flexible and adapt to what I can get I'm

768
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,980
getting soilless mix I think I was using

769
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,019
HP Pro mix with the mycorrhiza this time

770
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,120
because that's simply what was available

771
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,798
I feed it New Millennium bottled

772
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,500
nutrients with a little bit of recharge

773
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,359
I like to put plus life in there during

774
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,919
the boosting phase I like to give it

775
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,000
what's when I always forget the name of

776
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,259
you guys you guys know what I'm talking

777
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,058
about people are yelling at their

778
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,038
[ __ ] phones right now saying that

779
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:57,480
product is called Bud swell Rasta Jeff

780
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,058
budswell's the other product I like to

781
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,860
use and then I add some shine in there

782
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,720
um of course some fulvic acid some Ruby

783
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,038
and then a few other small things and

784
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,019
there may be some green sensation you

785
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,119
never know what I might be adding in but

786
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:11,658
in my soilless mix I noticed they did

787
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,099
prefer a little bit high pH like a 6.6

788
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:16,620
they see more green and just healthier

789
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,359
and more active at that higher pH the

790
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:20,158
plants seem to like most of these growth

791
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,000
Styles I saw pictures of these plants

792
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,340
being grown on a 5x5 5 table the what is

793
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,079
it when you flood the drain table they

794
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,480
were just recycling the flood to drain

795
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,278
water they had rock wool cubes on there

796
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,960
these plants from the base of that

797
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,058
rockwool Cube up to the tip of these

798
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,519
plants was just all nuggets I was

799
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,778
[ __ ] impressed with that let's talk a

800
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,519
little bit so these plants seem to like

801
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:43,319
the hydro is something that I'm leading

802
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,960
at they like soilless mix they like

803
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:48,658
Hydro they seem to like anything

804
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,460
um they like a humid room but be careful

805
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,919
Laden flower because the buds are going

806
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,440
to get huge these are tropical plants

807
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,600
they got that skinny leaf and they tend

808
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,298
to react very well to a little bit of a

809
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,859
humid room more humid than usual but be

810
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,679
careful because you're going to get big

811
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:07,019
chunky buds at the end these plants also

812
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,538
like a lot of light I've never burned

813
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,759
these plants with my LEDs I'm running uh

814
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:14,038
Canon LEDs in one room and I get these

815
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,460
plants fairly close and they have never

816
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:20,400
been burned from the LEDs these plants

817
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,140
do act very well and react very well to

818
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,440
just conventional white Cycles I I

819
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,380
usually run 18 6 or 19.5 for my veg they

820
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,320
liked that very well they like 12 12 or

821
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,840
11 13 very well one thing I noticed

822
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,939
they don't seem to like modified or

823
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,199
alternate light schedules you guys

824
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,778
notice I've been talking about different

825
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,360
light schedules on my podcast don't do

826
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,298
that to Jack Tripper they don't seem to

827
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,158
like it they like moderate feeding too

828
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,319
much nitrogen in the flowering phase

829
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,360
will give these plants what I call the

830
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:53,220
spiral staircase I talk about this often

831
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,599
in my opinion if you overfeed your

832
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,278
plants too much nitrogen in the

833
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,798
beginning they start to stretch a little

834
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,419
bit and when the bud starts forming it

835
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,099
doesn't cluster up here and cluster up

836
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,778
here and meet it starts doing a little

837
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,980
bud here a little bud here a little bud

838
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:07,319
here and it just does the spiral

839
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,519
staircase it never Stacks properly they

840
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,859
never meet up the way that they should

841
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,079
they don't form properly that's just

842
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,079
from over feeding that is my opinion so

843
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,058
don't over feed these plants some of

844
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,678
these phenotypes they'll kind of stretch

845
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,538
out too much if you over feed them but

846
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,519
some of them will get fingery and

847
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:25,619
foxtaily and start making little Nubs on

848
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,480
the buds and little fisty shaped buds

849
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:31,019
that don't look pretty so don't over

850
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,558
feed those Jack Tripper plants are going

851
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,480
to take honestly 10 or more weeks to

852
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,298
finish if you are not ready for a 10

853
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,240
week plant don't commit to Jack dripper

854
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:45,359
seeds these are labeled 10 plus weeks

855
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,759
you're looking at 70 to 77 maybe more

856
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,459
days to finish these plants most of the

857
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,500
phenotypes are done around Day 72 there

858
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,419
are outliers there are always outliers

859
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,839
there may be earlier there may be later

860
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,940
but prepare for 72 to 75 solid days

861
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,740
before these plants are ready to harvest

862
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,659
I know I say this a lot when I talk

863
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,339
about Harvest times but it's very

864
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,620
important to let these plants finish

865
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,839
these plants really do something extra

866
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:11,519
in the last week of flowering they

867
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,259
really put on some density they really

868
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,759
bulk up a little bit while you're

869
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,839
waiting for those trichomes they look

870
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,099
like they're ready they look like

871
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,259
they're ready they're just not ready

872
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:20,759
give them time to get ready because

873
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,079
they're bulking up they're adding more

874
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,819
weight they're getting better as you

875
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,398
wait don't be impatient with these

876
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,079
plants let them finish if you give these

877
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,819
plants the opportunity to finish you

878
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,678
will see right at the end they do bulk

879
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,898
up and beef up just a little bit bit

880
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,059
extra on their own don't change anything

881
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,099
do what you normally do you'll notice

882
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:40,259
that they do finish up quite nicely

883
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:42,480
alright that basically wraps up my

884
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,460
report on Jack Tripper but I do have one

885
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,440
more detail I want to address in this

886
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,720
episode when people are shopping for

887
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,058
seeds they often ask me what is the

888
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,919
difference between John lemon and Jack

889
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,839
Tripper they're quite similar they're

890
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,700
also quite different let's talk about

891
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,339
both of these strains like I've

892
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,940
mentioned Jack Tripper is a Lemon Skunk

893
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:06,119
female and a Jack the Ripper male you

894
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,980
get a lot of soft candy lemon flavors

895
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,759
now let's talk a little bit about John

896
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:14,399
Lemon that is a sour diesel female and a

897
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,440
BC Lemon Skunk male so you're getting a

898
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,139
lot of that sour lemon flavor but

899
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,820
there's also a funky diesel thing to it

900
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,559
so the main differences in these two

901
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:25,019
strains are going to be that the Jack

902
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,538
Tripper is more of a soft lemon candy

903
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,839
lemon sorbet Country Time Lemonade

904
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:34,140
gentle lemon candy sort of a flavor the

905
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,658
John lemon is more of a lemon peel sour

906
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,659
lemons astringent kind of a pissy cat

907
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,659
piss kind of a funky sour gross but

908
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,520
Delicious lemon Aroma and flavor so if

909
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,440
you like that lemon candy I recommend

910
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,740
Jack Tripper if you're into the pissy

911
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,899
sour lemons I will recommend John lemon

912
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,460
and when I say pissy sour lemons I know

913
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,259
that sounds gross but if you're a

914
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,899
cannabis connoisseur you know how

915
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,819
delicious that really is all right that

00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,439
