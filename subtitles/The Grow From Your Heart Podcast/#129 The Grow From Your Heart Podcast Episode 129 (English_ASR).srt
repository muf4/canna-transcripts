consume your cannabis I hope you were

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,658
doing it it's kind of weird without the

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,040
cannabis cup here in Denver this year

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,030
everybody spread out I don't know where

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
the party is I don't know where

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,689
everybody's going to be but I know where

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,430
I am going to be that's right I will be

42
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,929
at the secret stash if you want to learn

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,600
more about the secret stash hosted by my

44
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,759
friend Adam Hill I also heard a rumor DJ

45
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,589
jokey would be DJing the event make sure

46
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,959
you check out secret stash Colorado on

47
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,299
Instagram I cannot do anything to get

48
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,159
you tickets I was lucky enough to get

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,469
myself one ticket because of course I am

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,750
family I've got one for myself that's

51
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,780
all I've got I apologize I cannot help

52
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,340
you get in I can't do anything for you

53
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,960
figure out how to find their Instagram

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,960
and then there are instructions on their

55
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,399
Instagram on how to try to get yourself

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,618
into the event by the time this airs it

57
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,659
may be full so good luck I hope to see

58
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,879
it there I want to talk about something

59
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,219
that I saw on the Cannabis just recently

60
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,799
this is a little bit related to the

61
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,569
cannabis cup not being here in Denver

62
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,129
that looks like a lot of people kind of

63
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,169
back down on coming to Colorado without

64
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,299
the giant cannabis cup but I'm gonna

65
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,679
read an article from the cannabis and

66
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:25,170
the headline goes like this Cypress

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,379
Hills cannabis cup concert just moved to

68
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,750
a much smaller venue the sub-headline

69
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,549
says I think that's called the byline

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,919
that says fewer people will be getting

71
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,500
insane in the brain for 4/20 this week

72
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,059
then this article is by Ricardo Baca of

73
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,069
course from the cannabis stand it says

74
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,810
and the hits to the cannabis cup in

75
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,578
Colorado keep coming first the US

76
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,590
cannabis cup got booted from its Denver

77
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,719
adjacent home and its plan to stage a

78
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,579
cup in southern Colorado fell apart then

79
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,799
High Times magazines largest event moved

80
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,799

a week before Showtime

88
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,750
and even with mother excuse me let me

89
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,670
try that sense again and even with the

90
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,180
move to the smaller venue tickets are

91
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:18,799

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,150
good for the Ogden and a limited number

99
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,099
of tickets remain and are on sale now

100
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,500

Bronson and chronics you guys you've

104
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,780
heard chronics on this podcast I might

105
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,189
write it down to end of the show with

106
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,030
chronics I'm gonna put a little note on

107
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,530
myself there we go

108
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,729
I'll probably in the podcast with

109
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,430
chronics it's when my favorite rate

110
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:57,280
reggae artists chronics with two x's at

111
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,379
the end make sure you check that out

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,669
great artists I wasn't gonna go to this

113
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,199
show you guys because it was at the

114
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,509
First Bank Center it's kind of a big

115
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,739
event it's kind of a big venue unless

116
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:08,239
you're up in the front and those big

117
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,890
venues it's just a party and you only

118
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,680
really get to see the concert the

119
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,569
artists I want to see is the least known

120
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,819
artist on the bill so he's going to play

121
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,370
first he'll probably get like 30 minutes

122
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:22,129
to play but in a small venue like that

123
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,689
it might be worth it for me to go when

124
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,040
you're 65 and you got dreadlocks down to

125
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,269
your ass and a reggae band starts

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,620
playing and you know all the words and

127
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,299
you walk from the front people move the

128
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,160
[Â __Â ] out of your way so I just go right

129
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,079
up front and check out chronics and then

130
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,010
I'd be gone by the time I might check

131
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,930
out Action Bronson and

132
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,069
parliament-funkadelic that'd be fun but

133
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,600
yeah I'd stick around and see the rest

134
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,680
of it if I paid 65 for a ticket but I

135
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,910
just want to go see chronic see guys

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,160
it'd be a great time in that little tiny

137
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,410
club I'm gonna continue with this

138
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,870
article here it says so why didn't the

139
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,669
event sell surely the lack of accompany

140
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,199
cannabis cup Expo didn't help ticket

141
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:53,209
sales and with Snoop Dogg playing

142
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,180
fillers Green Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne

143
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,859
playing the 4/20 rally and Method Man

144
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,530
and Redman playing red rocks all in the

145
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,229
same week competition is no doubt fierce

146
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:05,809
is this venue downsizing indicative of

147
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:08,120
the 4/20 to come it's too early to say

148
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,759
but Colorado will surely see fewer

149
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,850
cannabis tourists this 4/20 because of

150
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,199
the cups move West that is absolutely

151
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,879
true a lot of my friends that normally

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,620
would come out to Colorado for the 4/20

153
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,399
weekend from California from Oregon from

154
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,959
Washington from

155
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,029
again from all over the damn place from

156
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,469
North Carolina they're not coming out

157
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,819
because there's no cannabis cup this

158
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,560
year there are a lot of vendors that I'd

159
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,199
like to hang out with that probably I

160
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,610
will not see this year because we

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,978
usually bump into each other either at

162
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,509
the cannabis cup or age so unless

163
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,939
they're at age in the winter or the fall

164
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,580
time I will not see them shout out to

everybody that shows up at all the

168
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,478
events there's one group in my head that

169
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,610
I'm thinking of that I cannot think of

170
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,500
Johnny being the no GU crew how did I

171
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,970

176
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,788
Jools all kinds of folks that I'm not

178
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:07,079
cannabis cup it kind of sucks uh I feel

179
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,550
like I'm just ranting and screaming

180
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,870
about not getting a cannabis cup I feel

181
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,699
like a little [Â __Â ] suddenly I'll quit

182
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,870
whining about that on this concert you

183
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,728
guys it sounds like a lot of fun they've

184
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,259
moved it to this small venue but they

185
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,598
did put out a press release and it says

186
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,000
you cannot medicate in this facility so

187
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,620
there will be no ganja smoking that's

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,720
what they say they always say that kind

189
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,340
of [Â __Â ] at these events but this video

190
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,710
is tiny and they can see you from all

191
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,060
angles so I don't know what they're

192
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,978
gonna do if one person starts puffing

193
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,269
and then two people start and then the

194
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,550
whole place is smoking they can't kick

195
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,750
everybody out but at the same time you

196
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,460
never know what they're gonna try to do

197
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,509
they're gonna say no smoking they'll

198
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,819
probably just let you do in there anyway

199
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,319
oh sorry I'm burping the wall I'm

200
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,228
recording a podcast shout out to Dr

201
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,598
Pepper 23 flavors love it gotta happen

202
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:50,189
all right you guys that was my my news

203
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,538
article I'm not gonna read any more news

204
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,250
in this episode I'll go ahead and close

205
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,430
that web browser and we will go ahead

206
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,908
and focus on some emails I did an

207
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,519
episode about listener emails and that

208
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:04,680
spawned more emails somebody sent me a

209
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,269
message about a probiotic I mentioned

210
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,639
that I like to consume probiotics I like

211
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,620
kombucha and fermented products I think

212
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,090
they're good for digestion I have some

213
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,319
stomach problems which is part of why I

214
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,109
have a medical marijuana recommendation

215
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,189
it'll talk a lot about that I don't

216
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,620
think anybody really wants to hear about

217
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:20,969
my medical conditions but my stomach is

218
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,500
messed up it's wrecked I like to take

219
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,880
probiotics it makes me feel like my food

220
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,189
digests better it makes me feel like my

221
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,689
body's better I think your gut health

222
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,038
has a lot to do with your mental health

223
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,168
and your physical health so it all

224
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,939
starts in the gut so probiotics and good

225
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:34,259
food one of our listeners sent me an

226
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,269
email asking about ace

227
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,430
Pacific probiotic and to tell you the

228
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,649
truth I lost the message I cannot find

229
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,980
where that message came in I can't find

230
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,659
it on the Facebook pages the Instagram I

231
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,819
can't find it in any of my emails

232
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,410
um you asked if I had heard about a

233
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,819
product or if I am familiar with the

234
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,160
product honestly I've never heard of

235
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,689
that product I intended to save the

236
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,100
message you sent and go and research

237
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,300
that product and tell you what I thought

238
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,580
about it but honestly I don't know what

239
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,470
happened to the damn message so if you

240
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,870

241
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,150
easier send me it again on an email I

242
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,990
grow from your heart at hotmail.com that

243
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,839

245

246
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,629
apologize for losing the damn email

247
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,160
I drove me crazy I spent about two hours

248
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,000
just searching for that email seriously

249
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,500
not all at one time

250
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,730
but I've put about two hours into

251
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,110
looking for that thing probably and I

252
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,230
can't find the message so I apologize

253
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,960

254
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,819
our next email comes from I'm opening

255
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,739
the message right now this message came

256
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,850
from a friend of ours I'm not sure if he

257
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,820
wants me to say his name so I'm not

258
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,350
gonna but it says um I'm a new listener

259
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,210
to the show and I gotta say I'm a huge

260
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,500
fan I'm very thankful for the wealth of

261
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,450
information you provided all the

262
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,710
knowledgeable guests you bring on I am

263
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,030
listening from another state at the

264
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,530
moment but have plans on moving to

265
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,289
Colorado soon to get involved in the

266
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:51,569
industry any way I can I listen to the

267
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:53,069
episode about the meed badges and I just

268
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,080
had a few more questions if you have

269
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,360
your med badge does that mean you can go

270
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,430
into a medical dispensary as a customer

271
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,139
to buy products as well or is that a

272
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:03,089
different car I hope that makes sense

273
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,529
but think again thanks again for

274
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,860
everything and I look forward to meeting

275
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,899
you one day I look forward to meeting

276
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,279
you too I hope you get to take some phat

277
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,049
dad's hopefully smoke some flowers

278
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,699
together I would like to see what kind

279
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,559
of flowers you are getting in your

280
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,970
location and I'll show you what kind of

281
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,519
flowers we've got here and we can smoke

282
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,290
down together you're a new listener I

283
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,730
encourage you to go back and listen to a

284
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:26,250
few of the older episodes if you're a

285
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,620
new listener listened to I think it's 50

286
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,080
55 and there's an episode about

287
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,639
scheduling your grow scheduling a

288
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,470
perpetual grow there's an episodes about

289
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,819
building your garden I strongly

290
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,800
recommend listening to some of those

291
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,920
more educational in-depth informative

292
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,939
episodes um what else did you say here

293
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,599
you're very thankful well you're very

294
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,610
welcome

295
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,370
definitely very welcome your main

296
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,940
question is

297
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,070
the meed badge doesn't work like a

298
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,870
colorado red card or a medical marijuana

299
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,910
recommendation the red cards are now

300
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,909
purple which is a drastic change anyway

301
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:01,579
no the main answer is no the Colorado

302
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:03,079
meed badge does not work the same as

303
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,389
your Colorado medical marijuana

304
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,250
recommendation you cannot shop in a

305
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,309
medical marijuana facility just because

306
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,919
your badge it does not work like that

307
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:14,599
your badge we'll get you some discounts

308
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,179
and other dispensaries if you shop at a

309
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,070
dispensary it also gets you into some of

310
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:20,838
the smoke lounges for free I know that

311
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,400
if I wear my badge to the can of canyon

312
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,050
Camile does not charge me to get in

313
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,459
Camille has never charged me no one's

314
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,719
ever charged me to get into the cannon

315
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,670
Canyon because I do advertising and I

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,980
show love to the community but if you

317
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,539
have an M II D badge they will not

318
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,278
charge you to get into the cannon Canyon

319
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,259
is what most people would pay $5 at the

320
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,120
door so there are some perks of having

321
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:40,250
the badge just some industry perks some

322
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,810
friendly things that come but it does

323
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,839
not work as a medical marijuana

324
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,278
recommendation to get a medical

325
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,960
marijuana recommendation to get into a

326
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,460
medical marijuana facility you do need

327
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,170
to see a doctor there's no doctor

328
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,839
involved in the meed

329
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,860
paperwork and questionnaire so I hope

330
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,810
that answers your question

331
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,089
one thing I will mention if you do have

332
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:02,329
a Colorado medical marijuana card you

333
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,160
can use that card in Las Vegas in the

334
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,020
state of Nevada Nevada has medical

335
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,789
marijuana and they do a reciprocal

336
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,679
program where other states cards work

337
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:11,329
there so if you're a tourist and you are

338
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,129
in Las Vegas or if you're in the state

339
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,509
of Nevada before you go to the bunny

340
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,509
ranch you can stop and grab yourself

341
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:19,338
some ganja so big up to Nevada for being

342
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,200
a reciprocating state on the medical

343
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,570
marijuana recommendation cards that is

344
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,370
super cool so I hope that answered your

345
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,290
question I appreciate the email please

346
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,799

347
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:33,199
the listener interaction all right I got

348
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,179
another email this is a Facebook message

349
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,390
from a friend of ours and he asked me

350
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,579
basically what stops people or is it

351
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,830
possible for somebody to buy a package

352
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,080
of seeds and grow some plants out of it

353
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,120
and then call those plants something

354
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,100
else and then enter cannabis cups or

355
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,899
other competitions with something that

356
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,040
they claim is something babe red but is

357
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,649
actually something that they have

358
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,689
purchased from a seed bank or they got a

359
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,669
clone from somebody and the answer to

360
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,050
that is nothing is stopping that other

361
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:02,019
than

362
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:04,870
our community and people's morals but

363
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,669
honestly if I sold you seeds of any

364
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,200
strain that I bred you could take them

365
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:10,059
home you could grow them you could find

366
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,560
the keeper you could wait three or four

367
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,028
months until everybody forgot that you

368
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,528
had that and you could say hey look what

369
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,870
I created you could name it your

370
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:18,159
whatever I've got Arrowhead water

371
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,509
bottles in front of me so I'm gonna see

372
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,399
you could say you bread your arrow head

373
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:22,958
and you can call it this Arrowhead you

374
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,600
could enter it into cannabis cups and

375
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,879
you're gonna fool a lot of people but

376
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,800
you won't fool the people that are

377
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,509
really into the industry that know what

378
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,669
strain is what strain there are guys

379
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,708
when we go to cannabis cups you can

380
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,120
smoke a flower somebody'll pass you a

381
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,278
joint and a lot of these guys will say

382
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,320
oh is that Aaron's og cush that he grew

383
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,240
over there at the clinic and people know

384
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,399
what these flowers taste like look like

385
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,200
smell like we're catching on all the

386
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,500
stuff that stands out there are very few

387
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,329
things that stand out enough to be Cup

388
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,919
winners and so when we smoke these

389
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,259
things we notice them we remember the

390
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,120
flavor remember the high then when we

391
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,679
smoke it again it's familiar so if you

392
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,570
try to pass it off as something else

393
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,689
somebody in the circle is gonna notice

394
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,190
but honestly 90% of the people in the

395
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,440
world would be fooled they will believe

396
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,420
you but the only thing stopping you from

397
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,970
doing it is having some morals and not

398
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,860
being a cannabis dick I don't remember

399
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,889
the year exactly but I do remember that

400
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,379
several years back there was a person

401
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,610
who bought a bunch of cannabis I don't

402
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,769
remember where he purchased the cannabis

403
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,778
I think he bought it from a coffee shop

404
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,879
in Amsterdam or from a grower in

405
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:30,070
Amsterdam in Holland and he entered it

406
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,100
into the cannabis cup in Amsterdam the

407
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,740
original cannabis cup and he walked

408
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,959
around and persuaded people at the cup

409
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,519
to vote for him as the best they kind of

410
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,439
bought votes from people it wasn't a

411
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,198
legitimately one cannabis cup but these

412
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,839
guys want a cup they kind of stole a cup

413
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,789
from DNA genetics by buying another

414
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,320
professional growers flowers and putting

415
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:52,659
their name on it and marketing it is

416
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,278
their name to create their new seed

417
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,370
company to make hype on their seed

418
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,870
company but a lot of the people most of

419
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,278
the folks in Amsterdam knew what it was

420
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,139
the people that were voting for them

421
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:03,909
were mostly tourists and people that

422
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:06,039
were not really familiar with the weed

423
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,569
game so all the people that all the

424
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,980
local Amsterdam had smoked it and they

425
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,778
were like hey this is whatever's haze

426
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,459
they knew whose haze it was they knew

427
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,740
exactly but these guys called it kooky

428
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,689
could

429
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,299
mouki and they [Â __Â ] won a cannabis

430
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,339
cup by stealing a stream renaming it and

431
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:20,958
entering it into the cup and then

432
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,430
persuading other people to vote for it

433
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,679
by kind of buying votes by giving them

434
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,719
weed by talking to them by kissing their

435
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,649
asses there's actually kind of a

436
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,330
documentary on it

437
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,509
if you want to google it and look for it

438
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,500
a lot ago find the name for you all

439
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,970
right you guys I did a little bit of

440
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,889
research all I can find is some stuff on

441
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,129
IC mag make sure you check out IC mag

442
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:42,080
comm join the forum it says in 2007

443
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,850
Hager produced a reality TV show based

444
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,770
around the high times offices titled

445
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,110
high times office the show's twelfth

446
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,759
episode culminated in the 20th cannabis

447
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,589
cup where big apple seeds from Brooklyn

448
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,870
New York want a blind taste test against

449
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,880
DNA seeds that was judged by Robert

450
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,190
Connell Clark it was later revealed in

451
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,049
high times that Doc and Dom the owners

452
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,560
of big apple seeds were actors and their

453
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,809
entry

454
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,119
ouki kabuki was actually Neville's Hays

455
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:08,359
purchased in Amsterdam from a pot broker

456
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,600
with a good nose for good weed

457
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,089
so that was posted up on icy mag from a

458
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,620
poster calls himself Saluki he looks

459
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,140
like he's well known on this place here

460
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,399
so I shout out just read part of your

461
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,629
post you don't even know who I am I

462
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,549
don't know who you are but you just got

463
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,320
a shout out so that is the legend of who

464
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:25,609
q kabuki and how that went there are a

465
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,750
lot of rumors on how that went down

466
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,950
that's just what I found on this one

467
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,139
form kind of brings back a lot of

468
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,940
memories so the original question was

469
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,338
can somebody steal a strain and rename

470
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,050
it yes they absolutely can in this

471
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,670
example these people didn't even grow it

472
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,169
they bought it and then entered it into

473
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:40,639
the cannabis cup and it was Neville's

474
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,719
haze which is always gonna win that's

475
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,088
one of the best strains on the planet

476
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,500
when grown properly you guys I have to

477
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,279

dot 303 shout out to the

495
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,220
me Gatsby alright let's get on with the

496
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,930
show I've got another email from a

497
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,290
listener this one is a question about

498
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:36,939
seed pack labeling and flowering times

499
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,129
and when you're looking at seed packs

500
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,149
online you look at a package and it will

501
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:44,919
say flowering time usually 56 to 63 days

502
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,740
is what most packages will say some will

503
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,419
say 60 to 70 days hopefully they're

504
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,190
writing the truth on there but usually

505
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:53,919
it's 8 to 9 weeks and they'll indicate

506
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,160
that by the number of days now what that

507
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,689
number is is the flowering time unless

508
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,429
you've got Auto flowering plants if

509
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,529
you've got Auto flower plants this does

510
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:05,558
not apply but if you've got regular

511
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:08,439
photo period plants this is what that

512
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,509
number means when a breeder labels his

513
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,019
package of seeds and it says that this

514
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:16,509
plant takes whatever 8 to 9 weeks or 56

515
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:18,250
to 63 days to finish that is the

516
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:20,289
flowering time that's how long that

517
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,959
plant is going to take to reach full

518
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,688
maturity from the time you initiate the

519
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,910
flowering period and that is when the

520
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,279
vary from the very first day you turn

521
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,250
the that timer to 1212 when the lights

522
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:36,548
go from 12 hours on to 12 hours off that

523
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,929
is now day one of that phase that nine

524
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:40,000
week period that's written on the

525
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,730
package has nothing to do with your veg

526
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,380
cycle you can veg those plants you can

527
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,089
sprout them as seedlings you can get

528
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,250
them like 2 inches tall and then you can

529
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:51,459
flower them if you want to so that could

530
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,319
be 20 days or you can sprout them you

531
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,210
can veg them for 12 weeks and take a

532
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,079
million clones and then flower I don't

533
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,700
know what you're gonna do with the

534
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,168
plants the breeder doesn't know either

535
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,880
you're the only one that knows what

536
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,950
you're gonna do with that so the veg

537
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,690
time is as long as you want it to be

538
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,880
okay the flowering time is what is

539
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,390
indicated on the package and it begins

540
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,830
the day you turn those lights to 1212 so

541
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,830
if that breeder Pak says that their

542
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:16,990
plants are going to take 56 to 63 days I

543
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:19,359
usually recommend going the full 63 days

544
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,890
unless it's completely obvious that that

545
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,719
plant is going to be done earlier

546
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,160
because of course some phenotypes are

547
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,319
going to finish sooner some are gonna

548
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,940
finish a little bit later I like to push

549
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,798
them I like to see what they're going to

550
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,690
do sometimes a plant won't start putting

551
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,039
on its bulk until the last couple of

552
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,480
weeks you might be cutting yourself out

553
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,579
of some weight you might be cutting

554
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,169
yourself out of potency sometimes those

555
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:39,259
plants will just throw on a whole nother

556
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,060
layer a trichome

557
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,379
right at the end you never know what you

558
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,359
might be missing if you cut down too

559
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,070
early so if the package says that it

560
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,049
could go nine weeks let it go nine full

561
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:49,970
weeks on the first run and then

562
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,799
hopefully you've got clones so now you

563
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,059
get to pick your favorite phenotype out

564
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,069
of that seed pack you get to run it

565
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,899
again and then you get to dial in

566
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:59,329
exactly how many days to flower that

567
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,980
plant for sometimes your first run with

568
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:03,109
the plant is just an experiment you got

569
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,240
to see what its gonna do so that's my

570
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:07,039
take on that the time indicator on the

571
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,660
pack is how long the plant will flower

572
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,759
so keep that in mind when you're

573
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,470
purchasing your seeds if you're looking

574
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,569
for a reputable seed vendor in the

575
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,950
United States I would recommend the dank

576
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:21,109
team calm the DEA NKT 'i am calm the

577
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,299
dank team calm let them know Rasta Jeff

578
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:25,939
sent you they have got things from

579
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,980
Gabe's green genetics sour seeds mile

580
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,539
hike an adventure they got a lot of

581
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,910
great stuff on there they may even have

582
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:34,460
some I read genetics I'm not sure what's

583
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:37,040
available you'll have to go and take a

584
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,519
look for yourself so let's move on to

585
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,319
another question this question actually

586
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,019
came from a friend of mine shoutout to

587
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,579
Lowe's I hope you're listening to this

588
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,769
there is a cultivar there's a clone

589
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,419
there's a varietal there is a stream

590
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:54,529
there's a plant that goes around our

591
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:57,710
region that is a Sour Diesel clone and

592
00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:00,920
when it has grown properly you cannot

593
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,710
keep it in a baggie and a jar you can't

594
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,019
put it in a baggie inside of a jar you

595
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,090
can't hide this weed from anybody if you

596
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:10,099
put it in a baggie in a jar and in your

597
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:12,769
car you can smell this Sour Diesel

598
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:16,339
outside of the car this [Â __Â ] is potent

599
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:19,009
this is some super loud weed this [Â __Â ]

600
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:21,919
is crazy but when I give it to a lot of

601
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:24,259
my friends they cannot grow it I myself

602
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,269
cannot grow this string worth a [Â __Â ] I

603
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,910
know three or four people that grow this

604
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:30,799
strain [Â __Â ] amazingly it comes out

605
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,600
beautifully the calyx is swell up it's

606
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,259
covered and resin it gets that gassy

607
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:39,319
fuel funk smell to it so me being the

608
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:41,059
inquisitive guy that I am ah I know if

609
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,919
you guys had grow it so I asked them I

610
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,259
was like hey how do you grow that Sour

611
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,970
Diesel and all three of the people that

612
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:50,000
grow it successfully have told me that

613
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,190
it grows in some type of a hydroponic

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,009
system

615
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,170
so what that leads me to think these

616
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:58,480
guys myself included that are trying to

617
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,900
grow this cultivar this clone is

618
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,360
varietal this plant this strain in a

619
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,880
soil or soilless mix we're not gonna

620
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,769
have much success because this plant was

621
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,830
probably phenol hunted from a pack of

622
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:14,500
seeds by somebody that grows in hydro

623
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:16,960
this plant was selected for a hydroponic

624
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,670
system I don't think anybody growing it

625
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,200
and I this could be wrong but I don't

626
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,630
think most of the people growing in in

627
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,210
soil are ever going to bring out that

628
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,670
flavor and aroma that my friends in the

629
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,160
hydroponic system are getting because I

630
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,490
feel like some plants like hydro and

631
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,080
some plants like soil and this is a

632
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:38,170
perfect example of phenotypical

633
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:40,359
expression the grower that found this

634
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,550
plant probably grows hydro so he thought

635
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,719
look at this amazing plant that I've got

636
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,579
and then he gave it to all of us soil

637
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,910
growers and we're just frustrated

638
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:51,189
we're so angry so that is my opinion I

639
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,540
think that some strains and I keep

640
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,220
saying all these different words and

641
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,420
they're known as different things in

642
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,039
different circles people will call them

643
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,039
varietals and you'll hear a cultivar

644
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,289
also I'll say strains or clones some

645
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,599
strains or clones or plants are just not

646
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,339
simply going to work in a day and I'm

647
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,709
sure that if you took one of my soil

648
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:11,139
plants and you tried to grow that in a

649
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,940
hydroponic system you may not have as

650
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,830
stellar results as you would have in

651
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,330
soil it's just some plants are going to

652
