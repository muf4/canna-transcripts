the video there's only one camera today

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,199
we are figuring out what the technical

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,640
difficulty is with the other camera

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
pretty soon maybe just purchase another

52
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,118

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,039

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
checking out the comments a little bit

72
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,919
more previously i talked about not

73
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,000
reading those i've been making an effort

74
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,079
to browse them a little bit more

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,479
i do see that you guys prefer the longer

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,280
episodes i prefer the longer episodes

77
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,878
myself i think um even when the camera

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
does crap out the longer episodes are

79
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,840
still more fun

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
it takes a minute to get started i got

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,439
to do the ads i got to do the intro i

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,519

settled in i really like flowing so i do

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200

as well so i will do my best to get

86
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,799
longer episodes coming to you but

87
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,639
sometimes short sweet episodes are good

88
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,760
and good good and good i said that not

89

then their first time they grew they got

166
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,199
their hands on the bog bog bubble since

167
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
then they've been hooked on all things

168
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,120
bubble gum when it comes to cannabis and

169
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
love trying things that are crossed with

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
it that bubble gum terp and that bubble

171
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
gum effect is great uh anything from i'm

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,038
not sure if the bog bubble comes from

173
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,038
the old indiana bubble gum i didn't

174
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
research that but anything from that

175
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,120
indiana bubble gum or true bubble gum

176
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,199
line is tasty it tastes so good it's got

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,038
that super stickiness to it which

178
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
actually is why the bubble gum got its

179
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,639
name it wasn't from the flavors or the

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
aromas it was because it was so sticky

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
that it was sticky like bubble gums

182
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,919
where bubble gum got its name so our

183
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,000
friend is thinking about or talking

184
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,639
about doing some breeding in the future

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,519
uh they're in love with the bog bubble

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,360
and all things bubble gum and bubble gum

187
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,599
crosses now here's where we get into the

188
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
question part it says i do not require a

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,919
large quantity of cannabis and when i do

190
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,879
decide to create some seeds i am purely

191
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,038
looking for that euphoric giggly creeper

192
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,159
uh what's it say creeper high that i

193
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,240
remember from bog my question is what is

194
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
the best way to select keepers in a

195
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,478
breeding project if i'm only looking for

196
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,800
specific effects

197
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,560
um that is a really good question you've

198
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
got a goal so the goal is the most

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
important part it says should i take

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
small samples late in flower or decide

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,280
purely based off the smell of the terps

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,478
neither one of those you're going to

203
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,839
have to

204
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,680
completely finish your test samples

205
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,918
dry them cure them and smoke them and if

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,120
you're looking if you're judging your

207
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,240
phenohunt based purely on looking for

208
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,598
the euphoric giggly creeper buzz you've

209
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,800
got to grow them to full mature maturity

210
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,319
dry them cure them smoke them

211
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
all of these things have to happen under

212
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
the same scientific type conditions i

213
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,598
understand you're in a three by three

214
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,519
tent which actually kind of makes it

215
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,918
better because that three by three tint

216
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,519
is gives you much less variables that's

217
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,000
only three by three you've only got that

218
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,918
much space to have differences so you

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
get your 3x3 i would grow as many seeds

220
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,079
as you can fit in there and as legally i

221
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,599
do them small

222
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,120
grow them until you can get a clone get

223
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,038
your clone then grow them all

224
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
scientifically feed them all the same

225
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,680
thing

226
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,519
treat them all the same way give them

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,439
all the same amount of light air

228
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,439
humidity that's why the 3x3 is cool it's

229
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
very limited your variables are going to

230
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,879
be limited in there

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,079
you've got to grow it

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
harvest them

233
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,120
you can harvest them at different times

234
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,478
wait until you see the trichomes look

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
the way that you would normally harvest

236
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,878
way so you feel like each plant is done

237
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
harvest them dry and cure them the same

238
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,520
way

239
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,799
then smoke them

240
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,120
i've got like

241
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
i noticed that when i smoke if you guys

242
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
watch any of my live shows or if you

243
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,918
know me you know that my office space is

244
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
my favorite little smoking spot i've got

245
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,680
a huge computer screen

246
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
my favorite music is there my drink goes

247
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,918
right here the dab rig is right here

248
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,598
it's just like my home base that is my

249
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,038
spot when i get home and want to chill

250
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,878
out and take some dabs and put on some

251
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,918
music and relax that is the first spot i

252
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,158
go got a nice cozy computer chair uh

253
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,319
chilling out that is like my my test

254
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,319
zone if i was gonna test new dabs new

255
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,800
cannabis that would be the first place i

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,640
would go my favorite smoking devices

257
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,879
there my favorite music is there my

258
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,278
comfortable chair is there my snacks are

259
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,919
within reach i know that that is my zone

260
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,838
i can get i can get wrecked in that zone

261
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,199
and nothing can go wrong if anything

262
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
does go wrong there's a couch on the

263
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
other side of the room that i just i

264
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
just basically crawl to the couch and

265
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,000
everything will be okay i've got snacks

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
i've got drinks i've got a couch i got

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,679
music nothing can go wrong

268
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
so that is my desired test environment

269
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,439
if i had new product to test i would

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
test it all there also i would try to

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
test it all after a decent meal have

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
some food in my stomach have some

273
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,160
hydration not be exhausted not be too

274
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,240
hyper not have any caffeinated beverages

275
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,079
not too much sugar just kind of baseline

276
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
you know belly full to where when you

277
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,959
smoke it you're not going to get instant

278
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,720
munchies you got some blood sugar to

279
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,559
handle something to handle the blood

280
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
sugar then you take a couple of dabs

281
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,399
take a couple smokes whatever however

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,240
you bong rips pipe rips

283
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
get the cannabis india see what it does

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,680
to you give give each sample that same

285
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,600
kind of critical test sample do it in

286
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,519
your favorite device in your favorite

287
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
space have you noticed if you smoke in

288
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
your little your comfort space you can

289
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
smoke and enjoy it really comfortably

290
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,159
you could taste every terp smell every

291
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,159
smell because you don't have to pay

292
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,559
attention to like uh if you're smoking

293
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,639
somewhere perhaps in the car or at

294
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,559
somebody else's house at somebody else's

295
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,639
house maybe the dog is gonna knock over

296
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,799
your drink or spill the bong or you

297
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,480
can't really focus as much on what you

298
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,719
can when you're in your perfect little

299
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,600
bubble that's my opinion so i would say

300
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,519
smoke all of the samples in a scientific

301
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,759
sort of format with the same baseline

302
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,240
sort of starting point full stomach no

303
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,240
sugar no caffeine clear head good mood

304
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
nothing to do and see what it does see

305
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
if that's the one that gives you that

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
giggly uh euphoric creeper bud feeling

307
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
you've got to smoke if what you're

308
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,320
looking for is specifically that effect

309
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
you've got to find the finished product

310
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
that gives you that effect that's the

311
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,278
only way to really test it uh taking

312
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,200
early samples won't tell you what you're

313
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,078
going to have in a final product you've

314
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
got to

315
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,479
smoke a final finished product that is

316
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
my opinion uh if you really want to know

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
what you're going to get so you've got a

318
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,639
goal uh you've got a long long term

319
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,399
short-term goal is to reproduce that

320
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,120
giggly effect do you want to f2 these

321
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,240
things do you want to f3 f4 how far do

322
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,919
you want to go when you're breeding do

323
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
you just want to make a few seeds for

324
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,120
yourself to play with or do you want to

325
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
make a whole bunch of seeds it sounds

326
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,159
like you just want to make some for you

327
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,039
to breed and grow out and hopefully you

328
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,879
find that giggly stuff so it says any

329
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,360
advice would be greatly appreciated keep

330
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,360
doing your thing p.s i'm about to pop

331
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
some strawberry starburst i can't wait

332
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,399
to see what these are

333
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,720
all about cheers from zach dude uh

334
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,360
strawberry starburst and that bog bubble

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,639
would be really great and you will find

336
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
similar bubble gum type terps in the

337
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,838
strawberry starburst their strawberry

338
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,920
candy their strawberry bubble gum

339
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,959
there's a watermelon terp in there

340
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,159
when you if you grow the flowers out and

341
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,879
what i have noticed this is my

342
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,759
experience when you grow the flowers and

343
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,159
press them into concentrate or where

344
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,679
they why yeah grow the flowers wash it

345
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,679
and then press the con the wash

346
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,759
concentrates you grow it make bubble

347
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,078
hash then press the bubble hash

348
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,000
that tasted like strawberry bubble gum

349
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,078
that's what i did notice so you may get

350
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
some strawberry terps bubble gummy terps

351
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,399
out of that

352
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,120
no um do you have an idea when you breed

353
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,519
with the bog are you going to use a

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,919
bubble a bog bubble mail or are you

355
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,240
going to use a bog bubble female what do

356
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,919
you have in mind here i would grow

357
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,278
i would try to use that bog i would

358
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,958
almost just make f2s if you're just

359
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,000
doing this just for fun for your own

360
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,719
personal enjoyment i would make f2s i

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,200
would find the bog mail that looks and

362
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
smells a lot like the bog female you're

363
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
going to find find that perfect so

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
you're going to grow a pack of the bog

365
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,360
girls hopefully you can get more of

366
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,879
those seeds right that would be ideal

367
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,039
here or hopefully you've got a clone or

368
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,360
something of the female anyway try to

369
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,439
find some of that bog bubble grow that

370
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
find a female that gives you the traits

371
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
you're looking for you're going to find

372
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,599
one in there it was in the pack the

373
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,759
first time that you grew it you'll find

374
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
it in the pack again so find that

375
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,679
phenotype that gives you the giggles the

376
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,120
creeper uh what else is the effect right

377
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,120
there that you're looking for giggles

378
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
creeper there's something else but the

379
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
my printer kind of messed up around this

380
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,000
euphoric is the other word uh so find

381
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,078
those traits from the female now you've

382
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
got a male find a male that looks

383
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,439
similar to that you're going to be

384
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,278
limited on male selection find the best

385
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
male out of the pack that's going to be

386
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,120
up to you find the one that looks a lot

387
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,039
like the girl you're working with now

388
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,039
you've got a male and you've got a girl

389
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,360
ah now i would also find a couple of

390
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,519
other female plants to put in that room

391
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,800
something like the strawberry starburst

392
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,679
would be cool but then i would find

393
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,879
something

394
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,838
vastly different than the bog just way

395
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,600
different

396
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,839
just to play with just to see what that

397
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,959
bog is what the bog bubble is

398
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,440
contributing to the mix uh breed it to

399
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,359
um something really cushy or gassy or

400
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,200
garlicky so that you can see what it

401
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
contributes does it give it uh does it

402
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,879
change the structure does it change the

403
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,319
aroma does it change the uh does it give

404
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,559
you just a bunch of mutants does it make

405
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,800
it really resistant to bugs see what

406
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,239
that male is adding by breeding it to

407
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,159
other plants now of course you've got to

408
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
grow those but that is the best the

409
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,078
funnest part grow maybe i don't know

410
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,518
that is a big debate in my head right

411
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,838
now i want your feedback send me an

412
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,879
email hit me up on twitter however you

413
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,120
know how to get in touch with me on

414
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,000
twitter it's at gfyh podcast i want to

415
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
know do you enjoy the phenohunt and

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
growing more or do you enjoy smoking it

417
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
more i really love growing it and seeing

418
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,919
what happens to the flowers like i made

419
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
the seed so after you make a breeding

420
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,159
project this is my question if you do a

421
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,000
breeding project and you make seeds are

422
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,078
you more excited about seeing what the

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,799
plants do as they grow or smoking the

424
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,958
final product as a breeder i'm torn that

425
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,399
is a really uh that's a really big

426
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,399
question for me

427
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,519
so i lost my place rambling on that one

428
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,639
but i would find that uh yeah then you

429
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,720
get to grow them then you get to smoke

430
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,320
them out find a male find a female then

431
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
find a couple of other females and put

432
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,278
them in the room because that dude's

433
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
going to be in there skeet skeeting

434
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,240
blowing pollen anyway so just put a

435
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
couple of females in there for him to

436
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,759
pollinate make it a party get a bunch of

437
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,920
different seeds keep all of those seeds

438
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,600
separate when you harvest uh then grow

439
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,078
them out mark them so that you know this

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
is like a strawberry starburst to the

441
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,679
bog and then this is the whatever to the

442
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
bog and this to the bog markham grow

443
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,359
them see what you've got and then like i

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,079
said identify the trait that that male

445
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,600
is delivering to the mix see if he's uh

446
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,599
if the bog f2s come out bubble gummy and

447
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
euphoric and giggly perfect you hit your

448
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
goal right there but to the strawberry

449
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,039
starburst what did you get did it make

450
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,719
the strawberry starburst to go super

451
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,319
tall did it make it short and squat did

452
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
it make it get a sour

453
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
maybe a grapefruit kind of an aroma when

454
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,039
you hit it to an indica or a garlic

455
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,039
plant does the garlic come out more or

456
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,639
does the structure of the original plant

457
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,240
you pollinated come out or does the

458
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
structure of that male plant come out a

459
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
little bit more you should be able to

460
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
identify the traits

461
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,919
when you do the breeding to see which

462
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,919
side which parent came out you should be

463
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,679
able to see that so i would take the boy

464
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,439
i would take the girl uh take a few

465
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,439
other girls and have a party in there

466
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,000
grow them now the most important part

467
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
again is to finish them let them finish

468
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
i don't know why i stuttered so strong

469
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,720
when i said that but i must have meant

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,278
it let them finish then harvest them dry

471
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
them cure them just like you normally do

472
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,639
just like you do all of your other crops

473
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,319
don't do anything do it scientifically

474
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
but don't dry them and cure them don't

475
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
do anything weird no anomalies do what

476
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,799
you know don't do any new experiments

477
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,799
like i tried this because that may [ __ ]

478
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,799
up all of your science if you try one

479
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,879
new thing that can mess everything up do

480
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,039
the familiar [ __ ] that you do but keep

481
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,519
it very regulated amongst every plant in

482
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,519
the grow dry them cure them smoke them

483
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,198
see what you enjoy the best those are

484
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
your keepers if you are breeding for

485
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,399
potency and effect that is the way to

486
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,078
find the keepers but also keep in mind

487
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
that if you're growing this you're going

488
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,239
to want plants that grow well um

489
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,000
structure is important is it shaped well

490
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,879
does that plant support itself does it

491
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,879
grow in your growing style i don't know

492
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,559
if you grow in three you're in a three

493
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,559
by three tent so you're not in gigantic

494
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,159
pots but i don't know if you grow hydro

495
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
do you grow soilless mix do you grow

496
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,278
cocoa do you grow in a six inch net pot

497
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,278
or a three gallon pot do you grow

498
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,278
one big bud and cut off all the branches

499
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,000
do you trellis them out real far do you

500
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,519
use a tomato cage do you use a stick are

501
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,198
using yoyos and hanging them from the

502
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,278
ceiling yes that is a thing it's not as

503
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,039
crazy as it sounds it sounds different

504
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,958
than what it looks like if you're not

505
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,159
familiar with the yoyos but how are you

506
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,758
growing i don't know how you're growing

507
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,240
in there so find the phenotype that is

508
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,400
going to work the best for you also your

509
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
environment is it hot is it cold you may

510
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,360
need to find the phenotype that works

511
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,679
best for the hot for the cold for the

512
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,599
humid for the dry uh do you want the one

513
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,280
that takes a little bit longer to flower

514
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,038
are you patient can you handle that are

515
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,720
you freaking out are you like ah this

516
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,318
plant needs to get done already or are

517
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
you like man i got all day that's cool

518
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
at that plant [ __ ] finch i'm patient

519
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,838
i love letting plants grow for a long

520
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,679
time so do you want the faster finisher

521
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,279
do you want the longer finisher there

522
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,759
are so many variables to think about

523
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,359
what about bug resistance uh do you want

524
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,440
these plants to be really resistant to

525
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,519
bugs or does that even matter to you do

526
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,360
you care if they are resistant to mold

527
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,558
and mildew or do you not even care

528
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,798
because you're the only one growing

529
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,879
those i make seeds for market i make

530
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,319
seeds uh first of all i make a lot of

531
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
seeds for myself you guys see these

532
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,119
strains pop up occasionally you're like

533
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,519
where did those come from why were those

534
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,839
never for sale like the garlic goat was

535
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,359
made just for me to play with and then i

536
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,879
made so many of those that i was like

537
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,558
i'm never gonna grow all these so i put

538
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
some of them out let some people get

539
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,558
their hands on those but if you're just

540
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,240
making them for you you could breed for

541
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,200
just potency just for flavor i'm

542
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,519
breeding for things that go to the

543
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,480
market they've got to be pest resistant

544
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,160
pathogen resistant definitely no mutants

545
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,599
no intersex plants i've got to be very

546
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,080
careful what i put out but when i'm

547
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,599
making stuff for me i could just be it

548
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,759
could be really problematic and i can

549
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,119
find the keeper for myself to grow and

550
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,160
that's more fun so it depends on what

551
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,399
you're going to do with it it sounds

552
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
like these are just for you now

553
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,640
you've got that three by three you don't

554
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,320
have to grow gigantic plants if you find

555
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
uh this is something i was talking about

556
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,359
with a couple of friends people like i

557
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,119
just don't have room to breathe i don't

558
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,599
have the space i wish i had room to grow

559
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,119
and breed you can breed in a very small

560
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,359
space your three by three would be

561
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,759
beautiful i keep saying put that male

562
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,678
plant and several females in there you

563
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,519
can pollinate in a three by three you

564
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,919
could probably hypothetically put you i

565
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
can fit nine uh three gallon pots and

566
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
they're easily in a three by three they

567
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,119
may be the pots may be touching might

568
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,759
not be a lot of space but i'm thinking

569
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,759
uh nine three rows of three three gallon

570
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,879
pots put the dude in the middle surround

571
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,400
him with ladies when he starts

572
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
pollinating all those girls are gonna

573
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
get it

574
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,599
that's probably what i would do that's

575
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,199
uh eight female plants in there that you

576
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,279
get to pollinate you know you don't have

577
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,080
to grow them very big if you want to go

578
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,759
even quicker and not make a big mess and

579
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,879
get a bunch of pollen and have a huge

580
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,038
project you can breed in small pots i've

581
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,640
done beer cup breeding projects i

582
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,319
shouldn't tell everybody about this as a

583
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,320
seed maker i shouldn't tell you how to

584
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,798
make seeds so quickly so easily but this

585
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,038
is a very easy effective way to make a

586
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,200
few seeds just for yourself to play with

587
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,720
when i make seeds the first time i make

588
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,038
a cross let's say that we're going to

589
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,360
make let's pick a strain let's say jack

590
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,079
tripper this is a real thing that has

591
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:43,119
happened jack tripper jack tripper is

592
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,558
lemon skunk to jack the ripper uh come

593
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,079
and dance on our floor the song will be

594
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,160
stuck in your head all day you're gonna

595
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,678
be coming knock on our door now it's in

596
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,440
your head it'll never stop that's where

597
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
jack tripper came from on the story when

598
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,679
the question gets asked jack tripper

599
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,199
lemon skunk jack the ripper call it jack

600
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
tripper uh

601
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,480
amazing lemon terps lemon cleaner terps

602
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,480
uh almost gross overpowering lemon

603
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,919
cleaner terps and the head buzz it's

604
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,279
like a knife just came through the

605
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,200
ceiling and ripped your head off and

606
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,480
opened your brain in half and lights and

607
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,038
fireworks just come out of your brain

608
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,079
for a minute the head high is so extreme

609
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,519
but anyway let me focus um jack tripper

610
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,558
i only made

611
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,519
70 50 something seeds of that maybe just

612
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,279
a small a small drug bag of seeds that's

613
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,720
how many seeds i made you know what i'm

614
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,558
talking about a little drug bag that's

615
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
how many seeds i made

616
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,038
not a lot because i don't know i didn't

617
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,480
know i do know now at the time i didn't

618
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,038
know if that was going to be

619
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
uh completely intersex plants complete

620
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,720
mutants i didn't know if they were going

621
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
to take 74 weeks to flower i didn't know

622
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,839
if they were going to be duds i didn't

623
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,279
know what it was going to do so instead

624
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,678
of wasting time uh vegging a plant that

625
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,678
is going to get real big first of all a

626
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,159
male plant that gets real big makes a

627
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,759
lot of pollen pollen goes everywhere and

628
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
not that i'm lazy but i don't want to

629
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,599
clean up a whole bunch of pollen if i

630
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,440
don't have to if there's minimal pollen

631
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,918
that is less to clean so i grew a

632
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
smaller male plant uh he was in a six

633
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
inch net pot because i wanted him kind

634
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,080
of bigger than the females because i

635
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,839
want enough pollen to get the room there

636
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,839
so i got my male and a six inch net pot

637
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,678
i got my females and beer cups i can

638
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,959
pollinate a bunch of beer cups you grow

639
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,798
them to where they're

640
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,159
just big enough to i don't know four or

641
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,400
five inches maybe three and a half

642
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,400
inches flip them by the time the pollen

643
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
hits they're only maybe eight inches ten

644
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,240
inches tall by the time they're done

645
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,079
they're 10 or they're 12 maybe 14 inches

646
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
tall you may need to put a skinny stick

647
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,199
in there just to support them but from

648
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,720
that plant you're going to get a lot of

649
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,720
seeds a lot a lot of seeds a lot like 30

650
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
to 70 seeds probably and that's plenty

651
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,038
for just a home grower a home breeder to

652
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
tinker and play with you guys buy a 10

653
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
pack and you spend good money on a 10

654
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,720
pack if you get 30 seeds and you do that

655
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
to four or five plants you're going to

656
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,038
get at least 100 150 200 and something

657
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,279
seeds to play with and you can do that

658
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,519
in one very small run if you've got a

659
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,079
small just a very tiny space that you

660
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,918
can control the light to 12 12 for six

661
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,519
weeks nine weeks on

662
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,120
there are some variables in there i said

663
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,279
six weeks because you can put the light

664
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,558
back uh to a vegetative cycle and the

665
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,279
seeds will finish you don't have any

666
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,879
problem with that but um six to nine

667
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,720
weeks that you can control a flowering

668
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,159
cycle three or four two or three three

669
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,159
or four weeks you can control a veg

670
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,559
phase you can produce seeds uh that will

671
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,640
be very viable usable for yourself so i

672
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,158
got rambly on that one uh but you don't

673
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,240
need as much space as you think you

674
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,919
might need is what i'm saying you can

675
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,759
pollinate little tiny plants they don't

676
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,759
have to be super large get them in a

677
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,079
beer cup veg them until they're as tall

678
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,119
as gi joe flower them they'll end up two

679
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,720
or three gi joes tall they'll have 30 50

680
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,639
maybe even 100 seeds in there depending

681
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
on the strain some of the og kush stuff

682
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
doesn't make a lot of big buds you don't

683
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,760
get a lot of seeds out of that the mac

684
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
doesn't take pollen the mac is just

685
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,558
stingy

686
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,759
don't be stingy mac

687
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,599
but then things like strawberry

688
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,640
starburst they'll take a lot of pollen

689
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,959
and give you a lot of seeds blue

690
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,120
raspberry truffle blueberry cookies

691
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,798
they make a lot of pistols they make a

692
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,558
lot of seeds when you pollinate them the

693
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,798
jack the ripper crosses

694
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,720
make a lot of pistols very early and

695
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,879
produce a lot of seed so you can hit

696
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,319
those really early when they're little

697
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,760
and produce seeds for yourself to play

698
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,279
with all right i got rambling let me

699
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,558
check my notes there are more notes on

700
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,839
this page

701
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,399
if you're looking for the effects you

702
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,158
definitely have to smoke it um gotta

703
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
find the the potency that you're looking

704
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,919
for there's no other way to tell now

705
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,319
here is the last note that i did right

706
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,759
on this page it says if you find the

707
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,678
right keeper and the one that gives you

708
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,879
that giggly buzz and that euphoric high

709
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,159
and that creeper effect that you're

710
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,600
looking for is it necessary to do any

711
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
breeding you've already got the plant

712
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,199
that you're looking for it's perfect uh

713
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,359
you could you could just be happy with

714
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
that i understand the desire the need

715
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,839
the want uh just the excitement of

716
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,319
breeding but honestly if you've got the

717
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,678
plant that does what you need it to do

718
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,119
you don't you don't really have to go

719
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,038
any further you could just clone it and

720
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,278
grow it forever and ever and be

721
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,960
completely happy with that you could or

722
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,558
you can s want it you could self it and

723
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,519
make more seeds of it than you've got

724
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,000
those seeds forever uh here's another

725
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,319
avenue um if you don't have a male plant

726
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
if you don't have any seeds if you do uh

727
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,480
of the bog if you do have the clone of

728
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,039
the bog you can reverse it and you can

729
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,120
use that as your pollen donor and that

730
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,038
can pollinate another clone of the bog

731
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,639
you can make s-ones of that and while

732
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,119
you're doing that you can also put that

733
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,520
pollen on other female plants and

734
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,199
outcross it those would be ours from the

735
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,200
previous episodes self and reverse

736
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,759
plants you can make some selves and some

737
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
reversals using the bog keeper i don't

738
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,759
know if you still have it let me try to

739
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
read again i always wanted to breed

740
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,599
years ago buddy grew for the first time

741
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,278
got our hands on bog since then i've

742
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,038
looked uh i've loved all things bubble

743
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,720
so i don't know if you still have it um

744
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,038
if you've still got it you can self it

745
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,558
and then you can make a self cross of it

746
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,240
and you can outcross it if you still

747
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,678
have it if not

748
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,519
i would recommend trying to find another

749
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,038
pack if not you said you're growing the

750
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,200
strawberry starburst you're gonna find

751
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,759
similar bubble gummy terps in there

752
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,960
you'll find creeper you'll find euphoric

753
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,558
the answer may lie in that pack all

754
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,079
right my friend zach i do want to thank

755
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,678
you for the great message you did get me

756
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,359
rambling i do appreciate that i like

757
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
talking about breeding i like looping it

758
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,000
back to previous episodes that was a

759
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,519
good chat thank you once again the email

760
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,599
address is grow from your heart at

761
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,879
hotmail.com don't be shy send me those

762
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,558
questions

763
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,240
i do have one more quick question i'm

764
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,798
going to cover here in this episode this

765
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,720
one comes from our friend kyle what up

766
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,440
kyle thank you for the great question

767
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,679
this one goes a lot like this it says

768
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,080
hey ross to jeff i have a question about

769
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,720
ph this is a good question it says i

770
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,399
know you recommend to be in the 6.2 to

771
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
6.5 range i usually would say six two to

772
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,640
six point four but six five in like a

773
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
soilless mix and stuff yeah that'll work

774
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,759
for you i said i completely understand

775
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,600
the reasoning but i'm curious why canada

776
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,200
recommend canada is a nutrient brand by

777
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,639
the way it says i'm curious why kano

778
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,200
recommends as low as 5.5 so canna is a

779
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,360
nutrient company they sell bottled

780
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
nutrients and on their website most of

781
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,759
the nutrient brands that you buy do have

782
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,839
a website with a nutrient calculator a

783
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,319
nutrient feed chart on there a nutrient

784
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,079
nutrient schedule uh nutrients is

785
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,439
starting to become the new roads in my

786
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,199
head if you know what i'm talking about

787
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,159
big up shout out to chris farley um

788
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,519
nutrients anyway uh so they're a

789
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
nutrient company they sell bottled

790
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,240
nutrients and they do recommend as low

791
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,480
as 5.5 that does make sense i did check

792
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,038
their website let's talk minimally about

793
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,519
ph because i am not an organic chemistry

794
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,759
expert our plants are uptaking uh

795
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,119
buffered nutrients in a bottled nutrient

796
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,679
environment they're taking up bottled

797
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,158
nutrients they're taking up uh the 16

798
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,880
elements nitrogen phosphorus potassium

799
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,039
mellitum malebinim wow you say that one

800
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
fast calcium magnesium there are more

801
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,519
than i'm going to miss but i'm going to

802
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,440
try to keep on moving our plants are

803
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,679
trying to uptake those things

804
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,679
for those things to be bioavailable to

805
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,960
our plant the ph

806
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:57,440
needs to be the ph of that feed solution

807
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,079
needs to be around 6.2 to 6.5 those

808
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,240
nutrients are more bioavailable to the

809
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,839
plant at that range once it gets higher

810
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
the plant doesn't uptake that once it

811
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,319
gets lower the plant doesn't uptake that

812
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,720
the reason we recommend a six two to six

813
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,240
five is because there's kind of a range

814
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
where like some of the nutrients would

815
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,759
kind of take up better at six five some

816
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,679
of them would kind of take up better at

817
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,679
six two so we go right in the middle to

818
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,360
where you get just just kind of the best

819
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
for both of those nutrients and we're

820
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
using so many things that we just found

821
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,440
that within that six two to six four six

822
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,120
five range you do get a good window

823
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,558
where most things will absorb with uh mo

824
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,079
they'll work best together i don't know

825
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,000
the scientific terms like i said i'm not

826
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,000
an organic chemistry major

827
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,640
but that's where things seem to work the

828
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,278
best now the reason uh that they are

829
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,559
giving you such a broad range in this

830
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,640
proprietary brand uh i did yeah and the

831
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,119
rest of the question says uh recommends

832
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,080
5.5 i do believe they say the highest is

833
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,239
6.2 is this something proprietary to

834
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,398
them yes this is proprietary to them i

835
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,720
did some research on their website

836
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:06,639
the 5.2 is recommended for hydro for

837
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:11,278
dirt they recommend a 5.8 to 6.2 and for

838
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,480
cocoa they recommend 5.5 to 6.2 so in

839
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,398
the hydro

840
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,798
there's nothing buffering those

841
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,959
nutrients uh from touching the roots so

842
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,720
they give you just a little bit lower ph

843
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
that's just straight to the nutrient

844
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
straight absorption absorption so the

845
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,639
lower ph works there's no soil to buffer

846
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,798
there there's nothing to work through

847
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,240
nothing in the way straight to the roots

848
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,038
that makes sense they'll be quickly

849
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,798
absorbable at that low of a ph i

850
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,038
honestly am not super experienced in

851
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,679
hydro but it does kind of make sense for

852
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,158
the little bit i know about uh plant

853
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,640
growing organic chemistry and ph i do

854
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,559
think that makes sense now the 5 8 6 2

855
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,038
in the dirt is because of the buffering

856
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,960
of the dirt the soil the dirt there does

857
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,038
give you a little bit to work with it

858
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,880
does make that range a little bit more

859
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,558
available for the plants it's kind of i

860
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,799
keep saying the word buffering you just

861
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,798
get a little more room uh to work with

862
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,480
that's why that's why we recommend soil

863
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,398
and soilless mix to new growers because

864
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
it is a little bit easier to work with

865
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,719
that soil kind of works the soil kind of

866
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,398
corrects your problems a little bit to

867
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
an extent don't think you can just go

868
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,000
pouring in a bunch of [ __ ] but it does

869
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
kind of help you correct the problems at

870
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,319
that point you fed the soil the soil

871
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
will do some work the living [ __ ] inside

872
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,240
the soil will do its things and help uh

873
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,079
correct what you've done a little bit

874
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
and make that available to the plants

875
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,599
again i'm gonna get a lot of messages

876
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,119
about what i just said i am not an

877
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,719
organic chemistry major i'm trying to

878
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,319
explain this the best i know how

879
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,880
somebody said i explained things like

880
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,319
people have never grown before uh good a

881
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
lot of people never have grown before

882
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,319
and that's why they're here

883
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,798
uh let me keep going then it says uh 5.5

884
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,240
to 6.2 in cocoa uh yeah we're getting

885
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,000
that low 5.5 in cocoa because uh that is

886
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,759
very close to hydra that is kind of a

887
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,839
hybrid of soilless mix uh hydro together

888
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,759
so that's why you can go so low in there

889
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,839
basically nothing buffering uh

890
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,679
protecting the roots just cocoa in there

891
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,720
that's basically hydro the cocoa is

892
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,798
basically inert also we could talk about

893
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,519
i wrote down phase

894
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,119
and medium and plant specific in certain

895
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,798
phases your plants are going to want

896
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,639
different phs

897
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,879
in different medium your plant may want

898
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,038
different phs um

899
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,440
and also it's plant-specific i know that

900
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,200
some of the cookies crosses like a lower

901
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
ph some of the more sativa dominant

902
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,159
stuff likes a higher ph sometimes uh if

903
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,839
you're in certain environments you want

904
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,799
to adjust ph to kind of compensate for

905
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,558
some things that may help you out so um

906
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,839
that is why they're recommending a range

907
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,359
let me get back onto the question get

908
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,359
back in track here

909
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,119
all right it goes on to say this run i

910
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,278
followed your range and i feel like my

911
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,918
plants are very happy i have your

912
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,440
testers hitting my flower tent next and

913
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
i wanted to get your thoughts i'm

914
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,919
excited to see your testers it sounds

915
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,880
like you're going to pay a lot of good

916
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,960
attention to them it says as a side note

917
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,360
uh for this typically when i mix my

918
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,919
nutrients it hits about six three until

919
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,079
i bump up the feed and mid flour uh then

920
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,480
it consistently sits at five eight until

921
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,158
i adjust uh that's gonna you could

922
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,319
probably feed them that 5 8 and they

923
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,320
wouldn't be angry but if you're liking

924
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,158
what you're seeing i wouldn't change

925
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,079
anything a lot of people want to make

926
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,760
changes because of numbers and [ __ ]

927
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,519
watch the plants the plants are the boss

928
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,038
if you're liking the results

929
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,399
don't change anything it goes on to say

930
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,158
thanks for all you do

931
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,239
you have helped me improve my grow by

932
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,559
leaps and bounds i can't thank you

933
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,919
enough your friend kyle that means a lot

934
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,398
to me knowing that i have improved your

935
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,399
grow leaps and bounds that makes it all

936
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,479
worth it like i said uh those kind of

937
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,639
compliments that type of feedback makes

938
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,079
setting up a camera uh makes having a

939
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,278
frustrating camera that keeps turning

940
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,639
off on me and draining a battery and

941
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,398
doing weird [ __ ]

942
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,840
these comments this type of feedback

943
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,599
makes all that [ __ ] worth it sometimes

944
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,439
that camera makes me want to throw it

945
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,639
i'm not even mad at that camera anymore

946
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,558
doesn't even bug me that i got these

947
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,559
bright ass lights in my face i love the

948
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,158
feedback thank you guys i love knowing

949
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,278
that i'm making your garden better i

950
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,120
love knowing that i'm making your

951
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,599
growing experience better growing should

952
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,158
be fun growing should be pleasurable

953
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,079
growing is like my zen zone i do work in

954
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,919
a commercial environment i do consulting

955
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,398
i do get paid for that sort of stuff

956
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,640
when i'm in my own personal grow i close

957
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,759
the door i put in the earbuds sometimes

958
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,278
i'm just listening to the growth

959
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,359
sometimes i just hear the fans and the

960
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,159
blowers and i love it it's relaxing the

961
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,079
the sound of a vortex fan or a hurricane

962
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,120
fan and then just another oscillating

963
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,119
fan coming by that

964
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,120
and then

965
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,000
ah those sounds it's like what is it

966
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,479
asmr amsr i don't know the right order

967
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but it's like music to my ears sometimes

968
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,440
hearing those [ __ ] sounds in the grow

969
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
space and then you hear the air

970
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,480
conditioner kick on that

971
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,038
that's a pretty good imitation of the

972
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,038
air conditioner that'll run for a few

973
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,319
