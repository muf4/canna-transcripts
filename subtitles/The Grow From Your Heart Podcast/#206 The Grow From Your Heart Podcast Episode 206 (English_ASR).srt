[Music]

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:32,549
[Music]

48
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:34,619
pretty much anything under a thing it's

49
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,150
a depressant it is a depressant it

50
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,769
doesn't help me much you know I quit

51
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,400
drinking when I got my medical marijuana

52
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,049
card and my wife is easier happier when

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,480
I wake up I know where my money is I

54
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,599
know where my car is parked I appreciate

55
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,789
it I still drink occasionally like I'll

56
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,419
have a dough sekiz but for the most part

57
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:56,158
I quit like five or six years back just

58
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,369
cuz I got really good at throwing up in

59
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,370
bars

60
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,730
it was the Celtic in downtown Denver

61
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:19,530
thinking like yeah man we didn't get any

62
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:22,079
on you you're pro like 25 and all my

63
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,799
social life revolves around the bars and

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:31,410
the bar scene and it was a little while

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,360
but now it's just a big role yeah once I

66
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,800
moved away from my party town it was a

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,060
lot easier for me to quit drinking I

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,310
lived in Lawrence Kansas for a little

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,709
while and it's just really easy to be a

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,728
sponge in there then I came here where

71
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,680
there's a lot of drinking and I know

72
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:45,209
everybody so that sucked me in a little

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,819
bit but once I realized what I was doing

74
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:50,638
I just gave it up I can smoke all the

75
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,709
weed I can handle I took a gram dad last

76
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,478
night like why would I even need alcohol

77
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,829
in my life at all he's gonna do another

78
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,359
one's a night so I'm gonna do it again

79
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,339
tonight I filmed myself taking a gram

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,020
dad last night and the video was very

81
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,359
disappointing I put the dab on the

82
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,038
dabber kind of wonky and it just it

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,860
wasn't that was not an impressive video

84
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,120
it's gonna be a fun video if we could

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,759
have like the count from Sesame Street

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,379
[Music]

87
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,848
several inhales and exhales to get that

88
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,139
dab just partially because the way I

89
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:22,139
dropped it on the nail I didn't time it

90
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,860
right it was my breath and dab right get

91
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,900
the now using a teeny rig I'm gonna

92
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,528
practice big dab on a teeny rig dude

93
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,388
there's something about it

94
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:33,399

gonna talk about Joey Diaz before I got

108
00:05:57,548 --> 00:06:01,198
done this a really huge sidetrack but in

109
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,069
[Music]

110
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:12,728
good that was I've seen a lot of

111
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:15,459
comedians and Anthony Jeselnik was one

112
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:17,468
of my favorites but every second of his

113
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,449
act from the time he walks out to the

114
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:21,939
time he says thank you every second that

115
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,129
is calculated yeah I can see him

116
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,129
counting between jokes I can see his

117
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:29,289
mouth going 1 2 3 and he counts to 11

118
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:32,349
and then he tells another joke really

119
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,668
yeah and so there's that style you know

120
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,860
what I mean he comes out and that's like

121
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:37,658
if that was a bad who would I compared

122
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,860
that to that's like rush every note is

123
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,629
they know what they're doing tonight

124
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,229
every single note all the way through

125
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:45,789
Jeselnik did that Joey Diaz came out and

126
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:48,519
kind of had an idea what he was gonna

127
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:51,368
say and just leveled us just being

128
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,559
himself good most of that maybe he's

129
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,299
told those bits two or three times one

130
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:58,239
of the bits he told I swear I heard him

131
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:59,878
make up on accident on the podcast just

132
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:02,558
a few days before he flew to Colorado

133
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,239
yeah he's a [ __ ] pro and he took that

134
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,829
like something like just right now we'd

135
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:07,388
be saying something and he'd be like oh

136
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,549

137

145
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,139

147
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,429

148
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:32,180
on the edge of my seat the whole time I

149
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:34,129

00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,739
a legend and I you know I don't get

228

early to the meeting I had signed up to

349
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,279

350
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:19,240
I can't see the doors that people walk

351
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,750
in from but I can see the city staff and

352
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,340
the City Council real well and they're

353
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,759
kind of milling around waiting for the

354
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,610
meeting to start and their decorum all

355

356
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,590

357
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,670

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,889
me dude

370
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:13,448
I could feel one guy's eyes cooking a

371
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,089
hole through my shirt and reading my

372
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:18,128
soul like I was like I like looked at

373
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,699
him and nodded like huh I'm not sure why

374
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:23,920
you're standing in my translucent has he

375
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:25,539
seen a ghost and so like people start

376
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,740
speaking and I go I look at them while

377
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,998
they speak right and then I get the

378
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,379
creepy feeling again and I look to my

379
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,149
left and that dude is like this at me

380
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:36,850
and for the listeners it's an intense

381
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:46,899
stare but like this yeah and I never met

382
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:49,050
the man there's another guy who fits the

383
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,578
exact description of rich white guys

384
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,139
like rich white councilmen he's who

385
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:56,799
you'd think of if I saw him I go yes

386
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,629
City Council guy run some [ __ ] city

387
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,958
manager looked at him he goes who's the

388
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:04,120
guy in the Hat I saw him say it like he

389
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,990
didn't care that I was watching him it

390
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,158
was kind of awkward

391
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,349
that was funny through the whole meeting

392
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,390
he kept staring at my little group of

393
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,578
people so in a city council meeting they

394
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,110
do they have a little structure they

395
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,328
have their agenda meeting right at the

396
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,408
beginning and then they have like a

397
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:21,519
little they save the Pledge of

398
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:23,470
Allegiance and they pray and then they

399
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,148
open up the floor and they say they do

400
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,278
public comment and then right after that

401
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:28,778
they say thank you or they do City

402
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,669
contributions or something they called

403
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:32,380
it they call it public forum where

404
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,759
anyone from the public can speak for

405
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,528
five minutes and then they have council

406
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,879
commentary right after that where any of

407
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,409
the council members there was a part

408
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,580
right before that where the lady goes

409
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,140
this is the part where we would normally

410
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:43,000
say thanks to the people that have

411
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,919
contributed to the community last week

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,808
we did a hundred and one luckily there

413
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,090
are none this week my little group

414
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:52,710
chuckle be can I go huh no shoutouts on

415
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,709
the episode this week was what I said

416
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,890
like Mike said after that they let each

417
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,269
council member speak so the first

418
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,740
council member speaks and he's like so

419
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,480
first off I want to say thanks to this

420
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,250
person in this person and I chuckled a

421
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,630
little bit I was like huh and the next

422
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,059
one is like I want to say thanks to this

423
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,160
person so five people in a row go and

424
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,470
they all basically did shoutouts and by

425
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,360
the fourth one I giggled I giggled out

426
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,430
loud and the girl next to me

427
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,229
Angela giggled and then Adam leaned over

428
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,210
and giggle then we were all just like

429
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,579
Church giggling and Angela had the balls

430
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,410
to say it she goes shoutouts and we just

431
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,689
couldn't even handle ourselves anymore

432
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,310
it was so funny

433
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,529
wasn't at this meeting but her little

434
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,970
council commentary for the most of the

435
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:35,680
meetings is its blander than any

436
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,539
advertising you ever heard it's just

437
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,730
it's almost a bulletin board reading

438
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,230
session for a bunch of random local

439
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,660
events I mean her shoutouts are always

440
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,460
come to the Pinewood Derby or come down

441
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,960
to this softball game next week or we're

442
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,630
doing an Eastside Park clean up like

443
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,950
super duper simple shoutouts it's kind

444
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,390
of fun to watch every week the City

445
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,830
Council does some shoutouts brother

446
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,570
there's like 20 minutes of solid like

447
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:57,460
and big shout out to anyone one person

448
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:05,230
goes and also thanks to make it Parks

449
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:08,710
and Rec and it was hilarious hilarious

450
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,690
if you dare watch it's it's a play like

451
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,000
anything you would buy tickets to see

452
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,650
it's just about stuff that's usually

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,670
really this may get me in trouble but

454
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,620
it's really funny I should say this you

455
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,710
have to address the president of City

456
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:33,939
Council as madam president you don't

457
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:54,700
have to send a very condescending tone

458
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:56,410
of them were like yes $5.00 per episode

459
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,569
I promised it's gonna happen I love it

460
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,900
they have to they have to come after a

461
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:03,490
trees green remedies gets a refill but

462
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:08,019
there's been quite a bit of controversy

463
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,849
in like I don't know friction I suppose

464
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,230
you'd call it between the City Council

465
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,759
and city staff and members of City

466
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,710
Council dude a couple of months ago the

467
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,079
council commentary thing was like the

468
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:20,590
Politis book you know [ __ ] you you have

469
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:22,720
ever heard of the City Council man was

470
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,799
in the paper saying stuff two or three

471
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,380
of the other ones was doing was illegal

472
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:29,799
and he kept using the phrase shadow

473
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,780
government and like they were ready like

474
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:40,389
I seriously was waiting for him to rise

475
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:42,039
up with ice picks where I could hear the

476
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,200
whole production crew - that was really

477
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,539
privileged being a nerd like 11 tech

478
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,920
gear I was loving it oh yeah all the

479
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,940
sound equipment I could hear the camera

480
00:20:47,920 --> 00:21:01,360
crew behind me it was awesome there in

481
00:20:50,940 --> 00:21:03,970
five four three we're live I posted a

482
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,259
picture on Instagram of myself that was

483
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,089
on the knives on the news and someone's

484
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:10,480
like dude you look paranoid actually

485
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:12,879
that facial expression was when the city

486
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,779
council president announced her

487
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,780
resignation that's the face I was taken

488
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,659
[Music]

489
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,949
[Music]

490
00:21:33,720 --> 00:22:02,200
up in the council meeting you've got the

491
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,450
college education you got the good

492
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,890
vocabulary I've got the dreadlocks and

493
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,670
the beard they don't want to talk to me

494
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,050
they they stare me down just sitting in

495
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,160
council if I walked up there then well

496
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,359
you got five minutes and they would've

497
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,850
pulled out their phones and it started

498
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,289
tweeting I think and if I went up there

499
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:19,339
they'd be like we're not gonna let the

500
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:22,369
guy with the felony come a little closer

501
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:24,709
please yeah so City Council meeting Mike

502
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:29,809
went and spoke against the proposed

503
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,890
ordinance that was coming up we you want

504
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,769
to tell us how that went so that I don't

505
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:36,110
have to fumble through it fumble um the

506
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,980
proposed ordinance is still sitting at

507
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:42,799
the planning zoning level they are

508
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,410
what's called a recommending body they

509
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,129
suggest things to the City Council and

510
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:52,190
the City Council can run with that idea

511
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,370
or have them amend that idea in some way

512
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,259
or they can kill it altogether usually

513
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,089
city council tells Planning and Zoning

514
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,440
like hey we'd like to see this and then

515
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:02,899
they go work on that it's my

516
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,730
understanding that this is not that kind

517
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,380
of ordinance this is something Planning

518
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,769
and Zoning has been working on is their

519
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,420
own effort to sort of show City Council

520
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:15,200
as a way to solve some of the complaints

521
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,820
they've been receiving essentially

522
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,180
Planning and Zoning is fired up because

523
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:23,269
people can see and smell pot and that's

524
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,890
bad as far as they're concerned and they

525
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:27,079
would like to come up with rules and

526
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,259
regulations so that no one ever sees or

527
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:33,470
smells pot and if you're trying to grow

528
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:36,379
your own marijuana or know someone that

529
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,970
is you can see how problematic that

530
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,290
might become if you've got to get it all

531
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,850
the way back out of sight and out of

532
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,210
mind and you can't do that in your own

533
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:46,519
home the problems with this ordinance

534
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,029
sort of spin out of control real rapidly

535
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,639
and we as far as the community goes I

536
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:55,519
think don't like it on every every part

537
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
of it is bad and so we tried to rally up

538
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,700
people with the last episode and a

539
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,009
couple of other things to get down to

540
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,779
the meeting and this time we had a

541
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:05,869
pretty good show of support at the City

542
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:08,359
Council meeting on Tuesday night I spoke

543
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:10,759
during public forum and sort of pleaded

544
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,199
with them to think about how many people

545
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,450
in the city they're affecting with these

546
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,000
rules how many people's rights under

547
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,650
amendment 20 or many amendment 64 would

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,210
be restricted by these rules

549
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,340
I mean now all the sudden you've got

550
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,319
roommates trying to figure out who gets

551
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,970
to exercise their constitutional rights

552
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,069
and who doesn't because you can only

553
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,920
exercise so many of them at one time in

554
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:32,839
a home with the plan Mike with

555
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,610
statistics and counts he told the City

556
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,529
Council how many patients there are in

557
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:38,419
the city and county he told them how

558
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:40,460
many of them have a caregiver he told

559
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,920
him how much it cost to make a facility

560
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,299
like they're required most of the people

561
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,220
that spoke at City Council the City

562
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,569
Council kind of gave them the look of

563
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,730
yeah we've heard this before in your

564
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,250
back again this week Thanks gotcha

565
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,779
when Mike spoke they all kind of sat up

566
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,950
they actually leaned forward and

567
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,389
listened I was paying more attention to

568
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,539
their faces and just listening to Mike

569
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,460
but uh they like it when I speak a

570
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,409
number of council members have told me

571
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,880
like thanks for having like some data to

572
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,490
back up what you're saying are you

573
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,370
taking the time to read a difference

574
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,589
they get a lot of rambling at them and

575
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:14,449
like angry rambling and you know you're

576
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:17,059
fired up and you're passionate I'm not

577
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,590
I'm not a big fan of public speaking it

578
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:20,569
makes me incredibly nervous honestly I

579
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:22,159
we did our best to calm you down

580
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:29,750
you said I'm nervous as [ __ ] and so we

581
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:31,730
just started talking to him but

582
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,930
somebody's got to do it and I've been

583
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,610
the one that's been biting that bull

584
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,279
lately so I went down to his day and I

585
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,019
and said my piece and honestly like

586
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,849
usually when people bring supporters

587
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,519
down for their issue lately when the the

588
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:44,869
trash haulers speak there's like five or

589
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,960
ten trash hollers behind them that

590
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:49,699
really take a minute to cheer and clap

591
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,350
as soon as the whoever's got enough to

592
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,900
speak is done speaking and I

593
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:56,839
half-expected what were there six or

594
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,670
seven people behind us maybe Benson

595
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,369
there's about eight of us oh he plus us

596
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,050
I wasn't sure how well I did when I get

597
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:05,359
up and I start giving a speech honestly

598
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,849
I go into a weird little zone where I

599
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,219
know what kind of what I'm saying and

600
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,869
I'm prepared to say you know something

601
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,769
specific but once I get up and start

602
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,619
talking

603
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,960
there isn't a filter between like brain

604
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,609
mic and mouth mic there's nobody being

605
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,829
like don't cuss or make sure you

606
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:23,449
emphasize this it's all the best part

607
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:25,220
adrenaline did you realize what you said

608
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,660
at the end you stood up and he said

609
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,809
thank you for my time and he walked away

610
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,810
from

611
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,680
[Music]

612
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:44,108
[Music]

613
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,789
by coming out and showing support by you

614
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,259
speaking and there was another guy that

615
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,849
went to another meeting who spoke about

616
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:55,660
his family and how this was affecting

617
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:57,099
them in such a dramatic way did you guys

618
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,759
make a difference did we all make a

619
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,740
difference

620
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:06,730
is first in a while okay guys so Monday

621
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,730
we had a city meeting or starting Monday

622
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,140
or since Monday we've had a city council

623
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,480
meeting of planning and zoning meeting

624
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,580
and at County Commissioners meeting at

625
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,410
each one of those three meetings they

626
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,909
were discussing rules that would take

627
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,070
away your ability to grow in your own

628
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,960
home will emit the amount of plants

629
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:24,759
you're you're growing to an arbitrary

630
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,440
number that they just picked they

631
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,299
decided I that ought to be enough good

632
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,299
enough will capitate twelve in the city

633
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,399
or sixteen or eighteen in the county and

634
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:35,980
if you live up in Beulah and have four

635
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,660
hundred acres and all that's one

636
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,730
property you can only grow eighteen

637
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,170
plants there it doesn't matter how many

638
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,150
different residents are set up on your

639
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,580
property and none of that they're just

640
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,140
really terrible rules so the community

641
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,549
kind of tried to rally we did the

642
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,700
podcast episode there was another

643
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:53,139

they wanted to speak spoke I met the

652
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,279
gentleman who was quoted in the

653
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,419
chieftain who he's a young guy he's a

654
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,599
little younger than me I'd say he's

655
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,759
maybe 25 he's got a wife who's sick he's

656
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,659
got a mother-in-law who's sick and he's

657
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,299
got a child with cancer

658
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,910
and she's their caregiver he has a job

659
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,190
where he can't consume so he's just

660
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,990
taking care of them in his testimony I

661
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,880
mean it was like I was throwing

662
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,430
spitballs and he rolled up in a tank

663
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,380
like they could they heard what I had to

664
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,269
say it all three meetings and they

665
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,910
appreciated me coming down and saying my

666
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:59,599
piece but when he got up and spoke they

667
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:06,110
hit the brakes hard so you opened up for

668
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:08,750
this guy so what's come of your guys's

669
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:11,229
work did they stop it did they hesitate

670
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,420
are they gonna rework it the county is

671
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:20,029
they delayed the vote again to do more

672
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:21,890
research I think for two weeks okay

673
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:23,660
maybe three watch the County

674
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,210
Commissioners website they post their

675
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,130
agendas on Fridays usually their

676
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,750
meetings are usually Tuesday so you get

677
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:34,370
about five days to check it out and

678
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:37,880
heads up the city has the Planning and

679
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:40,639
Zoning Commission delayed presenting

680
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,400
this plan to City Council by two months

681
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,200
and they have given those that came to

682
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,820
speak at the Planning and Zoning meeting

683
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,160
a seat at the table while these roles

684
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,809
get reworked so a couple of us they came

685
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,610
to speak against and a couple of people

686
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,169
that came to speak for will be sitting

687
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,549
at the table while these get redone

688
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:59,300
that's something I kind of wanted to ask

689
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,950
you is hue you said when you address

690
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,599
City Council you actually said guys

691
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,250
please find somebody that knows what

692
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,419
they're talking about when you do this

693
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,680
you look them straight in the face like

694
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,630
you guys don't know anything about weed

695
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,920
please find somebody that knows what

696
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,380
they're talking about put them on your

697
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,450
committee if I almost considered

698
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,180
volunteering or asking you how I get to

699
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,980
be a part of that because I am a legal

700
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,509
grower and I'm a caregiver I'm not a

701
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,750
black market guy I think I can set a

702
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:25,490
good example it's more than once I've

703
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,170
fantasized about being able to like

704
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,670
kidnap and hood a member of city

705
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,440
government like sneak him through your

706
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,690
backyard and this is what it looks like

707
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,580
when it's done right this is what legal

708
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,769
looks like this is following the rules

709
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:38,689
like yeah because unless you've blown

710
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:41,240
your house up or you set your garage on

711
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,730
fire overloaded the transformer behind

712
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,380
your house they've never come to your

713
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,849
home that was Mike's main point to City

714
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,440
Council he said the guys you're messing

715
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:49,969
with are the not the

716
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,380
caregivers those are commercial growers

717
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,480
that are making a weed drop you're

718
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,220
making those rules to enforce upon

719
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,089
medical caregivers and you're totally

720
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,680
missing the point

721
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,809
yeah I think they caught on I think

722
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,910
we've got more time to deal with it so

723
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:04,700
did you get on that committee work it

724
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,019
out what then Oh like there's a handful

725
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,220
of us that are scrambling if you're

726
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,950
listening to this show and you are

727
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,269
interested in cannabis advocacy you can

728
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,390
find me on Twitter

729
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:18,740
Nimmo Punk 15 just like it sounds any mo

730
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,060
p1k 1/5 or I just created a Facebook

731
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,259
page it was something somebody else at

732
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:23,240
one of the meetings brought up it'd be

733
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,220
great if we had a Facebook page where we

734
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,009
could kind of kick out community

735
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,329
activism info and organize people for

736
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:33,140
when the meetings are because all of

737
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:37,348
that can be very confusing and I know

738
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,349

740
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:57,019

741
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,059
state or if you're out of Pueblo like

742

City Council wherever you're at I local

746
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:11,149
politics is interesting because it's the

747
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,590
stuff that most affects you so you

748
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,360
should be kind of keeping an eye on your

749
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:16,490
local council anyway and B if you're

750
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,500
trying to legalize marijuana on any

751
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,809
level getting the people that are

752
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,410
elected right above you is the place to

start

754

00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:00,429
beginning like Rogen does yeah because

815
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:09,610
if I prefer you don't but if you want to

816
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:11,769
you just skip right through so if you

817
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,019
look on my table I've not been paid for

818
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:17,170
this yet but there may be in the future

819
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:18,820
I ordered naturebox dude I approve of

820
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,579
naturebox they do not sponsor the show

821
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,680
in any way yet but it's awesome it

822
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,289
tastes good it's good serving sizes

823
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,179
I've been replacing by sugary desires

824
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:29,619
with something from nature box and I

825
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,269
feel better man my teeth aren't gonna

826
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:33,190
rot away as quickly my goats aren't

827
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:36,039
gonna die I'm not gonna get diabetes and

828
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,360
that [ __ ] is good it's tasty I wouldn't

829
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,159
go to the store and buy that because at

830
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,599
the store this don't sound like a paid

831
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:42,629
commercial dude but this is the truth at

832
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,799
the store there's chocolate covered this

833
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,710
discover that there's crispy this

834
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,500
there's and oh man so you just want to

835
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,019
chop lady one but then when naturebox

836
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,260
sends you a box alike there was tomato

837
00:36:53,019 --> 00:37:00,340
basil covered almonds in there well

838
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,810

863
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:43,599
nitrous in my [ __ ] so you don't want

864
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:47,559
to take a half gram dad but the thing is

865
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,049
I'm getting like a huge high off of one

866
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,719
hit and that's and I know we've said

867
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:56,200
this since before I was smoking we said

868
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,789
start slow now if I think here in a

869
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,619
couple of minutes like it didn't hit me

870
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:00,789
well enough I might take another one I'm

871
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:04,630
not doing that today I gotta work

872
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:06,940
tonight but that's the things I need to

873
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,400
know how do I get my handsome on some

874
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,490
like mediocre weed unless I'm growin

875
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,900
sore fine in the ditch somewhere

876
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:24,919
my smartass answer is just go to the

877
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:29,329
dispensary or maybe you need something

878
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:33,108
more high in CBD THC would be beneficial

879
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:35,389
for you alone here there are a ton of

880
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:38,029
people that have either avoided

881
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,559
marijuana because the legalities or you

882
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,830
know for whatever reason and are now

883
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:45,500
walking into a dispensary going mm-hmm

884
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:47,119
and yeah they've rookie cookie is the

885
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,289
product name that sticks in my mind

886
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,880
there was an article about at the Denver

887
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:51,920
Post not too long ago is that an actual

888
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,809
Colorado product I'm pretty sure that is

889
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,619
a product that's sitting on Colorado

890
00:39:53,809 --> 00:40:00,199
dispensaries that's just a cookie cookie

891
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:02,300
walked in as a 55 year old dude into a

892
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,789
dispensary and hadn't really consumed

893
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:10,070
cannabis ever and I saw rookie cookies I

894
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:23,269
would like clap and laugh that's me do

895
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:25,970
you have rookie weed too and they're

896
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:28,009
like well it's legal now what's the bar

897
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:30,589
I can join the military and go smokes

898
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:33,080
and that's fine but it's just I don't

899
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:41,660
want kids starting like with with some

900
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:44,389
goddamn Bruce Banner little [ __ ] yeah

901
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:46,759
it's like four hours I can't do anything

902
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:48,259
like I'm just like alright I'm like I

903
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,570
guess I'm going through the cosmos right

904
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,280
now my mom used to smoke occasionally

905
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,900
not to bust my mom out but back in the

906
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,940
day my mom's [ __ ] hippie dude she

907
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,650
smoked weed back in the day and she's

908
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,940
slowly quit and she doesn't smoked for

909
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,590
years now that she's got a good job and

910
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,000
[ __ ] but I joke with her every

911
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,590
occasionally you know like it was smoked

912
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,389
joint mom and she's like I would but

913
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,890
your your weed's too damn strong

914
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:10,250
she's like the last time I smoked with

915
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:11,480
you guys it was just hell she was a

916
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,429
pothead dude she's the wake-and-bake

917
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,289
like I remember when I was little earned

918
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,149
my uncle's hang out smoke joints all day

919
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,829
long and now she's like nope that weed

920
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,358
gets me too high at my uncle's were the

921
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:21,559
same way too they used to be that's

922
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:23,608
where I learned my [ __ ] was from my

923
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,078
uncles that were pious and party animals

924
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:27,058
and now now they're like dude you're

925
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,519
crazy that weights too good like it's

926
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,569
too good that's kind of funny

927
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:31,978
yeah well and then you're gonna get

928
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:33,989
those guys that used to smoke eight

929
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:36,058
joints and not get high back to the 70s

930
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:37,469
because it was dirt wheat and then they

931
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,269
come in they're like well [ __ ] I could

932
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:41,548
smoke whole joint why would I even be

933
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:43,379
worried about it and it's been 20 years

934
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:44,759
so they have zero tolerance and all of a

935
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,289
sudden they're thinking oh this is gonna

936
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:49,259
be the same thing as that [ __ ] dirt

937
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:52,170
weed if they go home joint take five

938
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:54,748
hits and get halfway through it yeah by

939
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,430
then it's too far the Colorado rules the

940
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:59,278
laws say that they're supposed to have

941
00:41:56,429 --> 00:42:01,139
every product tested even the buds so

942
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:03,239
they should have a THC level turn it on

943
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:04,440
the jars we're not there yet a lot of

944
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,489
the shops aren't complying they just

945
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,739
can't afford it and there's not enough

946
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,389
testing facilities Yeah right once we

947
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,159
get to that point you need something

948
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:14,748
like closer to ten well you've been

949
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:16,920
smoking is in the 20 range 20% yeah

950
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:22,018
that's tested in the twenty sevens

951
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:25,579
Spence actually hit 29 from those

952
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:27,899
Ryann's Rhino from seed the Spence crew

953
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:30,209
also shot up the steep hill Haley labs

954
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,880
are the ones that test our stuff yeah

955
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:34,528
good job but that's what I'm getting at

956
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,209
is like there's just like I don't know

957
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:39,119
you know I guess that was more my

958
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:58,108
question was like is there a strain that

959
00:42:39,119 --> 00:43:00,690
you would recommend to a newbie 50/50

960
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:03,028
hybrid it's not too overpowering it's

961
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,548
got a good body it's got a good high but

962
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:07,199
for me it doesn't hit me hard I almost

963
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:08,429
got rid of it but a lot of my friends

964
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,920
are like - you've got to grow the flow

965
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:12,808
so it's still here flows what I liked

966
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,489
for days for a long time when you've got

967
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:17,130
a whole bunch of stuff to do but can't

968
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:19,409
be in pain all day I roll up a little

969
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,690
flow for the morning and I'd be good all

970
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:23,728
day and it wasn't near as powerful

971
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,969
that's what I wanted for evenings but

972
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:28,439
maybe like zine Jillybean might be good

973
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:30,179
for you yeah just something to maintain

974
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,699
you know like I'm not trying to get all

975
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:34,149
[ __ ] blasted and go take a nap like I

976
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:37,440
gotta do the laundry

977
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,240
you know speaking of laundry these

978
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,088
cashews was that almonds or cashews

979
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:45,219
they're coconut cashews really good

980
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:47,349
those are delicious dude naturebox all

981
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:49,328
day that's why I set him down because I

982
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:51,430
wanted to have one of the time because I

983
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:53,289
was because I loved it so much and now

984
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:54,879
I'm a guy who is listened to Rogen's

985
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:56,890
podcast and everybody's podcast that

986
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,869
says oh go get a cheese box this

987
00:43:56,889 --> 00:44:01,088
converted me right now it did I'm gonna

988
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:15,970
go home and and if I can remember and

989
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:18,759
not be high all the time

990
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:20,679
I think Nerdist even promotes naturebox

991
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:22,088
so they did a free thing they're like if

992

you order now it's free you get a free

993
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:24,730

994
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,199
of munchies that we're eating

995
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,748
they came straight to the door but now

996
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:34,889
every month I'm gonna get a box for five

997
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:37,419
I think I think it's worth what I would

998
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:45,818
yeah it's like the Columbia House of

999

1006
00:44:55,778 --> 00:45:10,778
we've been recording for a long time and

1007
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:12,519
I guess some news so save me a couple of

1008
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:13,989
minutes to read a couple of listener

1009
00:45:12,518 --> 00:45:15,669
comments but tell us about the new

1010
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:16,838
cannabis news that you were telling me

1011
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,960
about when he first showed up to the

1012
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,838
house the local prophets inside oh the

1013
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,539
the locals Pueblo city budget came out

1014
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:27,940
this week and the city seems to think

1015
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:33,400
they're gonna get 500,000 worth of

1016
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:36,369
marijuana taxes wait for the punchline

1017
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,989
the punchline to that is is the the

1018
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,630
number that they're gonna get next year

1019
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:42,759
is zero not five hundred thousand and

1020
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,749
it's zero instead of five hundred

1021
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:45,190
thousand because we don't have any

1022
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:46,659
marijuana businesses you actually have

1023
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,849
to actually have to have

1024
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:51,789
a marijuana business located in your

1025
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:54,549
city to enjoy taxes from those

1026
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:56,710
businesses in the public county has

1027
00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:00,010
already made about 500 grand this year

1028
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:01,929
between the wreck shops and the medical

1029
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,820
shops the local tax and the little

1030
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:06,730
kickback that the state sends on the

1031
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,710
statewide tags look most of City Council

1032
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,780
in the face recently they seem like an

1033
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,369
intelligent group of people where are

1034
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,750
they predicting this money comes from if

1035
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,150
we're not allowed to have a dispensary

1036
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,619
the the city manager puts that budget

1037
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,180
together and hands it to City Council

1038
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:21,130
that's part of the meeting we saw the

1039
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:23,559
other night and so they're probably

1040
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,420
looking at it thinking the same thing

1041
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,769
everyone in Pueblo the red the chieftain

1042
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,260
today and the three of us are thinking

1043
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:30,969
is well if it's really zero because we

1044
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,690
don't have any marijuana businesses

1045
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:36,909
where is this five hundred thousand the

1046
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,559
irony in that is I honestly I rarely go

1047
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,599
to City Council meetings and I will now

1048
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,250
I'm an anxious person and I felt

1049
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,839
intimidated to go I've broken the ice

1050
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,449
and I'm not afraid anymore you'll see me

1051
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,530
there more often thank you I don't know

1052
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:49,000
what I was gonna say it remind me where

1053
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,010
I was headed with that oh right at the

1054
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,960
beginning one of their first things was

1055
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,430
and we're proud to announce it last week

1056
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,990
where our budget was like four hundred

1057
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:57,039
and eighty four thousand dollars or

1058
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,869
million dollars short

1059
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,130
but we've presented to you a balanced

1060
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:02,319
budget this week and that's one of the

1061
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,610
things we fixed in our work sessions but

1062
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,120
they didn't really present a balanced

1063
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,980
budget

1064
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,630
they just revealed their secret they

1065
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,280
added in five hundred thousand dollars

1066
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:12,730
that they're not gonna get they made it

1067
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,800
up a little worried about if that 500

1068
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,170
grand pot number was in there before

1069
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,730
they carved out the three and a half

1070
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:21,099
million or whatever that they carved out

1071
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,869
over the last week they might have been

1072
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:24,400
four million short and they only filled

1073
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:25,719
the hole three and a half million worth

1074
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,340
because they're pretending there's

1075
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:34,059
another half million that's gonna come

1076
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:36,010
out a couple of dispensaries build

1077
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,840
within city limits the licensing alone

1078
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,480
is three hundred third I think it's like

1079
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,550
three thousand dollars for one each

1080
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,199
license you have to have several

1081
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,210
depending on what you're doing is five

1082
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:49,149
grand to the city and the state

1083
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:51,369
so it's essentially ten grand to do just

1084
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,910
to grow ten grand to do the store ten

1085
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,400
grand to do the hash making

1086
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:58,779
so if they open five shops they make 25

1087
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:03,559
G's right away minimum the cities are

1088
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:05,150
five shops 50 G's oh you mean split it

1089
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,489
but but the problem with that though is

1090
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,619
what they're worried about is that you

1091
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:11,809
can't just allow one cuz that's monopoly

1092
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:14,119
and you can't just allow five cuz that's

1093
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:16,159
still a monopoly in my opinion you can't

1094
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,869
say oh you got here too late you're not

1095
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,549
allowed to start that's not the American

1096
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:21,619
Way this town doesn't really need more

1097
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,510
than and this sounds ridiculous coming

1098
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:24,679
from me but if a shop did it right three

1099
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,390
or four shops would be more than enough

1100
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,519
for this city I agree but that's that's

1101
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:30,109
on the businesses to decide later like

1102
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:33,110
oh you know I don't think we can make

1103
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,510
money by starting one so yeah we're

1104
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,730
gonna get influx of five and then all of

1105
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,830
a sudden it's gonna be like wow we're

1106
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,929
all not doing great but this guy's not

1107
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:44,239
doing well at all and then he closes

1108
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:46,129
down and we're gonna see that one of

1109
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,329
these days we're gonna see the first pot

1110
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,110
shop closed down we're gonna be like

1111
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:49,849
that's weird

1112
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,170
like if the liquor store goes out we're

1113
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,829
like oh we get it because there's a

1114
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,880
liquor store on everything every corner

1115
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:56,880
[Music]

1116
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,860
no but what I'm saying is like we see a

1117
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:07,369
liquor store on every and there's a bar

1118
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,990
on every other one so we see all these

1119
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:10,369
liquor stores in a liquor store goes out

1120
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,589
we're like oh yeah of course it did

1121
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,210
there's super competition yeah that's

1122
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,800
what's gonna happen with weed and so

1123
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,170
prices are gonna have to start dropping

1124
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,789
and that's better for everybody if

1125
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:22,190
that's in Washington right now you're

1126
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:25,699
looking at $60 and change for a gram of

1127
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:27,500
legal marijuana yeah look dude you just

1128
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:30,079
gave me a look that you shouldn't give

1129
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,000
me because it's nuts but if you say $60

1130
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,230
for a gram of marijuana you need to slap

some alpha chronic we actually talking

1138
00:49:52,519 --> 00:50:10,210
about $60 grams is that because of a

1139
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:13,010
supply and demand thing yeah that's the

1140
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:15,470
all of the shops in Washington there's a

1141
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,720
very few shops that are open their

1142
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:19,399
supply is extremely limited they didn't

1143
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:21,559
have the time to bring in the crops

1144
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,030
before this all went live like with the

1145
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,090
licensing you weren't allowed to grow

1146
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,100
for very long before shops were allowed

1147
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:31,309
to open so they just haven't had any

1148
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,829
time in a year to when you know shop

1149
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:35,090
numbers have risen significantly

1150
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:37,009
production numbers you know ahead of

1151
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:39,800
time to come in all of that will change

1152
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,600
a bit but it's gonna be a year too

1153
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,910
before you can buy a reasonable gram

1154
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,349
legally in Washington Seattle has no

1155
00:50:43,909 --> 00:51:01,429
idea what's coming to them I know a

1156

little secret right now Seattle got some

1157
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:23,329
cool news there's a lot of cool stuff we

1158
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:26,779
didn't I'm always constantly afraid of

1159
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:28,309
like whatever I get this gonna kill me

1160
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,160
like is this the one that sends me into

1161
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:32,750
like a panic or something like that like

1162
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,149

trip or anything like that then you're

1166
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,800
probably not gonna know that's the thing

1167
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:56,989
is I can talk myself out of it because I

a bad handle though bro to listen to but

1266
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:38,280
be prepared for some stoner moments like

1267
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:44,250
where was this conversation going and

1268
00:58:38,280 --> 00:59:02,460
what were we talking about award-winning

1269
00:58:44,250 --> 00:59:05,159
hash award-winning flowers random [ __ ]

1270
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:10,139

1271
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:11,849
everything I used to listen to like this

1272
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:13,889
good evening thank you for listening to

1273
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:16,289
high culture podcast my name is Jeff and

1274
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:17,909
now I write like bullet points and try

1275
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:19,380
to rant on those bullet points and keep

1276
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:21,779
it moving because it feels a lot better

1277
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,320
but that does create those donor moments

1278
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,320
that's for sure

1279
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:31,740
Billy buh buh ray yeah that's when he

1280
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:46,590
wrote he gave us four stars so that's

1281
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:48,919
cool enough Billy Ray Billy Bob we

1282
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:53,550
apologize for butchering your name

1283
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:56,280
making it fun it's good I don't think we

1284
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:57,840
had any where's this going moments I

1285
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,360
think this whole episode was aware the

1286
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:06,660
hell is going I felt like Jeff was

1287
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:07,890
trying to drag me back to the point guys

1288
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:10,460

1533
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:02,639
pueblo [ __ ] bubble area coming out to the

1534

gathering we'll announce it for sure

1535
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,670
when we get it figured out hopefully we

1536
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,230
can get some listeners out there and

1537
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,940
meet the people they come shake our

1538
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:10,229
hands and we can find out who we're

1539
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:12,949
talking to for sure

1540
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:15,779
Armando we want you to come to one yeah

1541
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:17,130
all right so we were talking about

1542
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,389
building your drone rooms and last night

1543
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,680
there were actually some new growers at

1544
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,240
the party and we got to help them build

1545
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:26,460
pretty sweet room that's kind of nice

1546
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:28,920
too because we had the exact same idea

1547
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,560
in our head like do this they pretty

1548
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,970
much were gonna do that I think we're

1549
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,400
gonna talk about a few different ways to

1550
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:37,079
set up a gross space that is suitable

1551
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:39,719
for your production needs

1552
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:41,760
I also found a comment on the Facebook

1553
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:46,110
page that asks for guidance in building

1554
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,460
a space for $500 that's a really tight

1555
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:48,750
budget for a grow room but I'll see what

1556
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,939
I can come up with I Google the few

1557
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:55,020
items to try to save some pennies but

1558
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:57,389
that's a challenge dude 500 bucks well

1559
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:59,010
she just said help me out teach me how

1560
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:02,010
to build a space for 500 bucks she said

1561
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:03,449
she's uh on a very low budget I have her

1562
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:04,680
Facebook comment after read remember

1563
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:06,269
exactly what she said but I think she's

1564
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,350
also disabled so we're gonna have to

1565
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,920
build her something that's not heavy

1566
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:13,140
that's not a lot of work I have an idea

1567
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,909
and I want to build like a PVC frame and

1568
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:20,520
then wrap it in some sort of mylar type

1569
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:21,930
thing and then we'll talk more about

1570
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,450
that we'll get that going once we get

1571
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:27,119
into the building that gross stuff a

1572
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:29,609
little more let's talk about building

1573
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,170
grows there's a few things to consider

1574
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:32,729
when you're gonna plan your girl before

1575
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:33,960
you even go to the hardware store before

1576
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,459
you ever go to the hydro shop there's

1577
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,949
stuff you got to think about the first

1578
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:41,220
thing to think about in my opinion is is

1579
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:42,720
it legal where you are I'm not gonna

1580
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,600
help you break the law the first part of

1581
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,240
this is move to a location where

1582
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,460
cannabis is legal if you want to follow

1583
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:52,649
my rules so don't do this in an illegal

1584
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,500
State move to Colorado go to California

1585
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:57,029
or even better do what you can to get

1586
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,399
cannabis legalized or decriminalized

1587
01:11:57,029 --> 01:12:00,989
where you are so that you can grow

1588
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:03,059
legally I don't want to be responsible

1589
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:04,409
for you breaking the law so if you plan

1590
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,170
on breaking the law just change to

1591
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:11,000
another podcast

1592
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:12,710
I don't want you to go to jail for what

1593
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,448
I'm telling you but you're gonna do what

1594
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,539
you gonna do so the next thing to think

1595
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:19,369
about understand the risk you're taking

1596
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:21,350
because if you're drawing in a state

1597
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:23,000
that's not legal the consequences can be

1598
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:25,190
quite severe it's not just you you're

1599
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,899
putting at risk if you're drawing in a

1600
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:29,059
house everybody in that house is in

1601
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:30,829
trouble if you have a family and you go

1602
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:33,440
to jail that's gonna just cause a tidal

1603
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:35,840
wave of [ __ ] in your life so keep

1604
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,069
that in mind the next thing that I would

1605
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,600
say to think about is what are your

1606
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:39,799
realistic needs if you're committed

1607
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,660
you're gonna grow some cannabis for

1608
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,130
yourself what are your realistic needs

1609
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:45,710
do you need to grow for yourself your

1610
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:47,239
family maybe a few patients or are you

1611
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,090
trying to become the next big production

1612
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:51,769
facility in your area so my next idea

1613
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:54,440
would be set a goal and kind of stick

1614
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:55,940
with that for a few cycles to see what

1615
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:57,409
you're doing you can't you're not gonna

1616
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:58,729
know how good of a grower or what kind

1617
01:12:57,409 --> 01:13:00,619
of crop you get on the first grow stick

1618
01:12:58,729 --> 01:13:02,569
with that set something up stick with it

1619
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:04,250
for a couple of cycles and then adjust

1620
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:06,439
to your needs after you've gone a couple

1621
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,640
rounds like don't run your first lap and

1622
01:13:06,439 --> 01:13:09,019
then think my shoes are too tight my

1623
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,079
shoes are too loose run a couple laps

1624
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,780
see what you're good at then adjust so

1625
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:16,909
my next thing to consider I would say is

1626
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:19,880
does your location have viable

1627
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:21,559
electricity this is something Jesse

1628
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,719
really stressed on when he got here to

1629
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,130
talk about this I run in more than one

1630
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,500
or two thousand watt lights in a room

1631
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:29,270
may require some electrical upgrades if

1632
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,159
you want to be safe if your breakers are

1633
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:32,449
flipping and you're scrambling to keep

1634
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:35,149
everything running that's when you're

1635
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:36,439
trading a fire hazard yeah you don't

1636
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:40,069
want to be on the news for burning down

1637
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:42,139
your house growing weed no in your

1638
01:13:40,069 --> 01:13:44,029
experience can you usually just run like

1639
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:45,890
a thousand watt light is a blower that

1640
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:47,210
it requires and a couple of fans and if

1641
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:48,500
you have like a hydro bubbler or

1642
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:51,079
whatever is that pretty much what one

1643
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:54,170
room can do yeah most most residential

1644
01:13:51,079 --> 01:13:55,429
rooms about 30 30 amp breaker yeah so

1645
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,199
that you're and if you're putting an air

1646
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:58,909
conditioner in there you're taking up

1647
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,159
half a breaker just with that the light

1648
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:02,569
takes up about half a breaker all right

1649
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:05,269
if you're flipping the breaker when you

1650
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:06,859
turn on the dishwasher or whatever have

1651
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,840
an electrician come and help you out

1652
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,309
there are a lot of electricians actually

1653
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,929
if you're in the Pueblo area I have an

1654
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:13,580
electrician that I will refer because

1655
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:17,329
he's looking for some work he's off and

1656
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:18,890
he could use your your job so don't burn

1657
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:19,719
down the house please please don't burn

1658
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,910
down the house don't trade

1659
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:23,289
fire hazard with electricity also if

1660
01:14:21,909 --> 01:14:24,430
you're any illegal in an illegal state

1661
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:25,899
this is something I just thought of

1662
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:29,079
you're gonna have to have an excuse for

1663
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:30,519
all that electricity if you're one

1664
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:32,590
thousand watt light is gonna kick your

1665
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,300
light bill up about $100 per month

1666
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,100
an additional hunt like the light and

1667
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,329
the fan and the blower it takes to run

1668
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,969
it you're looking about another 100

1669
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:41,859
dollars every month if you're just a

1670
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:44,409
dude in an apartment or something like

1671
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:46,689
that that may spark some concerns you

1672
01:14:44,409 --> 01:14:48,729
might want to get a hot tub we've heard

1673
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:49,839
of people using welding equipment just

1674
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:51,579
get something to kind of make it look

1675
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,079
like you're doing something put a bunch

1676
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:54,698
of table saws in the garage if you've

1677
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:55,600
got that option you know look like you

1678
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:58,179
have somewhere for that power

1679
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:02,710
consumption to go empty empty saltwater

1680
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:05,140
fish tanks but you know all of that

1681
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:06,760
stuff I bet you they can tell that my

1682
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,380
timers are on twelve twelve over at the

1683
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,760
crow you know they're like oh yeah every

1684
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:13,210
day at eight o'clock this guy kicks on

1685
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:15,550
thousands of watts o'clock they kick off

1686
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:18,730
they're not [ __ ] sorry [ __ ] is

1687
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:20,350
an offensive word to you so will you be

1688
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:22,359
able to ventilate your space is the next

1689
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:24,370
thing I would think about fresh air is

1690
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:26,710
super important stale stagnant humid air

1691
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:28,599
is the number one cause for powdery

1692
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,189
mildew it'll also slow your growth and

1693
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,780
makes your plants look ugly thanks for

1694
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:33,099
room stink you want to be able to walk

1695
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:35,109
into your grow room and close your eyes

1696
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:37,719
and not smell pot you want it to smell

1697
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:39,279
like a nice clean room so keep that in

1698
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:42,039
mind you have to be able to ventilate

1699
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:43,899
that space number five on my list of

1700
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:45,819
things that you should consider is your

1701
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:47,379
gross space safe and secure you may need

1702
01:15:45,819 --> 01:15:48,969
to hide your growth from the landlord or

1703
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,829
your nosy in-laws that come over for

1704
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:52,869
dinner are you ready to live the grow

1705
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:54,519
life in your house that doesn't sound

1706
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:56,649
like a huge question but dude when

1707
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,270
you've got pot plants in your house your

1708
01:15:56,649 --> 01:16:00,399
whole house will stink if you don't have

1709
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:01,930
it under control you might need some

1710
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,689
carbon filters you might need an extra

1711
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,159
carbon filter or two I always have a

1712
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:09,488
carbon filter on the air that is going

1713
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:10,869
out the exhaust but then also I'll hang

1714
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:12,189
a carbon filter with the blower on it

1715
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:14,529
just right in the middle of the room on

1716
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:16,149
the ceiling to act as a scrubber just to

1717
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:18,579
clean even more air and that eliminates

1718
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:21,099
more odor we were talking about ona gel

1719
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:23,260
last night there's no ownage our own

1720
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:25,119
Angele Zin like a plastic jar they say

1721
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,070
to take the lid off

1722
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:28,988
just leave it sitting but I actually

1723
01:16:27,069 --> 01:16:31,359
poked a little pencil sighs holes with

1724
01:16:28,988 --> 01:16:33,579
the drill right in the lid and then just

1725
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,500
let it sit and then once it gets down to

1726
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:36,880
about a third of the jar I just add like

1727
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,349
a half a cup of water in there to shake

1728
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,760
it and it rehydrates all the trista 'ls

1729
01:16:38,349 --> 01:16:42,159
and it lasts a little longer

1730
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,840
put those by your door like your

1731
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:45,789
entryway to your home or entryway to

1732
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,710
wherever you're drawing people's nose

1733
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:50,170
will hit that first and now their nose

1734
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:51,460
is already kinda they've been punched so

1735
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,658
they're confused and when they smell the

1736
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,880
herb they won't know that it's herb

1737
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:59,589
hopefully yeah so you can put them

1738
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,750
inside your ducting to move that odor

1739
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:03,610
around instead of the cannabis odor I'm

1740
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,380
gonna add a random side note this is

1741
01:17:03,609 --> 01:17:06,130
just a really random sidebar because I

1742
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,300
just thought about it

1743
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:09,460
I keep hearing a lot of people say the

1744
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,289
word marijuana marijuana is a racist

1745
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:13,500
word and it sounds bad people are afraid

1746
01:17:11,289 --> 01:17:16,779
of marijuana cannabis is the new word

1747
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:18,729
cannabis sounds better it doesn't sound

1748
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:20,259
as racist and I know that's a weird way

1749
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:23,379
to put it but we were taught that

1750
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:24,880
marijuana is the devil and if you smoke

1751
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,859
marijuana you're gonna get crazy and

1752
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:30,579
rape white [ __ ] cannabis will heal

1753
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:32,109
you cannabis stops cancer so I think we

1754
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,789
should just try to abandon the word

1755
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:35,920
marijuana and say cannabis a lot more

1756
01:17:33,789 --> 01:17:37,960
that's just my random sidebar for the

1757
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,319
day marijuana actually literally is a

1758
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:43,840
racist word that's yeah I mean yeah yeah

1759
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:45,609
yeah don't doubt that people it was

1760
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,800
invented by the government it's a huge

1761
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:49,359
history lesson who discriminate against

1762
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Mexicans yeah they didn't like the

1763
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:53,139
Mexicans that were coming to America and

1764
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,219
smoking marijuana and then bringing it

1765
01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:55,900
to the jazz musicians

1766
01:17:54,219 --> 01:17:57,069
that's all reefer madness you guys

1767
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:58,479
hopefully you know about that already

1768
01:17:57,069 --> 01:18:00,009
and hopefully no hopefully you're but

1769
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,448
not that brainwashed and you never paid

1770
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:05,170
attention to that hopefully you just

1771
01:18:01,448 --> 01:18:06,460
call it cannabis all right live in the

1772
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:09,158
grow life another big thing to consider

1773
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,899
is the location of your grow inside of

1774
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:13,569
your house or wherever you're doing it

1775
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:15,098
the basement is generally the coolest

1776
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,599
spot you're insulated by dirt and

1777
01:18:15,099 --> 01:18:17,980
concrete walls and you're underground

1778
01:18:16,599 --> 01:18:20,199
you don't get a lot of climate changes

1779
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:21,759
there in the basement also hopefully you

1780
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:23,379
don't get a lot of traffic down there in

1781
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,789
the basement you got like one room in

1782
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:27,880
the corner in the back or something you

1783
01:18:24,789 --> 01:18:30,099
can just dedicate the Attic is gonna get

1784
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,980
hot attic is on top of the house it's

1785
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:34,539
getting hit by the Sun you don't have

1786
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:36,189
all this insulation from the dirt and

1787
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:37,868
the concrete walls the attics gonna be a

1788
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,738
little more challenging so you're gonna

1789
01:18:37,868 --> 01:18:41,229
need more cooling

1790
01:18:38,738 --> 01:18:43,479
power you're gonna have to adjust your

1791
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:56,678
snow milks off her the snow melts off

1792
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:59,919
your roof and little that's obvious as

1793
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:01,269
[ __ ] also guys this is some cover a

1794
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,368
little later but I want to jump to it

1795
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:06,550
you're gonna have to get water there so

1796
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:07,808
putting your plants in the Attic I once

1797
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,949
you get all the girl equipment hung up

1798
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,230
up there and everything's up there now

1799
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:14,169
you have to get water up there often so

1800
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:16,328
keep that in mind and then another go

1801
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:17,739
ahead you got some dad attics just if

1802
01:19:16,328 --> 01:19:19,389
you can avoid it's just really not a

1803
01:19:17,738 --> 01:19:22,718
good place to grow it's actually a

1804
01:19:19,389 --> 01:19:26,199
pretty pretty good a fire hazard oh yeah

1805
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:33,429
I mean it's I mean it's significant fire

1806
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:34,960
hazard or something though and you can't

1807
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:40,868
really do it like we can here in

1808
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:45,189
Colorado nobody goes to option we're

1809
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:47,408
talking about earlier be safe but safety

1810
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:48,998
first bro you don't want to be on the

1811
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:51,248
news for burning down your house growing

1812
01:19:48,998 --> 01:19:52,719
pot because when the news comes you

1813
01:19:51,248 --> 01:19:54,908
might have been growing legal medical

1814
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,288
cannabis but as soon as that fire starts

1815
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:59,288
and the news truck pulls out you've got

1816
01:19:56,288 --> 01:20:01,630
a drug lab they're not gonna be polite

1817
01:19:59,288 --> 01:20:03,788
this this medical marijuana provider

1818
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,109
accidentally sparked fire to his home no

1819
01:20:03,788 --> 01:20:06,009
the reports gonna say we're here in

1820
01:20:05,109 --> 01:20:08,649
front of this house where there's a

1821
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:09,849
major drug lab on fire right now that's

1822
01:20:08,649 --> 01:20:11,738
what the reports and you're gonna be the

1823
01:20:09,849 --> 01:20:23,400
[ __ ] that just went to jail for doing

1824
01:20:11,738 --> 01:20:26,169
that yeah lower in the house is better

1825
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,029
in Pueblo they're trying to actually

1826
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:29,618
push and push an ordinance where we have

1827
01:20:28,029 --> 01:20:31,179
to grow in an outbuilding and I was

1828
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:33,248
reading a book doing research on this

1829
01:20:31,179 --> 01:20:35,319
and in Jorge Cervantes book he says

1830
01:20:33,248 --> 01:20:36,698
outbuildings are apps actually the worst

1831
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:39,158
place you could think about growing

1832
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:41,049
because that's where thieves are and the

1833
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:42,879
cops don't consider that trespassing so

1834
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:45,159
they can go into your outbuilding it's

1835
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,809
not part of your home yeah so the cops

1836
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:47,978
can walk right in that's not it's a

1837
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:49,538
different rule you know it's not part of

1838
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:50,269
your domicile it's a shed so they can

1839
01:20:49,538 --> 01:20:52,130
walk right in

1840
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:53,780
they don't need a warrant that's

1841
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:56,118
something we gotta remind all the people

1842
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:58,009
that are opposed to this of Mike did you

1843
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:59,118
just hear that bro you're out building

1844
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:01,369
that they're trying to propose that we

1845
01:20:59,118 --> 01:21:03,018
build will not be part of your home so

1846
01:21:01,368 --> 01:21:04,670
it will not require a warrant is what

1847
01:21:03,019 --> 01:21:07,239
this book that Jorge Cervantes wrote

1848
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:11,349
says let me know how that really works

1849
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:11,348
shout out to Mike he's my legal counsel

1850
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:15,649
groaning I said it has a lot of

1851
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:18,679
challenges too

1852
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:21,649
um so it's gonna be a lot like growing

1853
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:24,170
in an attic as far as trying to insulate

1854
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:27,229
it and cool it up it's gonna be very

1855
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:28,460
difficult and I guess I should thing the

1856
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:30,169
next step here is how are you gonna cool

1857
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,908
the room keep in mind that you have to

1858
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:33,260
use more electricity for that air

1859
01:21:31,908 --> 01:21:35,388
conditioner and the air conditioner has

1860
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,760
to vent itself somewhere so you keep in

1861
01:21:35,389 --> 01:21:38,690
mind how you're gonna cool the room I

1862
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,800
had a good point that I wanted to make

1863
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,399
and it just left my head well were you

1864
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,400
just telling me

1865
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:49,449
okay goal is I guess I should have

1866
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,619
covered this more in the beginning but

1867
01:21:49,448 --> 01:21:53,619
your goal you're building a grow room

1868
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:56,500
you want as much control of the lights

1869
01:21:53,619 --> 01:21:57,939
the air the water the humidity the

1870
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,069
temperature that's what we're trying to

1871
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:02,738
do we're trying to build a room then we

1872
01:22:00,069 --> 01:22:05,529
can control to set the ideal climate for

1873
01:22:02,738 --> 01:22:06,669
these plants I guess we should Internet

1874
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:07,869
just starting building a room we should

1875
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,489
know what we're trying to build right

1876
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:13,149
and that's what you want you want a room

1877
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:16,238
that you can almost automate and let

1878
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:17,920
that happen and just turn everything on

1879
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:19,509
properly get everything set up properly

1880
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,619
and let it run and then when the night

1881
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:22,390
time comes you have a nighttime

1882
01:22:20,619 --> 01:22:23,890
temperature selected it'll get to that

1883
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:26,260
when the day time comes again you have a

1884
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:27,670
date I'm tempted the air-conditioner

1885
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,199
kicks on at the right time your fans

1886
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:31,329
move at the right time your blowers are

1887
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:35,678
all at the right schedule then you can

1888
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:37,840
hit that perfect like 50% humidity or

1889
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:41,230
forty percent humidity mark you can get

1890
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,940
your 77 degree mark in there you can get

1891
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:45,488
it all perfect enough just a little bit

1892
01:22:42,939 --> 01:22:46,899
of wind that's what you're trying to do

1893
01:22:45,488 --> 01:22:48,639
you're trying to build that super happy

1894
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:50,500
trying to build an aquarium for your

1895
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,329
plants or like a cage for plants like

1896
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,640
the perfect habitat for these plants so

1897
01:22:52,329 --> 01:22:56,198
climate inside your house inside your

1898
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,219
house yes that's your goal I guess I

1899
01:22:56,198 --> 01:22:59,919
should've talked more about that at the

1900
01:22:57,219 --> 01:23:03,399
beginning once you achieve that you know

1901
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:08,289
pretty dialed in perfect climate growing

1902
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:11,710
becomes a lot easier a lot easier is the

1903
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:13,810
room the genetics this what you're

1904
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:15,489
feeding and then the grow like how you

1905
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:19,090
grow that's pretty much what your

1906
01:23:15,488 --> 01:23:22,269
components are lights air water soil and

1907
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:24,039
love you know cleanliness is next to

1908
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,380
godliness when it comes to growing every

1909
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,238
little piece of trash or scrap and not

1910
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:32,170
just in your grow room if your grow room

1911
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:35,139
is in like your mom's basement or your

1912
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:37,840
grandma's attic or your bedroom closet

1913
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:39,310
all of those clothes all those books all

1914
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,560
those scraps of paper all those

1915
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:43,659
cigarette butts all the dust that's all

1916
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:45,400
a place for a spider mite to hide that's

1917
01:23:43,658 --> 01:23:48,339
all a place for a thrip to lay a bug

1918
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:50,259
also all that dust and cigarette smoke

1919
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:53,110
will end up in your concentrate and in

1920
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:54,970
your flowers if your I've kind of

1921
01:23:53,109 --> 01:23:56,889
stopped sweeping my grow room now

1922
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,360
after about week six because I don't

1923
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,430
want to stir up the dust and put it in

1924
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:02,199
my flowers I will let my grow room look

1925
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:04,810
a little shitty on the floor for a week

1926
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:06,369
to not sweep it up as often because I

1927
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:07,660
don't and I'll turn off all the fans and

1928
01:24:06,369 --> 01:24:09,699
blowers and air conditioners now to

1929
01:24:07,659 --> 01:24:11,889
sweep up because I don't want that stick

1930
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:13,149
into my buds because that ends up in the

1931
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:15,520
hash and we're trying to make the best

1932
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:16,960
hash we can now that's that seems to be

1933
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,550
the point that everybody's headed to I

1934
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,930
still try to grow the best flowers but

1935
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:23,320
of course we want the best hash to go

1936
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:26,800
with that yeah all right that was a long

1937
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:29,199
rant other than things to consider there

1938
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:33,460
are responsibilities that I think you

1939
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:35,619
should practice being a good grower um

1940
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,840
when you're setting up to grow you don't

1941
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:39,489
want to piss off the neighbors you don't

1942
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,710
want to attract unwanted attention by

1943
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:43,840
thieves or thugs you don't want to get

1944
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,130
cop attention you definitely this is

1945
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,569
something people don't think about there

1946
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:49,119
are kids out there that love to steal

1947
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:51,909
pot plants now kids are getting braver

1948
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:54,309
the younger kids are getting dumber and

1949
01:24:51,909 --> 01:24:55,750
braver they know what pot is they know

1950
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,380

good in that I read genetics t-shirt so

1978
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:53,439
a few responsibilities being a grower

1979
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:55,930
make sure your lights are not visible

1980
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,609
from the outside when you set up your

1981
01:25:55,930 --> 01:26:00,060
draw room when the sun goes down turn on

1982
01:25:57,609 --> 01:26:02,199
all your Dro lights walk outside

1983
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:05,860
whatever if you're in the basement attic

1984
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:07,149
bedroom walk outside and see if you can

1985
01:26:05,859 --> 01:26:09,250
see your grow lights if you can see your

1986
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:10,839
girl lights fix it your feeling that's

1987
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,460
the problem that also means you have a

1988
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,140
light leak yeah that means the lights

1989
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,189
are getting in during your flowering

1990
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:18,850
cycle which you're just gonna cause a

1991
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:20,229
bunch of hermaphrodites also your next

1992
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,940
responsibility make sure the blower's

1993
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:26,049
and fans are not heard by neighbors or

1994
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:27,369
people walking pasture grow if there's a

1995
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:29,409
spot where you don't think people will

1996
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:31,269
ever walk the day you build a dam grow

1997
01:26:29,409 --> 01:26:34,449
someone's gonna walk there the meter

1998
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:36,400
maid the gas guy some kid chasing his

1999
01:26:34,449 --> 01:26:38,019
dog some cop looking for someone else

2000
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:39,819
they're gonna walk right past that

2001
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:41,500
blower and they're gonna go what is this

2002
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:43,420
and you're gonna think no one's ever

2003
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,800
gonna walk there but as soon as you put

2004
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:47,140
a blower they're new they will that's

2005
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,970
the way life works so just be careful

2006
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:50,320
plan ahead make sure no one can hear

2007
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:53,079
your blowers make sure no one can see

2008
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:55,689
your lights there's ways to muffle you

2009
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:58,809
know David insulating the duct

2010
01:26:55,689 --> 01:27:00,719
insulating the blower you can just guys

2011
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:02,760
outlets as a dryer outlet

2012
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,050
yeah you can try to put it through the

2013
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,610
roof

2014
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,930
you know just move the blower to the

2015
01:27:05,609 --> 01:27:08,699
other end of the chain so it's not so

2016
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:11,340
noisy yeah not right in the window

2017
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:12,929
yeah those mufflers are a great idea

2018
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,659
they're actually available at a high

2019
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:15,900
growing or growing supplies and actually

2020
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:18,659
uh

2021
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:21,689
a cheaper alternative to the mufflers

2022
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:24,449
and better for your crow is a HEPA

2023
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:27,389
filter yes those will you know if it's

2024
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:29,880
sucking in those will help you know over

2025
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:31,590
all of my ends where I have I've drilled

2026
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,420
like six inch holes or eight inch holes

2027
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:34,980
to have my ends coming in I get those

2028
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,420
little square HEPA filters that are just

2029
01:27:34,979 --> 01:27:38,069
a sheet like it's not a rectangle and I

2030
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,350
just staple those right over it with a

2031
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:42,479
staple gun onto the wall and wherever I

2032
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:44,160
do grow you want yeah that keeps your

2033
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,389
bugs out keeps all their stuff that you

2034
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:48,300
don't want in your hatch it keeps all

2035
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:51,090
that out of filter everything twice if

2036
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:53,610
you can people are going oh my god how

2037
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,869
much is this gonna cost building a good

2038
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,219
grow room does cost a little bit of

2039
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:58,349
money people were asking last night

2040
01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:00,539
they're like we've got this much budget

2041
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:02,940
should we buy better this or better this

2042
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:04,350
and that's kind of where I think you

2043
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:04,919
should get the best bulbs and ballast

2044
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,870
you can

2045
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,390
that's your first starter and then move

2046
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:10,920
your air and then like if you have to

2047
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:12,600
buy in chunks I think you buy the lights

2048
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,159
and then your air moving stuff like your

2049
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,960
ducting your blowers and then your air

2050
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:18,869
conditioner and then you buy your pots

2051
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,480
and soil and nutrients start with the

2052
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:25,109
room and just buy slowly instead of but

2053
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:27,269
yeah it's the weakest link is always

2054
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:28,559
gonna be the weakest link it's hard to

2055
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,120
decide where to pinch your budget there

2056
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:34,320
get the good bulbs and good ballasts

2057
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:35,309
that's definitely my opinion so here's

2058
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,439
the big issue that we've been dealing

2059
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,539
with here in pueblo this caused a lot of

2060
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,069
most of our new laws here that are being

2061
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:41,460
proposed in pueblo or because of this

2062
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:44,489
issue

2063
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,930
make sure nobody can smell your grow the

2064
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:47,760
smell is the most offensive and

2065
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:49,380
revealing part of your grow yes I said

2066
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,600
offense if there are some people that do

2067
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,909
not love the smell of sweet sweet sticky

2068
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,380
ganja in the morning there's a guy here

2069
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:57,180
in our city that keeps complaining to

2070
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,350
City Council that he can smell pot every

2071
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:02,039
day when he wakes up because his

2072
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:05,340
neighbors are girl in the dank yeah keep

2073
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:06,479
that smell down if you build your grow

2074
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,220
discreetly and you don't bring attention

2075
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,589
yourself your neighbors will never know

2076
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:13,110
you've got a grow in your home it's a

2077
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:16,139
security issue to be no

2078
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:23,880
oh yeah you know don't you know the

2079
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:31,949
system biting people in men when people

2080
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:35,989
find out you grow weeds no dude you're

2081
01:29:31,948 --> 01:29:38,009
talking about [ __ ] dog games you know

2082
01:29:35,988 --> 01:29:40,618
several years ago I lived in another

2083
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:43,320
house and I had a grow in the basement

2084
01:29:40,618 --> 01:29:47,059
there and the power went out and I was

2085
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:48,809

street so don't let anybody smell your

2104
01:30:24,389 --> 01:30:28,500
grow your step number four to be a good

2105
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:29,939
responsible grower when you're building

2106

a girl room do whatever it takes to make

2107
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:32,939
sure no kids get ever get into your

2108
01:30:31,529 --> 01:30:34,889
gross space I stuttered when I said that

2109
01:30:32,939 --> 01:30:36,829
cuz I mean it make sure no kids ever get

2110
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:39,029
into your gross space that's important

2111
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:40,529
that's like the biggest black eye you

2112
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:42,090
can put on the canvas community right

2113
01:30:40,529 --> 01:30:44,340
now is letting kids get caught with your

2114
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,869
weed yeah here's something you might not

2115
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,880
think about most of the stuff was kind

2116
01:30:45,868 --> 01:30:49,500
of uh kind of obvious but here's a good

2117
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,940
one you're gonna create a lot of waste

2118
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,260
growing plants in your house you're

2119
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:53,849
gonna have soil you're gonna have plant

2120
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:56,460
stems and stalks you're gonna have root

2121
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:59,699
balls find a responsible way to dispose

2122
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:01,889
of everything some of you guys live out

2123
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:06,210
in the rural areas burn that [ __ ] if you

2124
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:07,889
can compost did if you can that's yeah

2125
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:10,408
but see I live in the city and my growth

2126
01:31:07,889 --> 01:31:12,539
is in a city facility and so it's all

2127
01:31:10,408 --> 01:31:14,638
got to be chopped up into little tiny

2128
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:15,899
pieces and put into secured trash bags

2129
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,600
and it's got to be destroyed on site

2130
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:20,429
like so the other guys you're gonna have

2131
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,840
to find what if the trash guy is dumping

2132
01:31:20,429 --> 01:31:23,489
your trash and finds all your pot leaves

2133
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,590
in Connecticut in there grandpa

2134
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:26,218
what if he's not cool what if he is cool

2135
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:28,619
he's gonna

2136
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:29,489
he's gonna Rob you if he's not cool he's

2137
01:31:28,618 --> 01:31:32,158
calling the cops

2138
01:31:29,488 --> 01:31:35,069
so be careful I they might find your

2139
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:37,170
trash that's they cannot from Jorge's

2140
01:31:35,069 --> 01:31:39,630
book that I read they cannot start a

2141
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:42,389
case based on your trash that does not

2142
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:45,288
justify a search warrant but the trash

2143
01:31:42,389 --> 01:31:51,479
can be used in court as part of the case

2144
01:31:45,288 --> 01:31:52,738
so evidence people I lived in Lawrence

2145
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,239
Kansas and now that I think about it I

2146
01:31:52,738 --> 01:31:56,158
know people that got busted and had

2147
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,538
their trash used as evidence in court

2148
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,638
now that I think about I can't remember

2149
01:31:57,538 --> 01:32:00,899
their names but uh couple of kids I

2150
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:04,319
worked at a place with what's up guys

2151
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:06,089
I've heard that uh for you know drug

2152
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,248
dealing cases back in the day and stuff

2153
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:10,440
let's find that tape they wrap around

2154
01:32:08,248 --> 01:32:11,158
the packaging yeah I had that happen to

2155
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:12,839
a friend too

2156
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:15,118
I worked at a bowling alley and I found

2157
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,229
a bunch of that tape that dark colored

2158
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:17,880
tape and you could tell it was wrapped

2159
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:19,559
around like him I've seen plenty of

2160
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:21,300
pounds of weed like brick pounds of weed

2161
01:32:19,559 --> 01:32:22,590
I don't know if his Raptor on weed or

2162
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,029
some cocaine or something but it was

2163
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:26,130
that kind of tape and I know exactly

2164
01:32:24,029 --> 01:32:28,439
somebody had a nice bulk of something in

2165
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:29,849
my bowling alley one night well you

2166
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:31,379
found that in the trash at the ball game

2167
01:32:29,849 --> 01:32:33,179
in the trash in the bathroom just

2168
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:36,059
sitting on the top so you're telling me

2169
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:46,498
that someone evidence lockup may have

2170
01:32:36,059 --> 01:32:49,920
been crooked so somebody had a kilo of

2171
01:32:46,498 --> 01:32:51,118
coke weed at the bowling alley which

2172
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:55,078
isn't really surprising now that I'm

2173
01:32:51,118 --> 01:32:57,029
thinking about it sketchy places that

2174
01:32:55,078 --> 01:32:58,469
people don't think about think about you

2175
01:32:57,029 --> 01:32:59,609

2177
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:02,969

2178
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,159

2179

of stuff three lights worth of stuff

2181

2182
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:10,649
and if you don't know what to do if you

2183
01:33:09,599 --> 01:33:11,550

cheap nowadays you don't don't use some

2252
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,010
sketchy [ __ ] [ __ ] if you're running a

plug it into the 240 and plug all the

2255
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,659
lights into that and you're pretty much

2256
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,739
legit you can run like eight lights on

2257

right way

don't run extension cords all over the

2264
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:55,760
data each extension cord is a fire

2265
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:58,190

one big breaker box on the outside of

2280
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:26,000
the room that you can shut everything

2281
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:28,850
off so that you know you can work on

2282
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,710
[ __ ] not get any electricity and that is

2283
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:33,380

on Craigslist if you need to if you're

2286
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:39,020
in the southern Colorado area I've got a

2287
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:41,000
guy I got two guys for you so if this

2288
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:46,820
first guy is busy we can send his his

2289
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:49,039
old boss to come help yeah that's that's

2290
01:36:46,819 --> 01:36:51,349
what we're talking about there's no no

2291
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:53,060
reason for it that should be you know

2292
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:56,150
one of the number one things when you're

2293
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:59,060
setting up a room guys I always add a

2294
01:36:56,149 --> 01:37:01,460
fire extinguisher smoke alarm I put a

2295
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:03,500
smoke detector in the grow rooms put it

2296
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:05,630
near the exhaust fan like if you've got

2297
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,100
a carbon filter sucking air out put it

2298
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:10,010
near there because the smoke is gonna

2299
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:11,870
get sucked toward that that way put the

2300
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:13,789
smoke alarm there I put a fire

2301
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:15,140
extinguisher outside of the damn grill

2302
01:37:13,789 --> 01:37:16,880
room because you don't want to have to

2303
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:18,230
run in there and get the extinguisher if

2304
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,310
that room is on fire you want to be able

2305
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:22,399
to kick in the door and just start

2306
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:24,020
spraying that [ __ ] and hydro indoor

2307
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,969
growing supplies you can pick up an item

2308
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:27,679
called the flame defender I haven't used

2309
01:37:25,969 --> 01:37:29,239
it I've done a lot of research about it

2310
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,069
ah did that

2311
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:33,049
I need those those look like the way to

2312
01:37:31,069 --> 01:37:38,929
go I think we're gonna get ourselves set

2313
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:41,449
up with hopefully we never find out how

2314
01:37:38,929 --> 01:37:43,010
good those work

2315
01:37:41,448 --> 01:37:44,809
so because once you figured out how much

2316
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:46,780
herb you need to produce that's when you

2317
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:49,699
can start designing your gross space

2318
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:51,139
actually sometimes your space dictates

2319
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:53,089
how you build your grow that's where

2320
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,219
that's where the fun kicks in in my

2321
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:57,079
opinion building and grow is all about

2322
01:37:55,219 --> 01:37:58,429
adapting to the space you're provided

2323
01:37:57,079 --> 01:38:00,079
some of you guys are gonna use a small

2324
01:37:58,429 --> 01:38:01,880
closet some of you might use the spare

2325
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:02,539
bedroom some of you guys are gonna buy a

2326
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,400
grow Hut

2327
01:38:02,539 --> 01:38:05,840
set that up I will do a lot of talking

2328
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:08,779
about a grow Hut maybe not on this

2329
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,929
episode already 35 minutes in but I will

2330
01:38:08,779 --> 01:38:14,149
definitely I'm writing that down crow hi

2331
01:38:10,929 --> 01:38:16,880
there very first tutorial yeah a lot of

2332
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:19,009
people made fun of them at first but I

2333
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,779
have done some breeding I've done some

2334
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:22,310
Fino selection I've done some great

2335
01:38:20,779 --> 01:38:24,439
growing and just a grow Hut they're

2336
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:25,370
great if you have limited space you

2337
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:27,769
could put it in the corner of your

2338
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:31,789
bedroom and it's awesome I've seen a

2339
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:37,820
whole bedroom full of them it was quite

2340
01:38:31,789 --> 01:38:39,710
the little production area so a small

2341
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:43,399
plant count here in Pueblo in my house

2342
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:47,539
in a spare bedroom I run two 5x5 hydro

2343
01:38:43,399 --> 01:38:50,000
huts on a flip box with a 600 watt light

2344
01:38:47,539 --> 01:38:52,039
in each Hut but what happens I run one

2345
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,979
ballast the ballast plugs into the wall

2346
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:57,710
on a timer so it goes ballast and then

2347
01:38:54,979 --> 01:38:59,359
there's a cord that goes to the flip box

2348
01:38:57,710 --> 01:39:00,829
and then the flip box has two chords

2349
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:03,979
that come out and a bulb comes from each

2350
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:06,289
one and every 12 hours side a lights up

2351
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:07,519
and then for 12 hours it stays on and

2352
01:39:06,289 --> 01:39:09,439
then it shuts off and the other side

2353
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,060
comes on for 12 hours so instead of

2354
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:12,919
adding electrical upgrades to that

2355
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:15,110
bedroom that I'm just using in the

2356
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:17,539
winter as a grow space for keeps the

2357
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:20,420
house warm up here actually so I just

2358
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:22,100
run that be using the flip box I can use

2359
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:24,020
that room all the time and have it

2360
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:27,920
flowering constantly and not have any

2361
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:30,560
downtime in that room it's like an 11

2362
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,690
there's like a 14 by 9 room so those two

2363
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,770
5x5 Hut's fit perfectly in there he

2364
01:39:32,689 --> 01:39:35,269
gives me a little bit of room to work

2365
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:36,410
because I really like the girl Hut's a

2366
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:38,719
lot of people talk [ __ ] about him and

2367
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:41,539
hate on him they're amazing it's my

2368
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:44,239
friend that was doing it oh he didn't

2369
01:39:41,539 --> 01:39:46,429
have the flip box but um he had two

2370
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:51,559
different ballast so he was you know one

2371
01:39:46,429 --> 01:39:52,730
was on for 12 hours just he just had the

2372
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,949
extra ballast and I didn't want to go

2373
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:56,209
buy another one

2374
01:39:53,948 --> 01:40:00,979
flipbox is the price of another

2375
01:39:56,210 --> 01:40:02,179
Palestinian it's kind of a test idea I

2376
01:40:00,979 --> 01:40:05,029
wanted to see if I could do that on a

2377
01:40:02,179 --> 01:40:07,250
larger scale because I've designed an 18

2378
01:40:05,029 --> 01:40:09,500
light room that's two nine room or two

2379
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:10,849
nine light rooms on a flip box mm-hmm

2380
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:12,170
and then I actually did some research

2381
01:40:10,849 --> 01:40:14,239
and a guy named Eric

2382
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:16,099
fixa kind of beat me to the punch on

2383
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:19,309
this room that I was trying to build so

2384
01:40:16,099 --> 01:40:21,050
it's a cool room 10 by 10 room with a 10

2385
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,340
by 5 long room in the middle and all of

2386
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:24,650
your equipment is in that middle room

2387
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:26,389
and you cool off to all of the air in

2388
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:27,948
the middle room and one side sleeps so

2389
01:40:26,389 --> 01:40:29,868
you're producing co2 in the sleeping

2390
01:40:27,948 --> 01:40:31,879
plants guys planted or asleep kick off

2391
01:40:29,868 --> 01:40:33,710
co2 if you can vent that co2 into your

2392
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,380
flower room that's awake you can use

2393
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:38,000
that but so yeah you're just you got one

2394
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:39,289
air conditioner one set of ballast one

2395
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,719
dehumidifier and then you're just moving

2396
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:43,340
the air around both rooms killer idea

2397
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:44,569
guys we'll talk about that that's a huge

2398
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:46,639
room that's a lot of money

2399
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:48,948
that's like multi-thousand dollar room

2400
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:50,060
so some of you guys are gonna grow like

2401
01:40:48,948 --> 01:40:51,469
in closets and [ __ ] that's what I'm

2402
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:52,880
saying right so because we can grow and

2403
01:40:51,469 --> 01:40:55,399
grow huts some of you guys might even

2404
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,199
bust out 16 lights in a basement however

2405
01:40:55,399 --> 01:40:59,059
however you do it there will be some

2406
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,039
obstacles presented by your existing

2407
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:02,719
environment that's how it goes unless

2408
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,310
you're building a building that's

2409
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,599
designed to be a gross space from the

2410
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:07,520
beginning you're gonna have to deal with

2411
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:10,730
some type of obstacles that's part of

2412
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:12,440
the fun for me honestly yeah I like

2413
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:14,809
taking a space like a dirty basement or

2414
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:19,039
a funky attic or the back part of the

2415
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:20,420
dispensary and making it grow with the

2416
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:22,310
space and power that I've got without

2417
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:24,289
having to do any crazy dramatic

2418
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:29,030
improvements to the place it's kind of a

2419
01:41:24,289 --> 01:41:32,630
fun challenge I think no I don't think I

2420
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:35,569
know I do upgrades after every single

2421
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:39,920
run sometimes upgrades that slow me down

2422
01:41:35,569 --> 01:41:41,118
quite a bit noticed some down time for a

2423
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,340
minute I've heard you talking about it

2424
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:46,098
alright so let's talk about a few things

2425
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,389
that every grow will need there will be

2426
01:41:46,099 --> 01:41:48,619
more things you're gonna have to add to

2427
01:41:47,389 --> 01:41:51,440
this depending on your room in your

2428
01:41:48,618 --> 01:41:53,719
space but every room is gonna need these

2429
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,158
things this is mostly for just one

2430
01:41:53,719 --> 01:41:57,529
flowering room if you want to have

2431
01:41:55,158 --> 01:41:59,618
plants vegging while your drop flowers

2432
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:01,519
you're gonna need a small bedroom also

2433
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:04,429
eventually you're gonna want a mother

2434
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,949
room and a clone area and a veg area and

2435
01:42:04,429 --> 01:42:07,958
a breeding area and a place

2436
01:42:05,948 --> 01:42:11,799
your mail plants and a place to make

2437
01:42:07,958 --> 01:42:13,269
pollen and it gets ridiculous when you

2438
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,619
start doing it a whole bunch but

2439
01:42:13,269 --> 01:42:17,800
eventually you're gonna want to add more

2440
01:42:14,618 --> 01:42:20,408
rooms my advice is build slowly and plan

2441
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,670
ahead with realistic expectations

2442
01:42:20,408 --> 01:42:23,649
don't start count your chickens before

2443
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:25,479
they hatch if you've got a light and you

2444
01:42:23,649 --> 01:42:26,768
expect a pound of weed start thinking

2445
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:28,929
you got three-quarters of a pound of

2446
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:31,179
weed budget for that because you're not

2447
01:42:28,929 --> 01:42:32,199
gonna grow as great as you plan your

2448
01:42:31,179 --> 01:42:34,510
first couple of runs

2449
01:42:32,198 --> 01:42:36,428
so make your upgrades like Jessie city

2450
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,920
makes upgrades every time kind of plant

2451
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:41,529
them don't go too ambitious your first

2452
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:45,219
couple of times like be realistic about

2453
01:42:41,529 --> 01:42:48,488
it you can fail drops fail things that

2454
01:42:45,219 --> 01:42:50,380
kill crops spider mites air conditioner

2455
01:42:48,488 --> 01:42:51,638
failure if your air conditioner cuts out

2456
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:53,498
in the middle of a flower cycle and

2457
01:42:51,639 --> 01:42:54,729
you're at work and it's 90 degrees

2458
01:42:53,498 --> 01:42:56,139
outside you're gonna come home it's

2459
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:58,090
gonna be 108 degrees in your grow room

2460
01:42:56,139 --> 01:43:01,618
and you're gonna have crispy bugs

2461
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:01,619
they're already dried and cured for

2462
01:43:03,269 --> 01:43:09,539
hydro setup if one pump dies while

2463
01:43:05,948 --> 01:43:09,538
you're at work or while you're asleep

2464
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:14,829
[Music]

2465
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:17,800
mutual friend that went to Las Vegas for

2466
01:43:14,828 --> 01:43:19,090
two days he was he was supposed to go to

2467
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,829
a wedding and didn't want to go but he

2468
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:22,479
had to go and there was like a five-day

2469
01:43:20,828 --> 01:43:23,948
vacation planned but he went for two

2470
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:25,989
days he flew there and flew back right

2471
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:28,448
away and came home and his pump took a

2472
01:43:25,988 --> 01:43:33,428
[ __ ] while he was gone in his whole 4x4

2473
01:43:28,448 --> 01:43:38,669
table yeah we had a double redundancy

2474
01:43:33,429 --> 01:43:41,679
set up you know two pumps and a

2475
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:43,269
dispensary and both filled for the same

2476
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,179
weekend by everyone was that the

2477
01:43:43,269 --> 01:43:48,159
cannabis cup man yeah good bye two

2478
01:43:46,179 --> 01:44:05,380
tables worth of weed two whole tea

2479
01:43:48,158 --> 01:44:06,819
Animas yes thank you good job yeah

2480
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:08,708
everything every grow is gonna need

2481
01:44:06,819 --> 01:44:09,998
electricity right unless you grow it

2482
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:11,458
outside you need electricity

2483
01:44:09,998 --> 01:44:14,228
they're gonna need lights and timers

2484
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:15,849
you'll need intake an outtake fans and

2485
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:17,829
you're going to need a water source

2486
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:21,309
those are the basics that every girl

2487
01:44:17,828 --> 01:44:22,868
will need and we're 40 minutes I'm gonna

2488
01:44:21,309 --> 01:44:24,729
try to squeeze as much of this as we can

2489
01:44:22,868 --> 01:44:32,618
but we might not actually even get to

2490
01:44:24,729 --> 01:44:34,119
like it is just I've had news articles

2491
01:44:32,618 --> 01:44:36,219
set aside I've got a couple of things

2492
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:38,768
Mike and I wanted to talk about it's

2493
01:44:36,219 --> 01:44:40,389
gonna kind of go between these two build

2494
01:44:38,769 --> 01:44:42,369
episodes I think but I might put it out

2495
01:44:40,389 --> 01:44:43,868
as like a midweek episode so I think

2496
01:44:42,368 --> 01:44:45,399
after we record here Mike's gonna come

2497
01:44:43,868 --> 01:44:46,958
over and [ __ ] with me again and talk

2498
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:49,328
about some things so the next one will

2499
01:44:46,958 --> 01:44:50,708
be a news heavy ketchup episode and then

2500
01:44:49,328 --> 01:44:52,688
I'll try to get Jesse back as soon as

2501
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:54,698
possible to talk more about building cuz

2502
01:44:52,689 --> 01:44:58,570
you're gonna send me so many questions I

2503
01:44:54,698 --> 01:44:59,859
can already tell yeah we love the

2504
01:44:58,569 --> 01:45:01,478
questions that means we're doing our job

2505
01:44:59,859 --> 01:45:03,009
if we spark your thoughts that means

2506
01:45:01,479 --> 01:45:05,260
we're doing our job

2507
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:06,849
hey lb you ask me questions and I

2508
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:08,380
appreciate it I hope I responded

2509
01:45:06,849 --> 01:45:09,550
appropriately I don't want to say your

2510
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:11,050
full name because I haven't gotten your

2511
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:12,248
permission but lb I appreciate you for

2512
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:15,429
listening that's awesome

2513
01:45:12,248 --> 01:45:16,779
so lights everybody needs lights lights

2514
01:45:15,429 --> 01:45:17,559
are actually the main ingredient to your

2515
01:45:16,779 --> 01:45:19,719
grow space

2516
01:45:17,559 --> 01:45:21,760
lights dictate the cycles of the gardens

2517
01:45:19,719 --> 01:45:23,739
they tell you if you're in veg or if

2518
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,900
you're in flower lights are also the

2519
01:45:23,738 --> 01:45:28,359
main fuel and energy provider for your

2520
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:31,149
plants lights create photosynthesis

2521
01:45:28,359 --> 01:45:34,630
lights are the main thing number one

2522
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:35,920
nutrient yes put his big of a light as

2523
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:43,328
you can in your space is what I always

2524
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:45,908
say you're gross spaces you will need

2525
01:45:43,328 --> 01:45:47,738
some sort of air exchange system always

2526
01:45:45,908 --> 01:45:51,308
you got to get rid of that old stale

2527
01:45:47,738 --> 01:45:52,958
funky air I can't stress how important

2528
01:45:51,309 --> 01:45:55,329
this is most of the problems I see from

2529
01:45:52,958 --> 01:45:56,788
low-budget grows is a lack of air flow

2530
01:45:55,328 --> 01:45:58,868
and air exchange

2531
01:45:56,788 --> 01:46:01,748
moving the air around the room is great

2532
01:45:58,868 --> 01:46:04,328
but you need to replace the room the air

2533
01:46:01,748 --> 01:46:06,010
in the room also if you leave a freshly

2534
01:46:04,328 --> 01:46:07,359
watered crop locked in a sealed closet

2535
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:09,880
with a light above it you're treating a

2536
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:11,348
very humid environment the plants are

2537
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:13,630
trying to transpire but there's too much

2538
01:46:11,349 --> 01:46:14,969
moisture in there the plants can't sweat

2539
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:17,828
like they should which slows down

2540
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:19,630
photosynthesis and stunts growth it also

2541
01:46:17,828 --> 01:46:21,698
makes your plants look angry and sad too

2542
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:23,109
if the plants were left in excessive

2543
01:46:21,698 --> 01:46:24,908
humidity for long periods they will

2544
01:46:23,109 --> 01:46:28,049
become very susceptible to our good

2545
01:46:24,908 --> 01:46:29,558
friend powdery mildew fu powdery mildew

2546
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:33,458
as

2547
01:46:29,559 --> 01:46:35,319
but grow your risk of powdery mildew way

2548
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:36,608
increases the insides of your buds if

2549
01:46:35,319 --> 01:46:37,809
you're not getting some airflow in there

2550
01:46:36,609 --> 01:46:39,550
and you got too much moisture in the

2551
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:42,788
room that mold is gonna grow right in

2552
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:44,619
the middle of your buds so lock yourself

2553
01:46:42,788 --> 01:46:46,118
in your car one day just lock yourself

2554
01:46:44,618 --> 01:46:47,408
in the car on the Sun and just try to

2555
01:46:46,118 --> 01:46:48,818
sit there and breathe for the whole day

2556
01:46:47,408 --> 01:46:50,138
that's what it feels like for your

2557
01:46:48,819 --> 01:46:53,379
plants when you just stay for one walked

2558
01:46:50,139 --> 01:46:56,139
up in a tight room yeah so we've

2559
01:46:53,378 --> 01:46:59,229
stressed the need for air exchange water

2560
01:46:56,139 --> 01:47:01,059
water should be easily accessible

2561
01:46:59,229 --> 01:47:03,039
I predict that your thought each

2562
01:47:01,059 --> 01:47:04,958
thousand watt light will require about

2563
01:47:03,038 --> 01:47:08,800
five gallons of water two to three times

2564
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:12,729
a week and this works across the board I

2565
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:14,889
like to put sixteen three gallon pots

2566
01:47:12,729 --> 01:47:17,979
under the light or I like to put nine

2567
01:47:14,889 --> 01:47:20,168
five gallon pots or between four and six

2568
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:23,229
seven gallon pots underneath a thousand

2569
01:47:20,168 --> 01:47:25,179
watt light and either way I find that

2570
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:30,088
that requires a byte about five gallons

2571
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:33,069
of water for each watering actually yeah

2572
01:47:30,088 --> 01:47:34,658
I'm glad that works out so keep that in

2573
01:47:33,069 --> 01:47:36,280
mind that you guys are gonna have to get

2574
01:47:34,658 --> 01:47:36,698
water to your gross paste at least twice

2575
01:47:36,279 --> 01:47:39,908
a week

2576
01:47:36,698 --> 01:47:41,799
unless you set up a drip system late in

2577
01:47:39,908 --> 01:47:44,138
Flour and if your room is a little

2578
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:46,119
hotter you may be watering three or four

2579
01:47:44,139 --> 01:47:47,800
times a week I'm hitting my plants is a

2580
01:47:46,118 --> 01:47:49,538
little cool now so I'm hitting a Monday

2581
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:51,189
I hit him with nutrients real heavy and

2582
01:47:49,538 --> 01:47:52,748
then I try to hit him on Thursday or

2583
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:54,999
Friday with just enough water to keep

2584
01:47:52,748 --> 01:47:56,408
him through Monday but since they

2585
01:47:54,998 --> 01:47:57,998
haven't been drinking a lot that means

2586
01:47:56,408 --> 01:47:59,918
it on their next day when they get just

2587
01:47:57,998 --> 01:48:01,118
water I'm gonna really water the [ __ ]

2588
01:47:59,918 --> 01:48:02,828
out of them to kind of wash out any

2589
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:04,838
excess nutrients that have built up over

2590
01:48:02,828 --> 01:48:08,318
time and then we'll start refeeding the

2591
01:48:04,838 --> 01:48:11,338
soil again around day 30 I really bubble

2592
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:11,339
them that's a lot of sugars and things

2593
01:48:12,179 --> 01:48:16,689
water a lot more often to did that Mike

2594

here in this show so thank each and

2609

is awesome yeah thank you guys all right

2611
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:57,340
talked about the very basics of building

2612
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:59,350
a room we talked about setting a goal

2613
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:00,699
for how much cannabis we need to grow I

2614
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:03,699
wrote herb right here about it corrected

2615
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:04,928
myself the next step is figuring out if

2616
01:49:03,698 --> 01:49:07,000
you're building your room to fit your

2617
01:49:04,929 --> 01:49:08,679
production needs or if you're building

2618
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,130
the room to fit the available space

2619
01:49:08,679 --> 01:49:14,050
budget and electrical limitations

2620
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:15,219
sometimes you can't always throw 24

2621
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:17,350
lights in your basement cuz you can't

2622
01:49:15,219 --> 01:49:18,909
pull that many amps so find a happy

2623
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:21,969
medium that lets you draw a few crops

2624
01:49:18,909 --> 01:49:24,099
and then see if this is something that

2625
01:49:21,969 --> 01:49:26,230
you can dedicate more time space and

2626
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:28,860
electricity to and then after a couple

2627
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:30,879
of crops expand your grows plan him out

2628
01:49:28,859 --> 01:49:32,799
but don't expand more quickly than you

2629
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,539
can learn I keep saying that imagine

2630
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,679
this imagine getting ahead of yourself

2631
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:39,039
will cause you headaches in the future

2632
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:41,619
imagine if you have 24 lights in Flour

2633
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:43,840
with six seven gallon pots under each

2634
01:49:41,619 --> 01:49:45,309
light and now you have fungus gnats and

2635
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,360
it's your first growth and you're like

2636
01:49:45,310 --> 01:49:48,250
four weeks in the flower

2637
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:51,519
you can't spray if you spray you're

2638
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:53,679
gonna put [ __ ] in your buds and you got

2639
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:59,320
a whole lot of them you just man if you

2640
01:49:53,679 --> 01:50:01,630
got 24 lights 150 plants that should be

2641
01:49:59,319 --> 01:50:03,189
24 to 30 pounds of weed if you do this

2642
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:07,060
right some guys are gonna get 48 pounds

2643
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:08,738
of weed out of these 24 lights cookies

2644
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:19,870
are hoping for those 25 pounds out of

2645
01:50:08,738 --> 01:50:21,849
that I'm cringing start small dude feel

2646
01:50:19,869 --> 01:50:24,010
small before you feel so large because

2647
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:26,110
when you grow you're gonna fail I mess

2648
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:27,969
up at this rate I still kill stuff on

2649
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:29,439
accident like all the time but that's

2650
01:50:27,969 --> 01:50:30,640
the only way I learn I encourage a

2651
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:31,960
little bit of experiment don't

2652
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:33,850
experiment on your mom's don't

2653
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,010
experiment on your patients important

2654
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:39,850
crop pick a plant torture it see what

2655
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:41,650
you can do to it but go small like

2656
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:43,539
experience a few problems before you try

2657
01:50:41,649 --> 01:50:44,729
to battle fungus gnats in a 24 light

2658
01:50:43,539 --> 01:50:48,090
flower

2659
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:49,500
all right we are 47 minutes in I'm not

2660
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:50,670
sure if we should try to keep going or

2661
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,890
if we should save this next part for

2662
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:54,300
another episode cuz we're uh we kind of

2663
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:57,539
got him on the edge of their seats right

2664
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:59,750
now yeah we'll talk about we'll talk

2665
01:50:57,539 --> 01:51:01,890
about this one spot right here and then

2666
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:04,529
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

2667
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:06,239
row size in relation to how many and

2668
01:51:04,529 --> 01:51:09,329
what type of lights to use we got about

2669
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:12,509
ten minutes to do this so a small closet

2670
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:15,149
set up I would use some small t5 lights

2671
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:18,869
little fluorescent lights I personally

2672
01:51:15,149 --> 01:51:20,159
don't like the coiled CFLs I don't feel

2673
01:51:18,869 --> 01:51:22,439
like they put out enough light they

2674
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:23,939
weren't great as supplements if it's all

2675
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:25,259
you got that's gonna if it's all you've

2676
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:27,029
got and all you can power it's gonna

2677
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,739
work but for the amount of heat that

2678
01:51:27,029 --> 01:51:33,509
they put off I don't think they put off

2679
01:51:28,738 --> 01:51:36,179
enough light for a closet I would almost

2680
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:38,280
recommend it's a t5 light I think there

2681
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:41,909
are eight bulbs and I think it's 24 by

2682
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:44,039
24 is the dimensions of it and I think

2683
01:51:41,909 --> 01:51:45,809
it's actually made by Hydra farm if

2684
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,090
you've got a small closet that is the

2685
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:49,650
perfect light in my opinion if you can't

2686
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:51,449
run a lot of electricity you can put

2687
01:51:49,649 --> 01:51:53,399
that and a small fan and leave the

2688
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:55,229
closet cracked a little bit you've got a

2689
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:56,729
grow room dude as long as you're getting

2690
01:51:55,229 --> 01:51:59,579
that steel air out of there and not

2691
01:51:56,729 --> 01:52:01,139
letting it get too hot keep the those t5

2692
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:03,238
lights right above your plants and then

2693
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:04,739
every night you got to close that closet

2694
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:06,659
door at the same time and turn off your

2695
01:52:04,738 --> 01:52:08,399
light to start your flower cycle and you

2696
01:52:06,659 --> 01:52:10,979
gotta be on the money eight o'clock

2697
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:12,629
eight o'clock every day and night but so

2698
01:52:10,979 --> 01:52:14,009
in a small closet I think that little t5

2699
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:16,170
light I'm talking about is perfect or

2700
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:19,800
maybe a small hid a high-intensity

2701
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:22,529
discharge light maybe like a 150 in a

2702
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:24,449
closet I really like a 250 watt high

2703
01:52:22,529 --> 01:52:26,159
pressure sodium I really find those to

2704
01:52:24,449 --> 01:52:27,809
be efficient those are cool lights it's

2705
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:29,579
a great size light doesn't take a lot of

2706
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:33,840
wattage but it does make a little bit of

2707
01:52:29,579 --> 01:52:37,590
heat even though know if your closets a

2708
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,239
little bigger 400 sir exactly what I was

2709
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:40,739
gonna say a 400 is kind of the biggest

2710
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:42,659
you really want to go in a closet unless

2711
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:45,988
you got like one of those fancy like

2712
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:47,460
bel-air walk-in closets but everyone's

2713
01:52:45,988 --> 01:52:48,929
got a small closet they can dedicate to

2714
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:51,180
a grow space so if you're just trying to

2715
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:52,829
supply herb for you and your girlfriend

2716
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:54,750
or something or your patient just you

2717
01:52:52,829 --> 01:52:56,219
the closet is fine especially with a

2718
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:58,289
little t5 light I think you could pull

2719
01:52:56,219 --> 01:53:08,789
some some stuff out of a t5 is that

2720
01:52:58,289 --> 01:53:10,409
where your first girl was it was more of

2721
01:53:08,789 --> 01:53:13,199
a it was a closet that was actually

2722
01:53:10,409 --> 01:53:15,479
attached to the hot water heater area so

2723
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:18,449
the closet had another door in it and I

2724
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:20,369
actually took the ducting from my hot

2725
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:31,738
water heater and my heater and used some

2726
01:53:20,369 --> 01:53:33,809
of the co2 to my grow room so yeah

2727
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:35,009
perfect little closet it's a great way

2728
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:36,739
to grow you can grow a little short

2729
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:40,409
plants in there you can supply yourself

2730
01:53:36,738 --> 01:53:44,159
a small corner of a room works if you

2731
01:53:40,409 --> 01:53:45,630
need to like tarp off a room or like if

2732
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:47,488
you have a small room that you can just

2733
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:49,500
take the corner you can put a grow Hut

2734
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:50,729
in the corner grow huts are awesome I

2735
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,289
said I'm gonna do a whole talk about

2736
01:53:50,729 --> 01:53:54,569
those that will be another episode guys

2737
01:53:52,289 --> 01:53:55,319
we're at 50 minutes now notice you guys

2738
01:53:54,569 --> 01:53:57,719
don't listen

2739
01:53:55,319 --> 01:54:00,809
past 45 a lot of you listeners click out

2740
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:02,939
at 45 minutes you're drilling of I mean

2741
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:05,789
you're not drilling on this one I mean

2742
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:11,039
it didn't mean a man after after while

2743
01:54:05,789 --> 01:54:12,810
we listen to the show it's like my

2744
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:19,859
throat's done all the listeners are

2745
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:22,560
getting drowsy so you got that small

2746
01:54:19,859 --> 01:54:24,479
corner small space you can put a t5 all

2747
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:27,680
the way up to like a 600 watt light in

2748
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:30,209
like a 6x6 space if you can vent it

2749
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:31,890
we'll talk in the next episode jesse is

2750
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:33,719

2751
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:35,460
house builder manly man so he's gonna

2752
01:54:33,719 --> 01:54:37,409
talk about framing up a space and stuff

2753
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,329
in the next episode we're gonna try to

2754
01:54:37,409 --> 01:54:42,389
get this part done quickly here grow

2755
01:54:39,329 --> 01:54:43,800
huts and we'll talk a lot about them you

2756
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:45,600
can put a grow huh in the corner of any

2757
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:48,750
room you can put multiple grow huts in a

2758
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:50,670
basement you can put one grow Hut in

2759
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:52,529
every role if you've got limited power

2760
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:54,119
find out where each room is on each

2761
01:54:52,529 --> 01:54:55,259
breaker and put one grow huh on each

2762
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:57,329
breaker

2763
01:54:55,260 --> 01:55:03,000
plenty of cannabis in one house or one

2764
01:54:57,329 --> 01:55:04,859
location like this then of course

2765
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,869
there's the whole dedicated bedroom if

2766
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:09,299
you've got a nice bedroom that nobody

2767
01:55:06,869 --> 01:55:11,369
needs if you're a single guy no roommate

2768
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,500
sucks kick him out build a girl room

2769
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:14,519
they won't eat your food he won't bring

2770
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,079
over ugly chicks

2771
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:17,760
you got a grow room in there now that's

2772
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:20,460
gonna produce dank cannabis and it will

2773
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,350
pay for itself something I should write

2774
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:23,850
down to talk about is the cost of

2775
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:33,210
running the grow room because that's

2776
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:36,020
just on my mind it's expensive rooms big

2777
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:41,100
facilities and stuff like that

2778
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:42,480
astronomical if you and I were roommates

2779
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:44,070
and you kicked me out and built a grow

2780
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:46,109
room in my space it would definitely pay

2781
01:55:44,069 --> 01:55:48,079
for itself in the long run oh it

2782
01:55:46,109 --> 01:55:50,719
wouldn't eat your freaking

2783
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:54,510
it would get you high as crap in the end

2784
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:56,100
so a whole room you can put multiple

2785
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:58,380
depending on the size of your room if

2786
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:00,600
you've got so I say like every six by

2787
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:02,039
six four by four four by four two six by

2788
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,770
six space you should put about a

2789
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:05,909
thousand watt light if you can vent it

2790
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:07,890
if you've got a room that's like ten by

2791
01:56:05,909 --> 01:56:09,750
ten I think you should put four thousand

2792
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:11,490
watt lights in there yeah if you're

2793
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:13,529
getting bigger and bigger I it kind of

2794
01:56:11,489 --> 01:56:16,019
depends on your wattage and stuff but

2795
01:56:13,529 --> 01:56:18,269
about every five by five square should

2796
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:21,270
be a thousand watt light if you convince

2797
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:22,800
that I try to leave people hate walkways

2798
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:24,660
a lot of growers say that walkways are

2799
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,640
expensive in a waste of space I like

2800
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:28,680
giving myself a walkway so I can get to

2801
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:30,960
every single plant and I think the

2802
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:32,280
plants like the space to breathe you

2803
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:34,140
don't like being crowded in on the bus

2804
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:35,250
with everybody touching your plants

2805
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:36,869
don't like that [ __ ] either give them

2806
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:38,130
some room to breathe and keeping the

2807
01:56:36,869 --> 01:56:41,340
leaves off of each other will prevent

2808
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:43,109
powdery mildew and places for bugs to

2809
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:46,079
jump around so if you've got a whole

2810
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:48,989
room put up one thousand watt light

2811
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:50,640
every five by five space up to the limit

2812
01:56:48,989 --> 01:56:53,429
that your electricity will allow and

2813
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:55,980
that you can cool here's a random

2814
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:58,230
recommendation I think it's about 3,000

2815
01:56:55,979 --> 01:57:00,299
BTUs of cooling for every single

2816
01:56:58,229 --> 01:57:04,319
thousand watt light is what I think you

2817
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:06,360
want 2500 to 3,000 okay so keep that in

2818
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:08,880
mind when you have to power that air

2819
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:09,170
conditioner also so in your big room

2820
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:13,640
here

2821
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:15,020
if you've got and you're 30 and your to

2822
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:16,820
30 amp breakers you're gonna be able to

2823
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:18,130
run one maybe two lights and an air

2824
01:57:16,819 --> 01:57:21,019
conditioner

2825
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:22,480
that's gonna be about it on the 30 amp

2826
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:24,470
breaker so you're gonna need an

2827
01:57:22,479 --> 01:57:25,969
electrician to come wire up your big

2828
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:28,579
room yeah you're not gonna be able to

2829
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:30,619
get the air conditioner if you've got a

2830
01:57:28,579 --> 01:57:33,319
big garage or a basement you need to

2831
01:57:30,619 --> 01:57:35,119
have the electrician come and wire you

2832
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:37,819
up with 240 in the whole basement and

2833
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:40,760
then you need to have a mini split put

2834
01:57:37,819 --> 01:57:42,649
in the basement and hang like 24 lights

2835
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:48,920
down there in your basement and you have

2836
01:57:42,649 --> 01:57:50,689
an income yeah that many splits gonna be

2837
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:52,369
fun to put in but you can keep it so

2838
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:54,259
cool once you get it there and then the

2839
01:57:52,369 --> 01:57:55,819
next step up from there after you have

2840
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:58,460
your basement or your big garage with

2841
01:57:55,819 --> 01:58:00,739
multiple thousands anything more than

2842
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:03,590
nine lights I think becomes like kind of

2843
01:58:00,739 --> 01:58:04,639
extensive for a home grow yeah yeah if

2844
01:58:03,590 --> 01:58:06,409
you got like ten lights in a house

2845
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:07,880
you're kind of pushing it but then you

2846
01:58:06,409 --> 01:58:09,289
move on to like the commercial scale

2847
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,600
warehouses where you've got multiple

2848
01:58:09,289 --> 01:58:14,180
rooms with multiple thousand watt lights

2849
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:16,520
or one giant room with 100 lights in it

2850
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:18,140
I kind of prefer more separated rooms I

2851
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:19,580
like to breed and if something goes

2852
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:20,990
wrong in one room you don't have it

2853
01:58:19,579 --> 01:58:24,529
everywhere yeah it's a little more

2854
01:58:20,989 --> 01:58:27,409
containable so my main point is playing

2855
01:58:24,529 --> 01:58:28,550
the room before you start building think

2856
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:29,720
about how many lights you want to run

2857
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:32,090
think about how much cannabis you want

2858
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:33,829
to produce I think about your electrical

2859
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:35,390
limitations think about your budget it's

2860
01:58:33,829 --> 01:58:37,789
gonna cost you so we said about a

2861
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:39,619
hundred bucks a month to run a light and

2862
01:58:37,789 --> 01:58:41,560
it's accessories so keep that in mind

2863
01:58:39,619 --> 01:58:43,460
until harvest you're not gonna have

2864
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:45,110
you're gonna have to figure out how to

2865
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:46,569
pay for that once harvest comes then you

2866
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:48,769
obviously have a way to pay for that

2867
01:58:46,569 --> 01:58:50,329
we're gonna be in an hour real quick

2868
01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:52,160
here guys this is a good way to make

2869
01:58:50,329 --> 01:58:54,409
this a two-part episode the part we're

2870
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:56,180
gonna come up with next is actually the

2871
01:58:54,409 --> 01:58:57,680
basic steps to building the room and

2872
01:58:56,180 --> 01:59:00,020
some guidance on building a room and

2873
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:01,520
things to look for I'm gonna cut this

2874
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:04,700
episode off right here and we'll make

2875
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:06,230

iGrow culture podcast I'm your host

Rasta Jeff thanks for joining me for

2925
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:21,800
another episode I'm coming to you today

2926
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:24,739
November 1st the day after Halloween and

2927
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:37,489
I am proud to report that nobody gave

2928
02:01:24,738 --> 02:01:40,039
any trick-or-treaters from Denver

2929
02:01:37,488 --> 02:01:42,799
Associated Press the high headline is

2930
02:01:40,039 --> 02:01:45,529
Halloween pot candy scare baseless so

2931
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:47,389
far the article says police in Colorado

2932
02:01:45,529 --> 02:01:49,399
have warned parents to look out for pot

2933
02:01:47,389 --> 02:01:52,159
laced Halloween candy the parents don't

2934
02:01:49,399 --> 02:01:53,988
seem too worried a denver based testing

2935
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:55,069
company offered a thousand free kits to

2936
02:01:53,988 --> 02:01:56,329
parents wanting to screen their

2937
02:01:55,069 --> 02:01:59,059
trick-or-treaters Hall for marijuana

2938
02:01:56,329 --> 02:02:01,908
psychoactive chemical however only 45

2939
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:04,099
parents took CBC see be scientific up on

2940
02:02:01,908 --> 02:02:05,509
the offer as a Friday there have been no

2941
02:02:04,099 --> 02:02:08,179
reported cases of people slipping

2942
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:10,190
marijuana into unsuspecting unsuspecting

2943
02:02:08,179 --> 02:02:12,889
trick-or-treaters in Colorado or in any

2944
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:14,539
other state but the popularity of pot

2945
02:02:12,889 --> 02:02:16,279
candies in the new retail market in

2946
02:02:14,539 --> 02:02:18,198
Colorado prompted warnings this fall

2947
02:02:16,279 --> 02:02:21,859
from police in Denver Fort Collins and

2948
02:02:18,198 --> 02:02:23,750
Pueblo as of Halloween morning Denver

2949
02:02:21,859 --> 02:02:25,250
police and the Rocky Mountain poison and

2950
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:27,679
drug Center reported no calls about

2951
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:29,929
marijuana and Halloween candy my honest

2952
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:32,000
opinion is that it's an overblown fear

2953
02:02:29,929 --> 02:02:34,849
that was created by the police said CB

2954
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,889
Scientific CEO bill short the company's

2955
02:02:34,849 --> 02:02:38,929
$15 kits are usually used by medical

2956
02:02:36,889 --> 02:02:41,060
marijuana patients to test the potency

2957
02:02:38,929 --> 02:02:42,980
of their weed the kits include small

2958
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:44,840
beakers and a liquid that turns reddish

2959
02:02:42,979 --> 02:02:47,509
in the presence of THC marijuana is

2960
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:49,789
active ingredient I'm gonna jump in here

2961
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:51,440
marijuana does not have ingredients

2962
02:02:49,789 --> 02:02:53,090
marijuana is a plant so you don't need

2963
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:56,299
ingredients to mix it together and make

2964
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:57,739
a plant but nice try sure it said the

2965
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:59,449
free kits were available to parents

2966
02:02:57,738 --> 02:03:01,729
anywhere but that nearly all the

2967
02:02:59,448 --> 02:03:02,928
requests came from Colorado we stepped

2968
02:03:01,729 --> 02:03:04,698
in to tell parents don't be

2969
02:03:02,929 --> 02:03:06,679
spooped they're not trying to jump on

2970
02:03:04,698 --> 02:03:08,928
some fear-mongering bandwagon short set

2971
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:10,670
since January Children's Hospital

2972
02:03:08,929 --> 02:03:12,170
Colorado has reported nine admissions

2973
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:14,359
for children accidentally consuming

2974
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:16,248
edible marijuana it's unclear whether

2975
02:03:14,359 --> 02:03:21,828
those cases were from homemade treats or

2976
02:03:16,248 --> 02:03:23,208
edible marijuana purchased boost

2977
02:03:21,828 --> 02:03:26,299
awareness because of wider availability

2978
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:28,158
of candies the Larimer County Sheriff's

2979
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:30,349
Department for example said in its

2980
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:33,009
warning is necessary because marijuana

2981
02:03:30,349 --> 02:03:35,449
candies don't necessarily appear unusual

2982
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:37,070
THC infused edibles are often designed

2983
02:03:35,448 --> 02:03:39,248
to look very similar to popular

2984
02:03:37,069 --> 02:03:41,328
name-brand treats the office warned in

2985
02:03:39,248 --> 02:03:42,800
Washington State the other state with

2986
02:03:41,328 --> 02:03:44,420
legal sorry I'm gonna start that

2987
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,829
sentence over again in Washington State

2988
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:47,689
the only other state with legal

2989
02:03:45,828 --> 02:03:50,208
recreational pot sales authorities have

2990
02:03:47,689 --> 02:03:51,920
been more circumspect a sheriff's

2991
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:54,170
detective in Pierce County Washington

2992
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:56,090
wrote a newspaper column saying pot

2993
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:59,649
showing up in trick-or-treat bags is an

2994
02:03:56,090 --> 02:04:08,199
urban myth it's too expensive

2995
02:03:59,649 --> 02:04:08,198
sorry terrifying in nature that was

2996
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:14,729
[Music]

2997
02:04:18,099 --> 02:04:37,219
terrifying in the people we don't want

2998
02:04:35,899 --> 02:04:39,948
to play tricks on people we don't want

2999
02:04:37,219 --> 02:04:41,420
to give people cannabis and I think most

3000
02:04:39,948 --> 02:04:46,509
of us have realized that if we do that

3001
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:46,510
we are fighting down our own movement so

3002
02:04:46,809 --> 02:04:51,860
any cannabis infused candies over

3003
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:53,389
Halloween by the point is that that's a

3004
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,738
lot of hype and a lot of fear so if you

3005
02:04:53,389 --> 02:04:57,708
guys are believing that relax a little

3006
02:04:54,738 --> 02:05:00,018
bit it's not as big of a fear as we

3007
02:04:57,708 --> 02:05:04,038
thought it was everybody had a happy and

3008
02:05:00,019 --> 02:05:05,510
safe Halloween I am going to continue

3009
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:06,978
with this next news article then we'll

3010
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:08,929
do a couple of ads this one's kind of

3011
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:11,150
related part of that article that I just

3012
02:05:08,929 --> 02:05:13,479
read said that a lot of edibles are

3013
02:05:11,149 --> 02:05:15,469
designed to look like popular candies

3014
02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:17,539
but no more

3015
02:05:15,469 --> 02:05:19,519
this article comes from the Denver Post

3016
02:05:17,538 --> 02:05:22,189
and it is written by David McCoy uh

3017
02:05:19,519 --> 02:05:24,650
the headline says gone to join no more

3018
02:05:22,189 --> 02:05:25,069
Colorado edibles firm settle suit over

3019
02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:28,848
Hershey

3020
02:05:25,069 --> 02:05:30,590
lookalikes article says the small

3021
02:05:28,849 --> 02:05:32,779
Colorado Springs based producer of

3022
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:34,510
marijuana edibles sued in June by candy

3023
02:05:32,779 --> 02:05:36,948
giant the Hershey Company for allegedly

3024
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:38,659
breaching a number of design and named

3025
02:05:36,948 --> 02:05:40,908
patents quietly settles the dispute

3026
02:05:38,658 --> 02:05:42,618
settlement pending late September

3027
02:05:40,908 --> 02:05:44,509
teacher Bell agreed to recall and

3028
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:45,978
destroy all edibles it's sold that looks

3029
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:50,710
like the famed chocolate company's

3030
02:05:45,979 --> 02:05:50,710
products or with names on their brands

3031
02:05:55,868 --> 02:06:00,618
such as Reese's almond joy and Heath

3032
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,360
long before the federal lawsuit was

3033
02:06:00,618 --> 02:06:04,279
filed in June in US District Court in

3034
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:06,679
Denver the settlement makes sure it

3035
02:06:04,279 --> 02:06:08,719
won't happen again so these guys were

3036
02:06:06,679 --> 02:06:11,389
making edibles and some of them were

3037
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:13,309
delicious dude they make a reefers

3038
02:06:11,389 --> 02:06:14,809
peanut butter bar that looks just like

3039
02:06:13,309 --> 02:06:17,389
the Reese's peanut butter bar but it

3040
02:06:14,809 --> 02:06:19,699
says reefers on it the packaging was the

3041
02:06:17,389 --> 02:06:22,219
same color as the Reese's peanut butter

3042
02:06:19,698 --> 02:06:24,109
cups it looked very similar so I could

3043
02:06:22,219 --> 02:06:27,739
see why first she's kind of got pissed

3044
02:06:24,109 --> 02:06:30,978
at this the heath was I forgot they

3045
02:06:27,738 --> 02:06:33,678
called the heath bar but these candy

3046
02:06:30,979 --> 02:06:34,820
bars look just like the original candy

3047
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:36,019
bar and that could cause a problem I

3048
02:06:34,819 --> 02:06:38,389
could see that if your kid saw that

3049
02:06:36,019 --> 02:06:39,769
sitting on the counter which should not

3050
02:06:38,389 --> 02:06:42,409
be sitting out for a kid to get but if

3051
02:06:39,769 --> 02:06:44,479
he saw that reefers bar sitting up there

3052
02:06:42,408 --> 02:06:54,259
the kid would probably eat it and that

3053
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:56,239
kid would be also requires team Chevelle

3054
02:06:54,260 --> 02:07:00,590
not to use the product names hash ease

3055
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:03,259
ganja joy hash hash sheets thingamajiggy

3056
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:04,998
or and reefers nor to use the name

3057
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:06,710
reefer for any candies that contain

3058
02:07:04,998 --> 02:07:10,340
either peanut butter or its flavorings

3059
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:11,960
the company also agreed not not to make

3060
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:14,239
packages with brown yellow and orange

3061
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:15,590
colors which are those used by Reese's

3062
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:16,648
brand according to a copy of the

3063
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:18,300
statement

3064
02:07:16,649 --> 02:07:20,249
so now they can't even use any of the

3065
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:21,659
colors her she pretty much cock-blocked

3066
02:07:20,248 --> 02:07:24,628
these guys pretty well from doing

3067
02:07:21,658 --> 02:07:26,188
anything like that her she's n her she's

3068
02:07:24,628 --> 02:07:27,689
had said Tinkerbell's products harmed

3069
02:07:26,189 --> 02:07:29,789
their brand name and could be confused

3070
02:07:27,689 --> 02:07:31,769
for regular candy by children which is

3071
02:07:29,788 --> 02:07:33,389
kind of what I was saying a Tinkerbell

3072
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:35,189
neither admitted nor denied any

3073
02:07:33,389 --> 02:07:37,109

3200
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:04,370
activity but a spokesman for the

3201
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:05,960
department later said he did not know if

3202
02:14:04,369 --> 02:14:07,729
the operations raided were licensed

3203
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:10,489
marijuana businesses or if detectives

3204
02:14:07,729 --> 02:14:12,649
believe they were exclusively illegal

3205
02:14:10,488 --> 02:14:14,869
the police did not announce any arrests

3206
02:14:12,649 --> 02:14:16,849
connected to the raids this boat's woman

3207

businesses refused to comment on whether

3210
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,579
the division was involved in the

3211
02:14:21,649 --> 02:14:25,579
investigation

3212

3215
02:14:29,449 --> 02:14:36,260

is in an industrial area popular with

3225
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:57,949
state legal commercial marijuana growers

3226
02:14:55,640 --> 02:15:01,820
and increasingly illegal growers trying

3227
02:14:57,949 --> 02:15:03,199
to hide among them to the grow operation

3228
02:15:01,819 --> 02:15:09,229
for a medical marijuana products

3229
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:10,519
business state records show industry

3230
02:15:09,229 --> 02:15:12,468
insiders said they believe the address

3231
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:13,820
is now occupied by people claiming to be

3232
02:15:12,469 --> 02:15:15,800
medical marijuana caregivers

3233
02:15:13,819 --> 02:15:18,590
smaller-scale providers that operate

3234
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:20,210
west a neighboring cannabis business

3235
02:15:18,590 --> 02:15:23,170
employees were bewildered by the flurry

3236
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:25,850
of police activity Nate Perini who works

3237
02:15:23,170 --> 02:15:27,380
edibles manufacturer and appear which is

3238
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:28,989
next door to the raided operation on

3239
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:31,279
North Bryan Street said cops already

3240
02:15:28,988 --> 02:15:33,379
were there when she got to work around

3241
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:40,309
9:00 a.m. yeah they're getting raided

3242
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:41,630
she said there was a house in my

3243
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:48,200
neighborhood a few weeks ago there were

3244
02:15:41,630 --> 02:15:50,539
just like a block away such a weird

3245
02:15:48,199 --> 02:15:51,800
feeling anyway a police car was parked

3246
02:15:50,539 --> 02:15:54,350
in front of the shop and another was

3247
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:56,719
parked in the alley behind it police had

3248
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:58,850
been strung around the perimeter Tuesday

3249
02:15:56,719 --> 02:16:00,409
Tuesday's raids came 11 months after

3250
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:03,020
local and federal authorities raided

3251
02:16:00,409 --> 02:16:05,079
several large marijuana businesses the

3252
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:07,430
largest raids on Colorado pot businesses

3253
02:16:05,079 --> 02:16:09,380
excuse me since medical marijuana became

3254
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:11,659
legal for people connected to the

3255
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:13,730
businesses raided then have been charged

3256
02:16:11,659 --> 02:16:15,649
with federal crimes and prosecutors have

3257
02:16:13,729 --> 02:16:20,209
also moved the seized businesses have

3258
02:16:15,649 --> 02:16:22,879
moved to seize the business's assets so

3259
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:24,469
I don't from what I have read and seen

3260
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:28,369
recently and what's going on on Facebook

3261
02:16:24,469 --> 02:16:30,649
these facilities were not legal medical

3262
02:16:28,369 --> 02:16:33,829
marijuana Emmie deregistered facilities

3263
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:36,138
these were caregivers who have kind of

3264
02:16:33,829 --> 02:16:37,849
vague rules but they were probably out

3265
02:16:36,138 --> 02:16:39,409
of their plant count and if they had

3266
02:16:37,849 --> 02:16:40,370
that much money on them they were doing

3267
02:16:39,409 --> 02:16:53,420
something that they shouldn't have been

3268
02:16:40,370 --> 02:16:55,400
doing on Facebook at least so we're like

3269
02:16:53,420 --> 02:16:57,200
the warehouse right here got raided in

3270
02:16:55,399 --> 02:17:01,879
the one right next to it did not and the

3271
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:03,590
one on the other side of it did not you

3272
02:17:01,879 --> 02:17:06,439
see all these federal agents and hazmat

3273
02:17:03,590 --> 02:17:08,058
suits pull up and just start taking [ __ ]

3274
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:21,260
apart and they come in with guns blazing

3275
02:17:08,058 --> 02:17:24,079
I'm sure business next door what you're

3276
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:25,610
waiting for anymore oh man but from what

3277
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:28,370
I've seen these places were not legal so

3278
02:17:25,610 --> 02:17:30,739
this wasn't the feds taking down medical

3279
02:17:28,370 --> 02:17:32,870
marijuana facilities this was actual

3280
02:17:30,739 --> 02:17:34,549
raids on illegal gross and I know that

3281
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:36,050
sounds weird being in Colorado but there

3282
02:17:34,549 --> 02:17:51,109
are a lot of these large-scale illegal

3283
02:17:36,049 --> 02:17:52,819
crows going on toke of the town guys

3284
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:54,409
look at the cannabis the toke of the

3285
02:17:52,819 --> 02:17:57,739
town I look at a lot of websites to find

3286
02:17:54,409 --> 02:17:59,360
my cannabis news unfortunately you have

3287
02:17:57,739 --> 02:18:00,829
to type in the word marijuana to find

3288
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:03,170
good cannabis news I'm trying to change

3289
02:18:00,829 --> 02:18:05,360
that here's a reminder marijuana is a

3290
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:08,120
racist word it was created with racism

3291
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:09,860
it supports a racist connotation so

3292
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:12,380
we're gonna stop saying marijuana and

3293
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:14,359
let's all say cannabis cannabis is the

3294
02:18:12,379 --> 02:18:16,489
revolutionary term

3295
02:18:14,359 --> 02:18:17,809
the people before us the older folks are

3296
02:18:16,489 --> 02:18:19,489
afraid of marijuana they're not as

3297
02:18:17,808 --> 02:18:21,318
afraid of cannabis we've kind of it's

3298
02:18:19,489 --> 02:18:23,148
all about the words if you say the right

3299
02:18:21,318 --> 02:18:24,799
words you can convince people just about

3300
02:18:23,148 --> 02:18:27,978
anything so let's start saying cannabis

3301
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:30,679
not saying marijuana the headline of

3302
02:18:27,978 --> 02:18:32,510
this article Georgia drug agents bust

3303
02:18:30,679 --> 02:18:34,519
man with okra and believe it is

3304
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:36,079
marijuana it's kind of an old story you

3305
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:40,309
guys might have heard about it from Mike

3306
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:43,129
Adams the article says this is really

3307
02:18:40,308 --> 02:18:45,409
might summarize some of this Americans

3308
02:18:43,129 --> 02:18:47,000
are no longer safe to cultivate common

3309
02:18:45,409 --> 02:18:52,099
garden vegetables without risking the

3310
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:53,989
violent wrath of the drug war Georgia

3311
02:18:52,099 --> 02:18:56,058
resident Dwayne Perry who told reporters

3312
02:18:53,989 --> 02:18:57,679
that he was raided by drug agents

3313
02:18:56,058 --> 02:18:59,750
earlier last week after an aerial

3314
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:03,019
surveillance unit mistook his Oprah crop

3315
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:04,670
for marijuana that's right it appears as

3316
02:19:03,019 --> 02:19:06,109
though Georgia law enforcement has not

3317
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:08,808
had enough experience taking down

3318
02:19:06,109 --> 02:19:10,729
marijuana grow operations to distinguish

3319
02:19:08,808 --> 02:19:12,590
the difference between okra and the

3320
02:19:10,728 --> 02:19:16,489
cannabis plant dude there is a picture

3321
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:29,510
of an okra plant here does not look at

3322
02:19:16,489 --> 02:19:31,818
all like to train these guys a little

3323
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:33,290
more so I'm gonna summarize this article

3324
02:19:31,818 --> 02:19:35,299
reports indicate that a Drug Task Force

3325
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:37,040
was conducting a marijuana suppression

3326
02:19:35,299 --> 02:19:38,659
mission when officers spotted Perry's

3327
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,700
okra plants and immediately thought he

3328
02:19:38,659 --> 02:19:43,039
was growing weed okra plants

3329
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:44,719
incidentally consists of five fat leaves

3330
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:47,359
while the cannabis plant has very

3331
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:49,369
distinguishable foil eat foliage it

3332
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:58,030
smelled foil across foliage wrong here

3333
02:19:49,370 --> 02:20:00,200
they put foi o absolutely nothing alike

3334
02:19:58,030 --> 02:20:02,149
unfortunately that did not stop officers

3335
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:05,569
with Georgia State Patrol from swooping

3336
02:20:02,148 --> 02:20:07,219
in on Perry's residence dressed to kill

3337
02:20:05,568 --> 02:20:08,809
is what it says here an attempt to

3338
02:20:07,219 --> 02:20:10,579
destroy the suspected marijuana growing

3339
02:20:08,809 --> 02:20:12,379
in his backyard they were strapped to

3340
02:20:10,579 --> 02:20:13,789
the gills said Perry explaining to

3341
02:20:12,379 --> 02:20:15,409
reporters how the officers seemed

3342
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:17,600
prepared to shoot him dead on the spot

3343
02:20:15,409 --> 02:20:20,299
over a case of mistaken identity

3344
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:23,449
oh man these cops went in and raided

3345
02:20:20,299 --> 02:20:25,488
this guy imagine would you get raided

3346
02:20:23,449 --> 02:20:27,260
it's traumatic I've been involved in a

3347
02:20:25,488 --> 02:20:29,600
couple of raids unfortunately knock on

3348
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:34,459
wood I'm never in one of those again the

3349
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:39,078
cops 47 you could have a bomb you could

3350
02:20:34,459 --> 02:20:46,100
have dogs you could be crazy as [ __ ] for

3351
02:20:39,078 --> 02:20:47,359
whatever you're doing in there if you're

3352
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:48,588
doing some kind of crime rent a house

3353
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:49,998
where there's some shoes going on you

3354
02:20:48,588 --> 02:20:54,439
might expect that he might be the type

3355
02:20:49,998 --> 02:20:58,369
of person that's prepared for that this

3356
02:20:54,439 --> 02:21:01,248
dude is a grower in Georgia I'm pretty

3357
02:20:58,369 --> 02:21:03,050
sure he's not experienced with the SWAT

3358
02:21:01,248 --> 02:21:04,338
team in the State Patrol so he probably

3359
02:21:03,049 --> 02:21:06,469
should his pants when they came in

3360
02:21:04,338 --> 02:21:20,029
probably traumatized him probably

3361
02:21:06,469 --> 02:21:22,698
traumatized his family kids there's no

3362
02:21:20,029 --> 02:21:25,220
excuse for this domestic warfare over a

3363
02:21:22,699 --> 02:21:27,379
plant there I am at home and retired and

3364
02:21:25,219 --> 02:21:29,088
you know I do the right thing said Terry

3365
02:21:27,379 --> 02:21:31,930
they come to my house strapped with

3366
02:21:29,088 --> 02:21:34,369
weapons for no reason it ain't right

3367
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:36,199
several officers did apologize after

3368
02:21:34,369 --> 02:21:37,970
further investigating the plants but

3369
02:21:36,199 --> 02:21:39,680
that simply isn't good enough says Perry

3370
02:21:37,969 --> 02:21:40,938
because the situation could have

3371
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:43,010
potentially gotten him killed or

3372
02:21:40,939 --> 02:21:44,289
seriously injured more I thought about

3373
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:47,139
it what could have happened he said

3374
02:21:44,289 --> 02:21:48,399
anything could have happened that

3375
02:21:47,139 --> 02:21:54,858
article

3376
02:21:48,398 --> 02:21:56,478
good job was a good way to spend your

3377
02:21:54,859 --> 02:21:58,748
money but you scared the [ __ ] out of

3378
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:00,889
this old retired guy for no reason

3379
02:21:58,748 --> 02:22:02,418
instead of making friends the cops keep

3380
02:22:00,889 --> 02:22:04,430
making more enemies by doing [ __ ] like

3381
02:22:02,418 --> 02:22:05,658
this if you put down your guns and quit

3382
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:07,158
trying to be soldiers and just be

3383
02:22:05,658 --> 02:22:09,199
friends and police the community like we

3384
02:22:07,158 --> 02:22:10,639
design the police for you'd have a lot

3385
02:22:09,199 --> 02:22:12,770
more damn friends I think

3386
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:14,658
and then when [ __ ] goes wrong the cops

3387
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:16,459
would have somebody to talk to they

3388
02:22:14,658 --> 02:22:18,078
wouldn't have to like was wrong now

3389
02:22:16,459 --> 02:22:19,159
everybody disappears nobody wants to

3390
02:22:18,078 --> 02:22:21,020
talk to the cops

3391
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:22,851
cops are the bad guy now here's a good

3392
02:22:21,021 --> 02:22:25,811
guy still we'd want to talk to you

3393
02:22:22,851 --> 02:22:25,810
because we know you'd help us

3394
02:22:29,309 --> 02:22:33,458
[Music]

3395
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:40,250
this is a ridiculous article I saw this

3396
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:41,630
unfold on Facebook this was highly

3397
02:22:40,250 --> 02:22:43,579
entertaining this story is a little bit

3398
02:22:41,629 --> 02:22:44,869
old but it's worth talking about we

3399
02:22:43,579 --> 02:22:46,190
haven't done any news on the show for a

3400
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:48,950
while we've been tacking up such great

3401
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:51,800
shows here's a funny article this one is

3402
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:54,110
by William breeds the article is

3403
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:56,810
headlined idiot allegedly rips off pop

3404
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:58,940
grow leaves cellphone behind we had a

3405
02:22:56,810 --> 02:23:03,079
lot of fun with this money guys this guy

3406
02:22:58,940 --> 02:23:04,640
named Chris Mathers from Colorado I'll

3407
02:23:03,079 --> 02:23:06,771
just read the story Chris Mathers is

3408
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:08,299
apparently a thief but not a good one we

3409
02:23:06,771 --> 02:23:09,920
know this because the junkie scumbag

3410
02:23:08,299 --> 02:23:11,390
left his smartphone behind earlier this

3411
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:14,690
week while allegedly ripping off a

3412
02:23:11,390 --> 02:23:17,090
colorado growers outdoor garden one of

3413
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:18,710
several he's allegedly burglarized now

3414
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:21,440
thanks to social media he's got the

3415
02:23:18,709 --> 02:23:24,109
attention of local police see this

3416
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:25,610
mastermind Mathers unlocked which

3417
02:23:24,110 --> 02:23:27,829
allowed the victim to pull up more than

3418
02:23:25,610 --> 02:23:29,569
enough information on the scumbag to

3419
02:23:27,829 --> 02:23:32,569
track him down and eventually get the

3420
02:23:29,569 --> 02:23:33,920
cops involved details are hazy mostly to

3421
02:23:32,569 --> 02:23:36,409
keep the growers identity identity

3422
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,640
somewhat discreet but after getting over

3423
02:23:36,409 --> 02:23:39,649
the initial horror of seeing their

3424
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:42,199
harvest still weeks from being finished

3425
02:23:39,649 --> 02:23:43,909
gone the owners of the drug were no

3426
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:45,800
doubt elated to find some rather

3427
02:23:43,909 --> 02:23:47,719
concrete evidence leaking matters to

3428
02:23:45,799 --> 02:23:52,310
their grow no word on how Mathers would

3429
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:54,289
even know about the grow it says the guy

3430
02:23:52,310 --> 02:23:56,329
left his phone his cell phone open for

3431
02:23:54,290 --> 02:23:58,280
anyone to use the grower handed things

3432
02:23:56,329 --> 02:24:01,250
over to the social media there's a post

3433
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:03,230
from one of the growers friends it says

3434
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:04,670
my friends out door was ripped last

3435
02:24:03,229 --> 02:24:06,409
night one of the rippers dropped his

3436
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:08,840
phone I'm gonna post his profile below

3437
02:24:06,409 --> 02:24:10,489
and his buddy that was involved found

3438
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:12,319
out through reading messages please hit

3439
02:24:10,489 --> 02:24:13,129
me up if you know them and quickly it

3440
02:24:12,319 --> 02:24:15,799
escalated

3441
02:24:13,129 --> 02:24:18,020
I actually saw these posts on Facebook

3442
02:24:15,799 --> 02:24:20,029
and it was really it was like it's like

3443
02:24:18,021 --> 02:24:23,200
watching a real soap opera or a reality

3444
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:26,409
show happen on Facebook all day

3445
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:28,720
so it says the victim pulled photos of a

3446
02:24:26,409 --> 02:24:30,879
passed-out Mathers his address phone

3447
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:33,219
number and even a list of other grow-ops

3448
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:35,379
he's allegedly ripped off while the

3449
02:24:33,219 --> 02:24:36,549
growers no doubt had the inclination to

3450
02:24:35,379 --> 02:24:39,039
go beat his head in

3451
02:24:36,549 --> 02:24:41,139
they wisely called the cops after all

3452
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:44,729
pot is a legal thing to grow in this

3453
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:46,959
state and this is outright theft so

3454
02:24:44,728 --> 02:24:48,219
there was a lot of talk on Facebook

3455
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:49,869
about people just going and whipping

3456
02:24:48,219 --> 02:24:51,549
this guy's ass because we had his home

3457
02:24:49,870 --> 02:24:54,750
phone number we had his address we knew

3458
02:24:51,549 --> 02:24:57,969
all of his friends he was in deep [ __ ]

3459
02:24:54,750 --> 02:25:00,250
but like this article says it's legal to

3460
02:24:57,969 --> 02:25:03,519
have cannabis in this state so they

3461
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:05,319
called the cops this guy was arrested

3462
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,750
for this but let's read article says for

3463
02:25:05,319 --> 02:25:09,430
his part Mather sounds like he's near

3464
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:11,350
rock bottom the grower was able to pull

3465
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:19,470
a text message conversations about met

3466

3468
02:25:22,209 --> 02:25:25,449

3469
02:25:23,739 --> 02:25:26,739

02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:46,720
his cell phone behind people had a lot

3475

him and a lot of his friends all day

3478
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:56,530
long until he took down his entire

3479
02:25:53,649 --> 02:25:58,090
Facebook page in the end he did end up

3480
02:25:56,530 --> 02:26:00,370
getting arrested for stealing this crop

3481
02:25:58,090 --> 02:26:06,100

tastes delicious

3525
02:28:08,329 --> 02:28:13,350
okay now let's read this crazy article

3526
02:28:11,790 --> 02:28:15,090
this other are this articles once again

3527
02:28:13,350 --> 02:28:27,870
by our good friend William breeds I

3528
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:29,909
found this article on the of the town to

3529
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:32,370
pay attention governor candidate wants

3530
02:28:29,909 --> 02:28:35,909
to shoot wolves because Coloradans smoke

3531
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:37,890
weed I'm gonna say that again Wyoming

3532
02:28:35,909 --> 02:28:42,059
governor candidate wants to shoot wolves

3533
02:28:37,889 --> 02:28:44,879
because Coloradans smoke weed article

3534
02:28:42,059 --> 02:28:46,680
says Don Willis wants to kill wolves he

3535
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:48,839
also wants to be governor right now he's

3536
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:50,309
all about killing him some wolves so

3537
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:51,568
much so that he's made it part of his

3538
02:28:50,309 --> 02:28:54,090
campaign strategy

3539
02:28:51,568 --> 02:28:55,829
see Wyoming has permitted wolf funds in

3540
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:57,779
the past but this year a federal judge

3541
02:28:55,829 --> 02:29:00,659
put the animals if he component to the

3542
02:28:57,779 --> 02:29:02,700
water ecosystem on a protected list that

3543
02:29:00,659 --> 02:29:08,700
pisses off Willis who has previously

3544
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:10,859
noted just wants wolves to die despite

3545
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:13,439
federal protection because Colorado has

3546
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:15,300
legal weed the wolf tags have been

3547
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:17,550
issued and hunters had already made

3548
02:29:15,299 --> 02:29:19,469
plans to start their hunts he said the

3549
02:29:17,549 --> 02:29:21,659
disruption to hunters Outfitters and the

3550
02:29:19,469 --> 02:29:23,699
cost Wyoming Game and Fish to refund

3551
02:29:21,659 --> 02:29:25,978
hunting permits caused by a single

3552
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:27,779
black-robe judge who sits in Washington

3553
02:29:25,978 --> 02:29:30,358
DC and has probably never been in

3554
02:29:27,779 --> 02:29:32,970
Wyoming is outrageous and should be

3555
02:29:30,359 --> 02:29:34,800
defied by Wyoming yes apparently you

3556
02:29:32,969 --> 02:29:36,299
live in you have to live in Wyoming to

3557
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:38,728
actually care about Wyoming's wolf

3558
02:29:36,299 --> 02:29:40,528
population well this is now calling on

3559
02:29:38,728 --> 02:29:43,858
hunters to go ahead and disobey the

3560
02:29:40,529 --> 02:29:46,319
federal order Colorado did just that in

3561
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:48,420
the legalization of pot it's a federal

3562
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:50,549
crime to commit commercially grow pot

3563
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:52,529
and the state of Colorado's defied the

3564
02:29:50,549 --> 02:29:54,568
federal laws and it all worked out fun

3565
02:29:52,529 --> 02:29:56,760
he told the Billings Gazette both

3566
02:29:54,568 --> 02:29:58,379
carefully pointing out that he doesn't

3567
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:00,300
think people should break federal law to

3568
02:29:58,379 --> 02:30:03,119
use cannabis nor was he endorsing

3569
02:30:00,299 --> 02:30:05,039
cannabis use he also taunted the US Fish

3570
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:06,240
and Wildlife Service saying he doubted

3571
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:08,399
they would enforce the judge's ruling

3572
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:09,639
because they normally side with Wyoming

3573
02:30:08,398 --> 02:30:11,590
on such matters

3574
02:30:09,639 --> 02:30:13,868
current wyoming Governor Matt Mead

3575
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:16,029
agreed that the hunt should go on but

3576
02:30:13,869 --> 02:30:18,189
stopped short of advocating advocating

3577
02:30:16,029 --> 02:30:21,039
people's disobey the federal protections

3578
02:30:18,189 --> 02:30:23,970
on animals which are purely shot for

3579
02:30:21,039 --> 02:30:26,560
trophy they do shoot wolves for trophy

3580
02:30:23,969 --> 02:30:28,840
Wyoming is successfully negotiated

3581
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,148
against federal overreach and when

3582
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:33,818
necessary they've gone to court he said

3583
02:30:31,148 --> 02:30:36,099
in a release I do not advocate taking an

3584
02:30:33,818 --> 02:30:37,988
extreme stand doomed to failure which

3585
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:40,418
undermines Wyoming's interests instead

3586
02:30:37,988 --> 02:30:41,618
of moving forward article goes on to say

3587
02:30:40,418 --> 02:30:43,510
that they are going to pretty much

3588
02:30:41,619 --> 02:30:53,619
monitor the amount of wolves and then

3589
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:55,449
they will doing [ __ ] so let's shoot our

3590
02:30:53,619 --> 02:30:58,300
wolves in Wyoming I bet the feds won't

3591
02:30:55,449 --> 02:31:01,479
do [ __ ] I'm curious to see how that

3592
02:30:58,299 --> 02:31:03,849
turns out that's coming up so uh I might

3593
02:31:01,478 --> 02:31:07,328
pay attention to that chances are I will

3594
02:31:03,850 --> 02:31:09,399
forget all about that one thing I won't

3595
02:31:07,328 --> 02:31:11,408

3617
02:31:50,590 --> 02:31:55,289
congressman urges Oregon to follow his

3618
02:31:53,078 --> 02:31:57,788

3624
02:32:07,658 --> 02:32:12,520
said in an op-ed Friday that marijuana

3625
02:32:10,748 --> 02:32:14,949
legalization is sound policy and he

3626
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:17,140
urged Oregonians to follow in Colorado's

3627
02:32:14,949 --> 02:32:19,500
footsteps and vote YES on recreational

3628
02:32:17,139 --> 02:32:20,909
marijuana in next week's election

3629
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,620
Colorado is approaching the first

3630
02:32:20,909 --> 02:32:24,750
anniversary of legally regulated

3631
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:28,110
recreational marijuana for adults Poulos

3632
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:30,239
wrote in the Bend bulletin the

3633
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:32,220
implementation of our new laws has gone

3634
02:32:30,239 --> 02:32:34,680
smoothly over all providing an excellent

3635
02:32:32,219 --> 02:32:36,209
example for other states to follow our

3636
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:38,399
success has made it clear that when

3637
02:32:36,209 --> 02:32:40,739
marijuana is regulated like alcohol it

3638
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:43,139
can decrease crime help fund schools and

3639
02:32:40,739 --> 02:32:44,579
drug education programs and keep money

3640
02:32:43,139 --> 02:32:49,469
out of the hands of criminals and

3641
02:32:44,579 --> 02:32:51,780
cartels voters are considering measure

3642
02:32:49,469 --> 02:32:53,699
91 which would allow adults to possess

3643
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:56,460
up to eight ounces of marijuana at home

3644
02:32:53,700 --> 02:32:59,430
and up to one ounce in public taxes on

3645
02:32:56,459 --> 02:33:01,109
marijuana sales with schools law

3646
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:03,569
enforcement and drug prevention and

3647
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:04,710
education programs while Oregon while

3648
02:33:03,569 --> 02:33:07,729
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission

3649
02:33:04,709 --> 02:33:11,000
would regulate and monitor the industry

3650
02:33:07,729 --> 02:33:13,289
sounds like it makes sense let's do it

3651
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,120
decide whether to join Colorado and

3652
02:33:13,290 --> 02:33:17,550
Washington and regulating marijuana like

3653
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,860
alcohol wrote Paulus who previously

3654
02:33:17,549 --> 02:33:22,139
sponsored legislation that would do just

3655
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:24,210
that at the federal level more than ever

3656
02:33:22,139 --> 02:33:25,859
I believe it's time to change course on

3657
02:33:24,209 --> 02:33:28,709
decades of failed marijuana prohibition

3658
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:30,630
and demonstrate viable effective

3659
02:33:28,709 --> 02:33:32,869
alternatives to address the realities of

3660
02:33:30,629 --> 02:33:35,609
marijuana today

3661
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:37,980
Colorado's Colorado voters legalized

3662
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:39,989
recreational marijuana in 2012 with the

3663
02:33:37,979 --> 02:33:42,539
first sales beginning on New Year's Day

3664
02:33:39,989 --> 02:33:44,190
2014 guys I don't know if I've mentioned

3665
02:33:42,540 --> 02:33:46,200
this on the show before I'm sure I

3666
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:48,000
haven't been a smartass I was the first

3667
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,380
guy to buy recreational cannabis at the

3668
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:52,799
greener side dispensary in Pueblo

3669
02:33:49,379 --> 02:33:54,839
Colorado I got there like five forty six

3670
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:57,420
o'clock in the morning and sat in line

3671
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:59,250
and bought weed first and one of my good

3672
02:33:57,420 --> 02:34:01,590
friends dispensaries kinda made me proud

3673
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:03,989
anyway while the rollout of the new

3674
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:06,210
regulatory regime has been has not been

3675
02:34:03,989 --> 02:34:08,610
perfect it has largely been deemed a

3676
02:34:06,209 --> 02:34:10,829
success voters supported the end of

3677
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:13,620
marijuana permit prohibition by a 10

3678
02:34:10,829 --> 02:34:16,440
percentage point margin in 2012 and have

3679
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:19,230
continued to support it within the

3680
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:20,940
regulated marketplace 10 teens appear to

3681
02:34:19,229 --> 02:34:22,340
have been prevented from making illegal

3682
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:24,590
