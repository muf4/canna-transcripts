is expensive so do what you can i'm

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
getting enough support there's probably

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,439
somewhere else uh if you're not

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
supporting me and you are supporting

143
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,240
somebody that's fine that's what i'm

144
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,560
trying to say somebody else needs your

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
support that's cool um it goes on it

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,959

to follow my word hopefully step by step

157
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,038
word for word when i give instructions i

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
forget how much trust you put in me how

159
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,959
much faith you have in me i try to keep

160
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,959
that in mind but i try also not to let

161
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,319
it affect me i just try to deliver the

162
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,839
show i try not to let it get too

163
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,519
stressful and too heavy because it's

164
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,079
going to freak me out and mess it all up

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,159
so i'm glad that you are

166
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,159
noticing the the attention to detail and

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
i'm glad that you feel that you can just

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,439
trust me and follow along and that

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
things are going to go right just by

170
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,800
following my guidance i appreciate that

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,038
man thank you and i'm glad that i'm

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,639
making your garden better

173
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,800
excuse the throat clearing i did take

174
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
some fat fat dabs a moment ago this will

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
go away

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160
all right got to keep reading it says

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,120
uh where were we it says useful advice

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,280
then it says uh that being said i have a

179
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
different breeding question for you

180
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,559
we've been talking a lot about breeding

181
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,478
on the podcast lately i've really been

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
enjoying these breeding questions so

183
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,519
this one is a fun question for me it

184
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,599
goes on it says i've learned enough from

185
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,799
you to do my own breeding i've been

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
making my own seeds for years uh

187
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
i do appreciate that you feel like

188
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
you've learned enough from me about

189
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
breeding i hope you're reading some

190
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,719
other books read some mel frank some

191
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
greg green there are lots of other

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
breeding books a lot of other breeding

193
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,560
books that i would recommend you read

194
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,000
learn about mendel charts read

195
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
everything from gregor mendel learn

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
about alieal charts

197
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,598
learn all of that stuff then when it

198
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
actually comes time to breed forget you

199
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,959
learned all of that and do it all from

200
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,959
intuition but i think it's important to

201
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,719
learn all of that it goes on there's

202
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,318
more um

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
i have been breeding and making my own

204
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
seeds for years

205
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,399
i've been managed to do pheno hunting

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
testing and pollination which is hard

207
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,959
for me to actually express this question

208
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
i have okay i'm gonna do my best to

209
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,279
filter out your question

210
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,359
it says every time i've run across

211
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,758
i don't get a lot of seeds maybe a few

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,598
maybe 50 to 100 seeds

213
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
that's okay that's enough seeds to work

214
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,959
with to play with to learn a lot of

215
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,918
things about those plants and you just

216
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,000
need

217
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,359
possibly bigger plants and better timed

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,839
pollination which we can talk about

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,479
later if you want to it says you seem to

220
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,439
be a very smart businessman so i guess

221
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:45,360
my question is how would one go about

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,360
starting a seed company that is a very

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
deep and detailed question that i could

224
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
talk for days about so i will touch on

225
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
that and we'll try to get all of your

226
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,279
points here covered

227
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,280
one of the main questions he asks is how

228
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,679
do you keep genetics around i mean i

229
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,079
don't really care about plant counts but

230
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,478
i have to do phenohunts and make sure i

231
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,800
still have meds to get by

232
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,199
um yeah that's the hard part is being a

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
breeder making seeds and also having

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,360
enough non-seeded medicine to supply

235
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,120
yourself that's kind of

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,280
when i started transitioning from doing

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,079
seeds to not seeds that was something i

238
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,839
would struggle with

239
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,318
if you're not producing seeds on a

240
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,519
commercial level yet your small grow

241
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
space

242
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,318
if you make a little bit your doesn't

243
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,279
sound like you're getting a lot of seeds

244
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,680
now if we improve the size of the plants

245
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,240
the pollination times we can produce

246
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
many many more seeds in your grow space

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,038
whatever space you're using for your

248
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
personal production we can dedicate one

249
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
crop

250
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,919
per year in that space to make enough

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
seeds for a long time for you to work

252
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,599
with and play with maybe enough to send

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
out some testers to see if what you've

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
developed is

255
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,759
if it qualifies for the market so you

256
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
can make a lot of seeds i would i would

257
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,600
just dedicate one crop to seeds per year

258
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,120
if that's what you've got to do just go

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
in there and pollinate one time and then

260
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,519
clean it all up and then grow a bunch of

261
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,159
meds for the rest of the year hopefully

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,120
um then we got to teach you some tricks

263
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,879
to make the other crops fill in the gap

264
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
for that one crop that you took out for

265
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,080
that part of the year that's probably

266
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,639
another good thing to learn so we've

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
just got to pollinate one crop and then

268
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,480
recover for that one crop that you

269
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,759
didn't grow for your medicine this means

270
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
we got to increase production by

271
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,958
whatever that one crop is we got to

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,560
cover that by the next four or five

273
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,399
crops over the year

274
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,479
you understand what i'm saying

275
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,919
how do i have enough uh pollinate

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,278
pollinate plants and still have meds to

277
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,120
get by

278
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,559
it's all about finding more space you

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,799
said you don't care about plant counts

280
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,958
so more space more lights more plants

281
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,838
dude but try to keep the best you can

282
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,679
keep that pollen away from your

283
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,920
non-seeded stuff just learn how to have

284
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,399
veg and flower cycles off of each other

285
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,319
out of rhythm where you don't have plant

286
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
room a and flower while room b is in

287
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,839
flowers you could pollinate finish up

288
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
and then flower the other room right

289
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
away don't have them going in flower at

290
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,838
the same time and you won't pollinate

291
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
both rooms

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,480
i do apologize for all the throat

293
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,240
clearing in this episode it is quite

294
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
distracting but i'm gonna kind of a flow

295
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,839
so we're gonna keep going here

296
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,559
um one of the other questions how do you

297
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
keep genetics around i keep mother

298
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,399
plants just like a basic mother plant i

299
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,719
do have male and female plants i've got

300
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
the king solomon male plant i've got the

301
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,079
jack the ripper male plant that i keep

302
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,519
around big ups to sub cool shout out

303
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,039
missy buddy rest in peace big love but i

304
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
keep those plants just like a mother

305
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,838
plant they veg perpetually i keep them

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,159
in a large pot under

307
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,959
under a long light time cycle they stand

308
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,360
under a 19-5 cycle honestly i keep my

309
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,838
moms under 19-5

310
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
so they're on for 19 hours a day off for

311
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,000
five hours a day i keep them under uh

312
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,759
really powerful led lights right now

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,919
actually they're under canon leds big up

314
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,120
to uh black sail market check out black

315
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,360
sail market and i think you can use

316
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,278
coupon code rasta jeff might save you a

317
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
few bucks anyway i keep the mother

318
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,200
plants the father plants just in a

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
perpetual vegetative state and then when

320
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,879
i need them for breeding or whatever i'm

321
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,879
gonna do in the room i just cut a bunch

322
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,240
of clones and then veg those out and put

323
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,600
those in the room together and let them

324
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
have a party and that's how the breeding

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
happens

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
uh occasionally every

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,919
depending on the strain and the plant

328
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
and the vigor of the plant and how much

329
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,879
light that plant needs and how many

330
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
clones of that plant i take how

331
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,320
frequently sometimes i do what i call

332
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,119
re-momming a plant every three six nine

333
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,120
months like uh let's say strawberry

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
starburst let's talk about momming

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,679
strawberry starburst that plant grows

336
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
very fast very vigorous it's one of my

337
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,239
most productive plants it needs to be

338
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,879
remomed about every three to six months

339
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
which means the pot which is it which it

340
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,799
is in it becomes root bound if i put it

341
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
in a five or a seven i don't have room

342
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,399
for any bigger than a seven if i put it

343
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
in a five or a seven it will become root

344
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,240
bound in three to six months very

345
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,919
tightly root bound so it gets slow it

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,159
stops producing enough shoots it gets

347
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,078
kind of sad and shitty looking i've got

348
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,639
to cut a bunch of clones off of it

349
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,359
before it gets to that point ideally and

350
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,278
then uh either flower out that old one

351
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
outdoors or just toss that big one or

352
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,200
something and then use all those fresh

353
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,799
clones they will be part of them will be

354
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,440
a production run and then one of them

355
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,479
will be kept behind as the new mother

356
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,000
so that one gets remomed every probably

357
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
every four or five months honestly about

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,559
every four months let's talk about

359
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,479
remombing the mac the mac vegges quite

360
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,278
slowly she doesn't give me a lot of

361
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,440
clones uh so i veg that one in a smaller

362
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,679
pot and just let it veg for a really

363
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
long time i top it and then i take that

364
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,638
top and i make another plant out of it

365
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,320
and i let it grow right next to the

366
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
other one and then when i need clones i

367
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
actually cut clones off of both of those

368
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,239
so that i've got enough clones for my

369
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
project with the mac

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,919
because i need extra cuts because it

371
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
doesn't grow very well

372
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,519
but i use two plants as clone donors for

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,639
that because it doesn't give me a lot of

374
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,639
cuts i don't have to remom the mac every

375
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,919
every six months every eight months nine

376
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
months or something like that because

377
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,919
the roots don't go too crazy in that

378
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,679
plant it grows very slowly so i just

379
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,199
keep that one aside and let it keep

380
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,199
vegging all the others get up potted

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
that one doesn't get up potted i cut a

382
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,879
clone off of it grow it up cut a clone

383
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
off of that grow that one up so i've got

384
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,559
like three or four small mac plants that

385
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,399
are growing i can get clones off of all

386
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,000
of them when it's time to use them keep

387
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
one behind is the keeper plant i think

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
i've described keeping mother and father

389
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
plants properly

390
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
i think that is how i keep genetics

391
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,799
around

392
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
mother them father them

393
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,159
perpetually veg them and then when

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,040
they're getting too big cut clones off

395
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,639
them and start over a lot of times i try

396
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,559
to time it right to where i can go from

397
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,959
the three gallon to either the five or

398
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,399
the seven get clones off of it move that

399
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,719
into the flower room and then keep the

400
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,799
clones i just cut as my new mother so i

401
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
can keep it going forever so i'm vegging

402
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,039
using my mom plant as my new flowering

403
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,719
plant get a clone off of that kind of

404
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,559
keeps it going that way you'll learn a

405
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
rhythm of how to do that all right so

406
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,599
you said you don't really care about

407
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,839
plant count that is fun because the next

408
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
thing you said is phenohunts

409
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
if you're going to start a seed company

410
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
you're going to have to search out a lot

411
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
of things

412
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,159
um you've got breeding stuff right how

413
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,560
do you know it's any good you need to do

414
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,078
some feet need to do some pheno hunts

415
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,439
run a bunch of those seeds see what

416
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,599
you've got

417
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
pick one or two lines you said you've

418
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
read a few things pick one or two of

419
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,240
your favorites

420
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
run as many of them as you think you can

421
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
manage do them small they don't need to

422
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,000
be big pots put them in a one gallon pot

423
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
put them in a two gallon pot veg them

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,799
until they're just starting to show

425
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,879
their shape what they're going to be

426
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,319
shaped like then flower them out now you

427
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,240
know what you've got you can see if it's

428
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,440
crap or if it's amazing or if it's

429
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
somewhere in the middle you can see if

430
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
it's mutants if it's intersex

431
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
you know what you're working with now

432
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,319
now pick a bunch of those seeds out

433
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,958
package them up and send them out to

434
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
testers let them grow them do this do

435
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,439
the testers experience positive or

436
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,879
negative results with those seeds that's

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,199
how you're going to find out if you've

438
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,198
got good stuff so pheno hunting is going

439
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,879
to be a fun project especially when you

440
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,359
said you're not worried about plant

441
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,519
counts uh get good at identifying the

442
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,839
traits you're looking for get good at

443
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,919
identifying desirable traits what is the

444
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
product what does the market want

445
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,039
i don't follow trends like right now

446
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
everybody wants uh and no offense to the

447
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,240
market that's just not where i'm headed

448
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,600
people want uh cake and dessert flavored

449
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,360
stuff right now that seems to be the

450
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,680
trend i don't do that but what i do is i

451
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,919
watch and see like what are they after

452
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,559
is it but what if my stuff works they

453
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,278
want bud density they want flavor

454
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,799
what is working is it uh powdery mildew

455
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,480
resistant what are the things people are

456
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,559
after for their grow right now and then

457
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,240
i just make sure my stuff has those

458
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,319
traits and then if they like my flavors

459
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
and aromas that's what they're gonna buy

460
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,519
it for so i should get myself back on

461
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,278
track and jump back into the message

462
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,278
here it does say but king solomon for

463
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,198
example how do you keep that genetic

464
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,559
around for so long i think i talked a

465
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,879
little bit about that just keep it as a

466
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,399
mother plant grow it cut clones off of

467
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,000
it use the clones

468
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,159
put the big one in the room let him make

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,159
pollen then i've got clones kept behind

470
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,759
um it says i had a beautiful arise mail

471
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,519
that i just collected pollen from but

472
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
now he is gone

473
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
uh yeah you could have taken clothes

474
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,919
from him just like you do a female plant

475
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
and then uh you would have had him

476
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,399
around and then he could have done it

477
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,679
again and again and again

478
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,039
then it goes on to say i hope you can

479
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,958
kind of figure out what i'm asking

480
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,679
because i cannot figure out how to put

481
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,359
it into words thanks for any advice and

482
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,078
any response you may give and thank you

483
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,240
again for all the amazing content you

484
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,319
share with the world and of course happy

485
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,079
growing hey my friend adam thank you i

486
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
do have a few more notes to talk about

487
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,679
on this i just wanted to make sure to

488
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,919
cover the few questions that you did

489
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,599
specifically ask so

490
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,958
um you want to start a seed company we

491
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,159

around how to make a few more seeds uh

493
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,198

494
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,199
pheno hunting is going to be great get

495
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,958
testers out uh you still got to produce

496
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,359
your own medicine just maybe

497
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,758
use one room over there for meds and one

498
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,199
room over there for seeds and

499
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,360

cannabis industry the seed industry what

535
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,519

right so that's my main question all

544
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,440
right another note that i wrote down was

545
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,678
to not learn how to be a seed breeder

546
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
while you're starting a company learn

547
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,798
seed breeding learn the ins and outs of

548
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,120
seed breeding

549
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,440
learn the basics before you launch your

550
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,439
company if you put your brand and your

551
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,880
logo on some stuff and you send out some

552
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,279
stuff before you're ready and you

553
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
realize i don't know all the ins and

554
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,960
outs and i haven't thought this through

555
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,200
yet and you send out some problematic

556
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,279
seeds or your shipping isn't on time or

557
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
things go wrong and you start off wrong

558
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,519
you won't get far in this industry the

559
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,280
cannabis industry the seed breeding

560
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,440
industry the growers

561
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,960
the patients they're all on the internet

562
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
they all have a very tight-knit

563
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,000
community everybody knows everybody

564
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,919
every brand gets a very quick reputation

565
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,079
if you kind of suck at the beginning the

566
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,759
community is gonna say hey this new seed

567
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,119
company they failed at the very

568
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,400
beginning they didn't do me right they

569
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,959
didn't treat me right their product

570
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,798
wasn't good it didn't work for me you'll

571
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,798
never get very far after that because

572
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,359
word spreads like wildfire and this

573
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,279
industry we do take people's word for a

574
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,879
lot of what we're doing we use a lot of

575
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,879
recommendations and a lot of reviews

576
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,039
from the internet so that's going to

577
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
matter a lot so don't learn on your

578
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,720
customers get established learn what

579
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,160
you're doing then get a customer base

580
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,600
that's going to go a long way for you

581
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,919
because i see a lot of breeders on

582
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,079
social media doing it backwards they're

583
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
making seeds and trying to figure it out

584
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,000
and using their customers as their

585
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,880
tester base and as their uh their

586
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,798
education don't do that educate yourself

587
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
then sell seeds to your customers and

588
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,319
they'll be much more happy with you

589
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,519
you'll feel more pride and then they'll

590
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,519
you'll stick around and they'll come

591
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,480
back and buy more seeds i've got a lot

592
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:03,200
of stuff on my paper here um if you're

593
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,960
going to start a seed company oh

594
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
something that's going to say consumers

595
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,319
are very educated uh consumers are very

596
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,720
connected and they are not afraid to go

597
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,798
on the internet and either give you big

598
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,600
praise you can see like like you sent

599
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,200
here ross to jeff you did amazingly uh

600
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,119
there's also the opposite if you don't

601
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
do well you'll get the great thing about

602
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,158
the internet if you do a good job you'll

603
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
get one email if you do a bad job you'll

604
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,880
get about a hundred of them so if you

605
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,399
mess up

606
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,480
they're gonna they're you're gonna get

607
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,280
lit up really quickly and the consumers

608
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
are very very educated right now

609
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,240
they could listen to my show they could

610
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,759
listen to the dude gross show they could

611
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,159
listen to adam dunn they can listen to

612
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,000
tad hussy uh they can listen to danny

613
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,640
danko and mike they can listen to so

614
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
many shows out there to become very

615
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,759
educated consumers and then they all go

616
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,440
online they join my discord they join

617
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,759
everybody's discord every breeder out

618
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,919
there by now probably has a cool discord

619
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,000
and they all go get very very educated

620
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,520
they talk amongst each other we love

621
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,519
teaching each other we're all very

622
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,119
passionate so the consumers are very

623
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,200
educated right now and if you make some

624
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,719
mistakes they will see through it and

625
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
they'll call you out they'll point it

626
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,600

627
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,679
internet likes to say now so um yeah do

628
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,279
what you're gonna do but do it correctly

629
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
come correct is what i think they say

630
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,319
now because the consumers are very

631
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,279
educated

632
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,720
if you are going to start a seed company

633
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,200
from somebody who

634
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
has been in it for a while who is deep

635
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,120
in it now this is my life dude i i

636
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
there's no way out and that's cool i am

637
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,719
dedicated this is what i wanted i didn't

638
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,199
know this is what i was starting when i

639
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,200
started it but this is what i want

640
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,759
um there's no halfway in if you're

641
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
starting a seed company if you're all in

642
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,079
you're all in if you're not all in you

643
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,240
know it and don't even start if you've

644
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,399
got a backup plan if you say i'm going

645
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,279
to start this seed company but if it

646
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,798
fails you're already not in it you've

647
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,399
got to say i'm going to start this seed

648
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,158
company and then i'm going to do this

649
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,559
with the seed company and then in five

650
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,360
years i'll do this then in 10 years i'll

651
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,359
do this then we'll expand to this if

652
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,519
that's your thought process you've got a

653
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,839
chance of winning if you've got a backup

654
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,240
plan already if you've got an exit

655
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,199
strategy you are not meant to be in the

656
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,519
seed game this is a huge commitment this

657
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,400
is a huge lifestyle this isn't just a

658
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,038
business this isn't just um it's not

659
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,200
just work this is my lifestyle i have to

660
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,519
wake up and take care of plants before i

661
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
go to bed i am checking on plants i

662
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,519
spend the first part of my day answering

663
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,279
emails i know people are going no he

664
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,679

665
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,359
try i get a lot of emails there's social

666
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,960
media to be done there's merchandise to

667
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,038
be ordered there's packaging to be

668
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,319
ordered uh once the packaging gets here

669
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,079
you got to put the seeds in the

670
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,279
packaging you got to put the labels on

671
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,279
the packaging i do all of that stuff i

672
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,960
do get some help with some of the things

673
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,399
i like to do all the seed touching and

674
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
stuff myself

675
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,880
some of the other stuff i do let some

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
people help with but 99 of it is me

677
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
there's a web guy there's an accounting

678
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
team there's stuff oh then you got to go

679
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,599
talk to the lawyers you got to go talk

680
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,158
to the accountants you got to go do bank

681
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,079
stuff there's so much being involved so

682
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,559
if you want to do this

683
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,639
be all in it will be stressful in so

684
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,480
many ways but it's rewarding in so many

685
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,480
ways i wake up and i don't have to

686
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
answer to a boss the boss is myself and

687
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,319
the most i and i'm okay with that that's

688
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,159
what i want for my life there's nobody

689
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,678
bitching at me nobody telling me i'm

690
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
late nobody telling me that i suck that

691
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,159
i gotta work harder only me i'm the only

692
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
one that says that to me and that's okay

693
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
um

694
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,759
but it's it's a lifestyle it's a strain

695
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,879
on relationships because uh when you own

696
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,200
a business

697
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
it's hard to decide when to take a day

698
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
off you guys don't even want to know

699
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,678
what time it is right now when i'm

700
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,960
recording it's darkest [ __ ] out i'm the

701
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,559
only one up in the neighborhood

702
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,519
everybody can probably hear me talking

703
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,798
right now but that is entrepreneur life

704
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,038
if you're going to start a seed company

705
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,240
you become an entrepreneur you're you're

706
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,919
breeding you're taking care of the

707
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,359
garden you're taking care of the seeds

708
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
then you're marketing you're getting

709
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,959
merchandise you're meeting with people

710
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,278
you're worried about security you're

711
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
worried about financial things uh then

712
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,079
you're marketing again then there's

713
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
social media then you got to get up and

714
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,359
do it all again tomorrow when do you

715
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,720
take a break it's going to put a strain

716
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,079
on relationships it's going to put a

717
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,159
strain on a lot of things you have to

718
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,119
learn a lot of balance

719
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,520
but if you love it like i do uh it's

720
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,199
very very rewarding i think that the

721
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,359
interactions i've built with my audience

722
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,720
the irie army uh the grow from your

723
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:24,798
heart crew uh that is very rewarding

724
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,558
that refills all of the stress that this

725
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,319
company gives me it's not even that

726
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,038
stressful it's it's just it's it could

727
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,759
be so much more stressful but the

728
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,839
the things i have to handle the army the

729
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,759
crew replenish me i go hang out in the

730
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,079
chat i hang out on monday and you guys

731
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,919
uh give me praise and send me digital

732
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,678
fist bumps that stuff really does

733
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,679
recharge me of course the patreon and

734
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,519
the seed sales they do feel good as well

735
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,080
but all that stuff from the crowd the

736
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,440
army does recharge me so there is a lot

737
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,278
of work to be done it's going to put a

738
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
strain on your life your relationships

739
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,960
don't let it affect your health

740
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,038
learn some balance so if you've got an

741
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,079
exit strategy you're not in you've got

742
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,158
to be all in because uh this is an

743
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,639
all-in thing and it's getting

744
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,080
very competitive every year it gets more

745
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,520
competitive

746
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,079
speaking of every year i didn't think

747
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,440
about uh going to events once you've

748
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,278
started a seed brand where are you going

749
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,640
to sell your seeds

750
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,880
it's great to sell them on the internet

751
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,880
that feels really nice but the key is to

752
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
go to the places and meet the people and

753
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,720
shake their hands that's where you build

754
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,120
relationships that's where you build

755
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,960
long lasting clientele some of my

756
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,558
favorite people i meet at the events

757
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,319
they stand in front of my booth and wait

758
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,399
30 minutes to get in line to see me and

759
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,918
shake my hand but when they get there i

760
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
take my time with them i shake their

761
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,600
hand i look them in the eye and i'm like

762
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,600
bro i saw the pictures of the last girl

763
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,839
you did it looked amazing uh your new

764
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,519
baby is beautiful like conversations

765
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,158
like that you know who you are bro and

766
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,000
ma'am uh but uh yeah i like to meet the

767
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
people shake their hands give them hugs

768
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,400
high-five them take pictures with them

769
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,679
that's a huge huge part of being a seed

770
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,038
breeder you got to build a booth you

771
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,320
have to build a team that can work the

772
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,158
booth with you

773
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,240
then while you're at the booth at the

774
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,760
indo expo for the weekend who's taking

775
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,200
care of the garden at home who's taking

776
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,119
care of the seeds who's taking care of

777
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
the internet the website the orders

778
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,639
there are a lot of things to think about

779
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,080
logistics to deal with when it comes to

780
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,360
owning a legitimate seed company but if

781
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,720
you build a nice team and you got some

782
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,879
support it is very easy um the market is

783
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,880
getting more competitive the market is

784
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,000
getting much more competitive and more

785
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,960
fast pace all of the websites where i

786
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,278
vend if they had 10

787
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
breeders when i started now they've got

788
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,159
30. if they had 20 when i started now

789
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,399
they've got a hundred these websites are

790
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,559
building quickly of course i'm expanding

791
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,960
to more vendors i've got more outlets

792
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,720
but every website i go to they've got

793
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,640
more and more breeders which is more

794
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
competition which means that you've got

795
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,240
to do what i said earlier how do you

796
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,000
stand out how do you set apart what

797
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,319
makes you special why do i want to buy

798
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,798
your seeds why would i pick your brand

799
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,639
over the 700 other brands that are

800
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,158
available on the market right now so

801
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,520
you're gonna have to come up somehow

802
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,039
you're gonna have to stand out you're

803
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,879
gonna have to win some awards or put out

804
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,720
a strain that gets noticed

805
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,360
if you want longitudinally do something

806
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,600
real don't just use some shitty sales

807
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,759
tactics that a lot of other brands that

808
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,158
came and went tried to use

809
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,679
all right there's more there is more no

810
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,278
backup plan that's what i've got written

811
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,000
if you got a backup plan you're not in

812
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,119
it to win it uh one of the things i

813
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,398
struggled with and i keep kind of

814
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,038
mentioning this

815
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,439
letting others help with my company is

816
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,960
really hard for me i do have a web guy

817
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
because i have no idea what i'm doing

818
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,079
when it comes to building a website i

819
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,319
rely on him and trust him greatly i've

820
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,000
got a graphic design group i've got a

821
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,480

823
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,038

824
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559

827
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,519
design for blue raspberry truffle and

828
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,679
it's what i was thinking i didn't have

829
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,879
to send him my image or my idea he goes

830
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,399
i already know what you're going to do

831
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
bro here you go and he just sends it

832
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,278

833
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
shout out to kevin you know who you are

834
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,240
bro

835
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,839
he hooks me up with great art i do stuff

836
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,960
like that i let people help me out with

837
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,959
stuff like that but letting people uh

838
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,798
design some of the merch and do some of

839
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,038
that kind of stuff it took me a minute

840
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,679
to let go of some of that control i

841
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,879
still don't let anybody package seeds

842
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,480
every seed is packaged by hand by me

843
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,278
they come in a little round disc with a

844
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,679
little foam a protective insert all of

845
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,359
the seeds come out of a little uh it's a

846
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,399
ritual they get put into a little like a

847
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,839
just a cereal bowl a small cereal bowl

848
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,119
i roll them on the bottom of the bowl to

849
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,959
make sure they're nice and hard with

850
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,278
this finger and i make sure the seeds

851
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,558
nice and solid i set a few of them at

852
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,240
the edge of the bowl and then i try to

853
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,440
find 10 or 12 of them that look like

854
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,079
they would be friends to go in a

855
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,640
container together maybe that's crazy

856
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,278
but i package every seed by myself

857
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,038
they're irie genetics hand selected

858
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,038
premium seeds and i think that doing

859
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,038
that it says it on the package that's

860
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,480
what i talk about i need to follow that

861
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,158
and that's why i stand out because i

862
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,000
touched those seats and i made sure that

863
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,520
they're quality i don't trust anybody

864
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
else to do that

865
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,200

life easier it was hard hard hard hard

904
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
to let people have a little bit of

905
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,679
control in this company because it was

906
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,678
my vision it's my baby so learn how to

907
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,440
delegate learn what you're comfortable

908
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,960
letting other people do so once the

909
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,278
seeds go into the container and that

910
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,200
part is sealed up sometimes i do let

911
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,960
other people fold the card and put a

912
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,880
sticker on it and put that into a baggie

913
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,960
and heat seal it but that's like the

914
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,720
only part i really let other people do

915
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,880
for me because that's kind of i can

916
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,600
watch them do it and i give them 100

917
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
packs 100 bubbles with 100 cards and 100

918
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,879
stickers and they kind of can't screw it

919
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,519
up they kind of have to try to [ __ ] that

920
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,480
up so i do let other people do that part

921
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,558
sometimes but most of the time it's just

922
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
me doing the seed packaging

923
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,000
so learning to let other people help is

924
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,759
a challenge know when to ask for help um

925
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,919
so then you've got to

926
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,798
just do it man just do it and then learn

927
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,080
how to adjust and adapt to the market

928
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,679
things are going to happen things are

929
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,119
going to go wrong things won't go as

930
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,120
expected

931
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,798
i've been booked for events and had the

932
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,558
car loaded up and was about to get in

933
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,398
the car and then got an email or a text

934
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:17,839
message saying hey they just came and

935
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,918
said you can't sell seeds here and i'm

936
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,759
like well i paid you a lot of money for

937
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,880
that booth and i'd like to go sell seeds

938
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,480
there and they're like no you can't even

939
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
sell seeds i wouldn't even show up if i

940
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,640
were you i'll give you back your money

941
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,798
or or you might not even get your money

942
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,399
back those are often options at events

943
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:36,720
um so learn to adjust and adapt recently

944
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,319
uh my instagram page got [ __ ] taken

945
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,399
uh luckily i've got a good team we got

946
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,158
that back quite quickly but that's a

947
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,719
great marketing tool and without that i

948
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,519
was not reaching over 30 000 people when

949
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
i post uh over 500 people would see my

950
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,278
stories every time i post them that was

951
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,759
500 people that were not seeing my

952
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,519
content potential uh those are we call

953
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,960
those leads in the business industry so

954
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,200
it took a minute to get the instagram

955
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,798
back there's always going to be stepping

956
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,120
stones and stuff like that learn to

957
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,359
adjust and adapt shit's not going to go

958
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,959
smoothly for the first two years and

959
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,158
then you're going to get busy and it's

960
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,679
going to feel like you're never going to

961
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
catch up which is a good thing if you

962
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,080
feel like you're catching up in a

963
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,760
business that means you don't have

964
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,319
enough to do it means you're failing you

965
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,480
got to find more [ __ ] to do um so i'm

966
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,839
rambling on that let's see then there's

967
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,679
marketing networking and being involved

968
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,599

969
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,440
are people going to know that you exist

970
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,599
social media will get you so far but

971
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,000

994
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,158
at your level and split the booth with

995
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,399
them or maybe two or three other

996
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,720
breeders and get like four or five other

997

998
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,480
the game all of you can go and network

999
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
together you can all use your social

1000
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
media powers together power in numbers

1001
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
more people will come to the booth then

1002
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,919
when somebody comes to the booth to buy

1003
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,918
your friends seeds they'll say oh you

1004
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,679
made a cross of that and that i want

1005
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,159
those seeds also and now you've made a

1006
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,159
new client a new customer a new lead and

1007
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,240
then you cross advertise with each other

1008
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,760
like that i don't feel competition in

1009
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,278
the breeding game so i'm all about

1010
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,679
teaching my friends how to get into this

1011
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,558
and helping you do it just know uh it's

1012
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,559
over saturated and a lot of us are uh

1013
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,558
it's already taken up dude the pie is

1014
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,000
already getting eaten up but i'm not

1015
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,519
afraid to teach you guys how to get into

1016
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,640
it because i feel it's like

1017
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,880
um

1018
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,640
it's like food and music i make a

1019
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,240
certain kind of thing and you might not

1020
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,000
be into my certain kind of thing and

1021
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,239
that is okay with me because there are

1022
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,358
plenty of people that are into it

1023
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,519
i'm into

1024
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,759
fish the banned fish and i'm into the

1025
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,480
grateful dead and i love reggae music

1026
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,639
that's my little box my genre of stuff i

1027
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,039
really really enjoy so let's just

1028
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,119
hypothetically say that my seeds are

1029
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,960
that kind of music well say i put out

1030
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,559
fish and reiki and grateful dead vibes

1031
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,800
with my seeds

1032
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,119
if you've got norwegian death metal

1033
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,039
seeds that's not gonna be my favorite

1034
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,358
i'm not against it i got no problem with

1035
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,800
it that's just not my favorite but

1036
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,440
there's gonna be somebody at the

1037
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,000
convention that is looking and has been

1038
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,599
looking their whole life for norwegian

1039
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,039
death metal seeds maybe you're into

1040
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,639
country music there's a breeder that

1041
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,279
breeds seeds that are aimed toward the

1042
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,878
country music vibe i'm just being i'm

1043
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
just giving you analogies here trying to

1044
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,838
compare some [ __ ] but i don't feel any

1045
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,519
competition because i make a certain

1046
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,679
type of product and other breeders out

1047
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,519
there make a certain type of product and

1048
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,279
a lot of the times uh people in the

1049
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,440
community have already decided what

1050
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,040
they're into if you're into a certain

1051
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,320
thing like if a lot of people have

1052
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,320
already decided when they go to the

1053
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,640
event i want to go find mr soul or i

1054
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,400
want to go find ire genetics or i want

1055
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,400
to go find capulator everybody goes and

1056
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
gets in caps line so we already know

1057
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,880
we've already kind of found the band

1058
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,560
that we're looking for it's like when

1059
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,559
you go to the festival can't wait for

1060
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,639
six o'clock i gotta go see fish at the

1061
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,078
main stage or whatever band you're into

1062
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,559
you already know it the industry gets

1063
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
like that i feel no competition no uh no

1064
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,639
weird vibes or anything like that toward

1065
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,479
any of the industry so i think i covered

1066
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,838
most of my notes i did write a lot of

1067
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,760
stuff down that was a really good

1068
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,440
