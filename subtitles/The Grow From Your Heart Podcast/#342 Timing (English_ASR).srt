is a beautiful day it's been a beautiful

35
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,978
day the past few days have not been as

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,469
beautiful all of the outdoor growers are

37
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,750
working for their money this season if

38
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,819
you've got outdoor plants in southern

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,319
Colorado you were working your ass off

40
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,328
the past couple of days because it has

41
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,269
been raining it has been hailing like

42
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,339
crazy golf ball-sized tail was not an

43
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,798
issue it was the grapefruit sized hail

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,420
it was damaging things there's a zoo in

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
Colorado Springs they got the [ __ ] beat

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,710
out of that zoo animals died people were

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,780
taken to the hospital it has been crazy

48
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,158
weather-wise here in Colorado so if

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,079
you're growing outdoors this year much

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,270
respect you were working your ass off I

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,699
hope it goes well for you also if you're

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,798
facing a wildfire and your cannabis grow

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,450
good luck with that that's got to be

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,520
some scary [ __ ] I hope it all goes well

55
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,140

56
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,149
don't have a cannabis grow I hope things

57
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,239

August 30

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,848
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself

63
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,650
I've got a little vacation coming up I'm

64
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:22,409
trying to get prepared so I don't miss

65
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,939
an episode let's get this show on track

66
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,650
you know I like to start the podcast off

67
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,840
by letting you know what I am smoking on

68
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,539
today and this evening I've been taking

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,209
dad's of fatso nectar from Green Dot

70
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:36,389
labs this is a combination of GMO and

71
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,780
legend OG the flavour is described as

72
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,639
dark roast coffee garlic and fuel I

73
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,219
absolutely got all three of those

74
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,289
flavors in there on the inhale you get

75
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,060
the dark roast coffee maybe a little

76
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,068
here by mate' flavor a little bit of

77
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,019
sweetness on the inhale then as you

78
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,849
exhale it that's where the fuel came in

79
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,950
for me as the smoke went across my

80
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,689
tongue across my lips on the exhale

81
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,030
that's where I picked up that fuel

82
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,039
flavor I've been is it sat there for a

83
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,360
moment I exhaled I closed my mouth I

84
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,098
licked my lips I took a breath and

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,830
that's when the garlic flavor kicked in

86
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,259
I had garlic breath from this dab it's

87
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,540
enjoyable I really like it it's warm

88
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,419
it's savory and the high from it is just

89
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,979
right it's settled in it's like comfort

90
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,569
high it's like comfort food and a

91
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,238
comfort high it's got that garlicky

92
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,799
comfort food flavor it's savory and real

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,450
nice and it tastes like it would be warm

94
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,609
if this was food it would be like warm

95
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,768
garlic mashed potatoes and then it

96
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,150
settles in with this a nice body warming

97
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,760
high it's like wearing a sweater

98
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,250
it's nice and chilling on my head it's

99
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,899
got me nice and mellowed out it's really

100
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,159
nice and it's honestly way different

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,840
than what I normally would purchase

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,030
usually I want something that's gonna

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,769
make my brain skyrocket spin around and

104
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,180
make me forget where I put my keys and

105
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,189
lose my sunglasses while they're on my

106
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,709
head but this fatso nectar has just got

107
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,329
me chilling and I really enjoy it so I'm

108
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,189
smoking on the fatso nectar from Green

109
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,319
Dot labs they do not pay me you guys I

110
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,759
pay for this stuff I just like to share

111
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,259
what I'm smoking with the audience so

112
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,879
you guys know why I sound like I'm only

113
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,388
at half-speed for the first 10 minutes

114
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,299
of the show a couple of episodes ago I

115
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,060
spoke for far too long about insert dabs

116
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm gonna take a little less time than I

117
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,900
spent on insert dabs to talk about

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,909
something else I was sent my friends at

119
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,280
happy daddy sent me a very nice care

120
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,769
package they sent me a banger they sent

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,658
me a insert they sent me a carb cap

122
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,418
they sent me a couple of great dabbers

123
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:26,319
they also sent me some turps spinners

124
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,668
also known as pearl

125
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,439
I've seen them labeled as different

126
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:31,779
things in different markets they're all

127
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,060
the same thing they are tiny glass balls

128
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,649
it's like the size of a pea it's the

129
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,689
perfect size of a pea I think this is

130
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,489
somewhere between seven and nine

131
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,949
millimeters is the size of this little

132
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,538
ball here so the idea is you put one or

133
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,520
two or you could put more if you want I

134
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:47,889
put two inside the Banger I've got a

135
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,658
banger it is fairly deep if you don't

136
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,370
know what a banger is I'm I won't go too

137
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:54,759
far into that it is it looks like a

138
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,740
glass thimble that attaches to your rig

139
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,419
which is a small bong don't use a big

140
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,310
rig use a small rig you guys there's so

141
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:01,778
many reasons why a small rig is better

142
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,218
than a big rig you don't want to smoke a

143
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:04,598
gallon of oxygen you don't need a liter

144
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,939
of air in your lungs you want to get a

145
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:08,348
[ __ ] dab to your face okay on a bong

146
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,580
you fill it up with all that smoke right

147
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:10,930
you smoke and smoke and smoke and then

148
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,098
once that chambers fill do you pull it

149
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,810
and then you get all that smoke boom

150
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,579
there's no need to do that with a rig

151
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,839
you want to press that dab against a

152
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,938
nail and you want that smoke to go to

153
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,978
your brain and since I'm ranting since

154
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,449
I'm going off on a side right here when

155
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:23,800
you're putting the carb cap on quit

156
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,629
taking it off like I get it you gonna

157
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,949
lift it off for a second to carb the dad

158
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,270
so that you can get all that smoke out

159
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:30,009
of the rig and you can take a fresh pull

160
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,389
when you go back in but leave the carb

161
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,500
cap on there when you're dabbing because

162
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,088
every time you take it off you're

163
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,740
letting heat out and it's changing the

164
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:37,028
temperature of that oil that's in there

165
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,168
and things just leave it on there it'll

166
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:40,060
work better for you it's so frustrating

167
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,588
to see everyone on Instagram they put

168
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,180
the carb cap on they give it a swirl and

169
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,949
they take the carb cap off and exhale

170
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,329
their dab they get their brain together

171
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,770
then they put the cap on and go back for

172
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,359
another pool if you want to left that

173
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,338
cap on there it would have been more

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,259
beneficial for you in my opinion and in

175
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:56,199
my experience so let me get back on

176
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:58,718
track this uh banger it's called the

177
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,150
banger it's the dab nail it attaches to

178
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:03,848
my rig it's got a thimble like piece of

179
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:05,620
glass on it so I heat that thimble like

180
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:07,870
piece of glass first I drop my glass

181
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,370
ball in there I don't know if you heard

182
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,468
that on the mic or not just put a little

183
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,709
couple glass balls inside of the banger

184
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:16,930
then I heat the banger where the wall

185
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,459
and the floor meet I heat at an angle

186
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,408
right at that corner I try to heat that

187
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,908
corner up right there I move around the

188
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:23,500
base of the rig I want most of my heat

189
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:26,110
down there on the bottom that's where my

190
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,028
dad is going to go the base of my new

191
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,889
banger from happy daddy and black market

192
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:31,180
glass the base is fairly thick so I got

193
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,829
to heat it for kind of a little bit and

194
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,870
then let it cool just to the right

195
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,939
temperature those balls that I've got in

196
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,800
there are also heated they're going to

197
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,848
help maintain temperature now I can

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
scoop up a

199
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:44,079
anok dad and I can drop that dab in

200
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,598
there now as soon as the oil hits the

201
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,609
nail science says that it starts cooling

202
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,228
bad combination it starts getting cooler

203
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,699
right so if you put a real big dab in

204
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,199
there you got to start smoking it

205
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,639
quickly because you're losing all of

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,069
your temperature so you throw a carb cap

207
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,278
on there that helps you stoke that heat

208
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,289
and there helps you vaporize your dab at

209
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:04,598
a lower temperature because it creates a

210
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:06,068
vacuum the let there's less air pressure

211
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,978
coming in there's heat in there it takes

212
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,749
less heat to cook your dab now I got

213
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,668
this glass ball in there it was in there

214
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,769
when I heated the nail so that's also

215
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:17,618
got heat in it when I put the carb cap

216
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:20,019
on there I takes a specific carb cap a

217
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:21,729
non-directional carb cap is better you

218
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:25,119
need a carb cap that points straight

219
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:26,438
down and has semi-decent airflow so you

220
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,629
put the carb cap on there and when you

221
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,610
start smoking these Terp spinners they

222
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,860
start doing a little dance inside the

223
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,360
nail and if you suck just right and I'm

224
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,759
not gonna edit that out I probably

225
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,740
should if you inhale just right if you

226
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,360
pull it just the right speed you'll get

227
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,610
those little beads in there to spin

228
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,990
around inside your nail they'll lift up

229
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,278
and start spinning inside they're like

230
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,430
they're little kids on the Gravitron

231
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:50,259
it's pretty neat to watch it's cool then

232
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,360
when you're dab is done you grab a q-tip

233
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,649
and you clean out the banger and then

234
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,479
you've got to get those little balls out

235
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:57,278
there and kind of clean them off too I

236
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,740
get just a paper towel and some

237
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:01,028
isopropyl alcohol I get the q-tip and

238
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,439
clean it out the best I can and then

239
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:03,848
once it cools I just take the banger

240
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,699
right off the rig dump the little balls

241
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:08,378
into the ISO soaked paper towel and just

242
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,088
rub them down rub your balls down and

243
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,379
get a nice and clean and then just drop

244
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:15,309
them right back into the Banger and

245
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,408
they're cool I liked the way it helps

246
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,389
spin my dad around when you put the dab

247
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:21,129
directly onto the hot glass it likes to

248
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,740
singe if you have it too hot it'll just

249
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,999
scorch it right up that's what a liquid

250
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,528
is gonna do when it hits glass it's

251
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:29,289
gonna paper eyes it's gonna boil

252
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:30,639
basically so when you put the Terp

253
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:32,500
spinners in there and it's moving the

254
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,459
oil around you can let it go a little

255
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,958
cooler on the temperature and then

256
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,938
because you don't have to go in let's

257
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,218
see how I can say this since it's going

258
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:44,588
to retain heat longer I can let it cool

259
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,028
a little bit more so I can go in a

260
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,500
little cooler and I know that those

261
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,509
little hot balls and they're gonna spin

262
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,828
around they're gonna keep my dad cooking

263
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,299
because they've retained heat but

264
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,099
they're also gonna splash that oil

265
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,049
around on the

266
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,850
nail tore it doesn't sit in a hot spot

267
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,799
and scorch it's moving so it's got

268
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,490
that's like flipping the veggies in the

269
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,189
frying pan

270
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,350
so it's cooking my oil slowly and I'm

271
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,699
getting a more of a vaporize to instead

272
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,550
of a burnt hit and I'm getting a lot

273
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:10,828
more Terps out of it so now I'm gonna

274
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,240
compare the I said that wasn't gonna be

275
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:13,588
as long as the insert dab talked but I

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,480
probably [ __ ] that up already I'm

277
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,850
gonna kind of compare the insert dab to

278
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,769
The Spinners the spinners are fun the

279
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,870
spinners are cool they're really novel

280
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,250
it's fun to watch it's fun for your

281
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,250
friends to go huh that's cool I see it's

282
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,169
been in there really didn't do too much

283
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,458
improvement on my dad I know I just said

284
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:32,519
that I was able to cook it at a lower

285
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,739
temperature yeah that's cool I could

286
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,799
really do that way better with the

287
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,690
insert tab the insert dad crushes it if

288
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,370
I'm in the mood for a giant dad and I

289
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,079
really want to take a chunky dab the

290
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,940
insert tab is the way to do it I get the

291
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,250
little the smaller thimble and I load

292
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,079
that sucker up and then I feel like I

293
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,690
can heat the [ __ ] out of that nail and I

294
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,219
haven't really overheated to do an

295
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,930
insert tab yet I haven't gotten that

296
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,699
squirts flavor I haven't really fried my

297
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,919
lungs yet it feels like the insert dab

298
00:09:56,698 --> 00:10:00,719
is the way to go and the Terps and the

299
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,969
high are tremendous from the insert tab

300
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,339
so the turb spinners are cool they're

301
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,170
fun they're very novel you need the

302
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,339
appropriate carb cap to make it work if

303
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,169
you don't have the right carb cap you're

304
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,389
gonna just suck so hard and you're like

305
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,469
they don't move at all and the the

306
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,938
little balls are just gonna sit there

307
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,100
but if you've got the appropriate carb

308
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:18,480
cap in the appropriate nail and you can

309
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,000
get the pressure right they will spin

310
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
around in there it's fun it's novel it's

311
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,039
cool a couple of times I got burned out

312
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,638
on it and I hit the insert more honestly

313
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,129
you guys

314
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,769
I find myself hitting my basic thermal

315
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,629
banger more than anything I've got it

316
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,129
timed out to where I know exactly how

317
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:37,799
long to heat it how long to let it cool

318
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,389
I know just how big of a dab that amount

319
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,068
of heat can take I know when to throw

320
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,600
that dab in there I know and get the

321
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,519
carb cap on there I know how hard I can

322
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,259
pull to get the air through the carb cap

323
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,519
and still not get water into my mouth if

324
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,980
I suck on that rig too hard

325
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,578
I find myself hitting the thermal banger

326
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,159
more than anything the Terp spinners

327
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,169
they're cool they're novel it didn't

328
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,850
make a whole lot of difference the

329
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:01,919
insert is cool but you got to let it

330
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,808
cool after you hit it and then you got

331
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,009
to pull that insert out and then you got

332
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:06,189
to clean that and then you got to load

333
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,840
up another dad

334
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,370
it's fun and it's a cool process if

335
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,600
you're dabbing by yourself and you don't

336
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,850
have a buddy sitting across the table

337
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,110
going so can I get a dab also bro cause

338
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,670
I just watched you take one you've been

339
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,730
clean and [ __ ] for the next four minutes

340
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,019
so insert dabs are cool for like if

341
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,550
there's one or two of you hanging out

342
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,319
and Mike's patient and not in a hurry

343
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,519
for a DAB but if you're dabbing with

344
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,629
like three or four people and you got to

345
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,340
get the rig around the room and

346
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,889
everybody wants to get stoned a normal

347
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,899
Bangor style nail is probably the better

348
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,370
way to go for you've got a lot of people

349
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,049
you might want to bust out a couple of

350
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,269
rigs you might want to get an email set

351
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:39,759
up but if we're gonna compare the Terp

352
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,539
spinners to the insert I would prefer

353
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:46,149
the insert all day but for me the insert

354
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:48,309
is too much maintenance for a group or

355
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:50,110
on the go all right I tried to keep that

356
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:51,399
short I hope that was short enough for

357
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,840
you once again a big shot it's my

358
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,559
friends at happy daddy for the wonderful

359
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,690
care package I do appreciate that now

360
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,819
let's move this podcast forward I'm

361
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,970
going to read a comment that I got from

362
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,920
a grower friend and it goes like this

363
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,620
you have the most entertaining cannabis

364
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,719
podcast by far I've got a question for

365
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,919
you hey first off thanks for enjoying my

366
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,509
podcast and thanks for the great

367
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,610
compliment and thanks for this message

368
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:17,799
then the question says it's my first

369
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,690
time making seeds and my plants are on

370
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,179
the same flowering period they are

371
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,460
outdoors will this be an issue that the

372
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,379
females are getting pollen later in the

373
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,629
flowering period I know this is how

374
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:32,289
nature intended it but I've read they

375
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:34,509
need pollen earlier than that so this

376
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:36,699
guy's got an outdoor crop that he

377
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,379
intends on making seeds he's got a male

378
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,660
out there and probably multiple females

379
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,789
he's gonna flower them out using the

380
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,469
natural cycle of the Sun then that male

381
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,360
is going to dump pollen on his girls and

382
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,570
he's gonna have seeds his concern is

383
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,009
that the male and female aren't going to

384
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,740
time up because when a lot of breeders

385
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,870
talk about timing and pollination in an

386
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,029
indoor environment we'd like to get the

387
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,500
male a little bit ahead of the girls we

388
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,299
like to put him in the room and get his

389
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,830
pollen started and then we keep him

390
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:05,229
separate and then we get the girls in

391
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,570
the room and each girl each female plant

392
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,700
likes to be pollinated at a different

393
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,500
time my lemon skunk plant you've got to

394
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,540
wait a little later in the flowering

395
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,970
phase to pollinate her in the Platinum

396
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,449
tangi platinum tangi wants pollen really

397
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,879
early

398
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,140
lemon skunk wants pollen really late so

399
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,600
I would put the

400
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,159
and skunk in the room seven to ten days

401
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,960
before the Platinum tangi throw that

402
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,309
platinum tangi in there get them both

403
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,500
caught up to where they're both at their

404
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,729
prime time for pollination then I've

405
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,289
already got that boy in there

406
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,029
he's been dumping pollen for a little

407
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:35,559
while he's in this peak pollination time

408
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,879
now he's got a lot of pollen just

409
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,709
falling off of him that's when I would

410
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,659
go drag him across the room and shake

411
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,700
the [ __ ] out of him and all his pollen

412
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:45,819
would go over those girls which are both

413
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,009
at their peak ovulation time indoors

414
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,870
it's a little more critical I think

415
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,240
you've got the right idea when you said

416
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,830
I know this is how nature intended it

417
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,590
but I've read that they need pollen

418
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,810
earlier than that no your boy plant is

419
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,090
going to be dumping pollen outside and

420
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:04,359
plenty of time for your girls to receive

421
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,610
pollen if anything that boy is gonna

422
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,200
start dumping pollen a little bit too

423
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,029
early and you're not gonna want to get

424
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,390
the pollen on those girls like I said

425
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,980
until that peak ovulation time your male

426
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:17,169
plant is going to start putting out

427
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,690
pollen early in the flowering cycle

428
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,219
indoors it would be around day 14

429
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,040
outdoors it's hard to predict because I

430
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,629
don't know what strain you're growing I

431
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,679
don't know where it came from I don't

432
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,120
know if it was indoors and brought

433
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,959
outdoors I don't know if it's in a pot

434
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,909
and it's rootbound

435
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,590
I don't know it's conditions but that

436
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:36,969
plants going to start dropping pollen

437
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:39,129
around maybe twelve days 14 days 17 days

438
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,920
into flower those girls aren't going to

439
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:45,279
be ready for pollen until about day 23

440
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,319
25 maybe 27 for some of those plants

441
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,629
lemon skunk doesn't want pollen until

442
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,090
closer to day 32 the lemon skunk that

443
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,309
I've got I have no idea what girls or

444
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,530
males you have got in there or out there

445
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,269
this is an outdoor I don't have any idea

446
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,009
what genetics you're working with and I

447
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,809
don't know their condition when you put

448
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,059
them out so I don't know how soon your

449
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,799
boy is going to start dropping pollen

450
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,009
honestly it'll be somewhere around

451
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,839
between day 12 and 14 or 17 the pollen

452
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,600
will start coming out like I said those

453
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,250
girls aren't ready by then so the trick

454
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,769
would be keeping the pollen off of those

455
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,419
girls until they're nice and fluffy when

456
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,949
they start looking like dandelions when

457
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,449
they're coated and you guys call them

458
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,250
the white hairs those hairs are what

459
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,170
received the pollen those hairs are

460
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,639
pistils those pistols catch the pollen

461
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:29,439
and the pollen lands on there and it

462
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,269
slides down that pistol and it goes into

463
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,980
the ovule that ovule starts producing a

464
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,559
seed and fills that calyx pot up with

465
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,080
the sea

466
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,329
so my point is the more of those fluffy

467
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,639
hairs those pistols you have available

468
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,700
the more seed production you can get off

469
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,350
of your plant so in a perfect world we

470
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,580
would time up our plants who keep the

471
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,899
mail way over there we would keep the

472
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,070
girl way over there we would keep the

473
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,149
other girl way over there and when it

474
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,920
was time we would bring them all into

475
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,590
the same room we'd match them all up and

476
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,289
we would do the deed but we can't do

477
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,910
that outdoors so you're right nature is

478
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,409
going to make it happen just like it

479
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,689
should these plants have been surviving

480
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:04,579
and reproducing on their own for a long

481
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,800
time but the trick there is that those

482
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,050
were probably land races so it was the

483
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,699
same strand was the same cross it was

484
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,349
the same mail and same girl and they

485
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,759
were pollinating each other and dropping

486
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,029
seeds and it was just different F

487
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,919
generations every year no your plants

488
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,389
are not in the perfect world you're not

489
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,549
in an indoor environment where you can

490
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:25,699
time everything you were going to make

491
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:28,059
plenty of seeds trust me it doesn't take

492
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,660
much pollen to make a lot of seed

493
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:32,659
especially in an outdoor environment

494
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:34,039
this is what the plants want to do if

495
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,929
you're just trying to make seeds for

496
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,279
yourself you're going to be overwhelmed

497
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,769
you're going to be amazed with how many

498
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,740
seeds you produce and one small seed run

499
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:44,689
from some outdoor plants so the short

500
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,490
version of my answer is just let it

501
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,470
happen naturally and everything will be

502
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,240
fine if you can keep that pollen if you

503
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,550
can keep that male plant from being

504
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,149
disturbed too much try that but it's

505
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:58,159
outdoors wind animals bugs all kinds of

506
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,259
shit's gonna disrupt your goal so let it

507
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,449
happen naturally and everything should

508
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,039
be just fine one thing I will recommend

509
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,309
when I am making seeds when I am

510
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,318
purposely seating a crop I increase the

511
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,869
amount of amino acids I feed my plants

512
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,759
they want more aminos so if you're not

513
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,500
already adding an amino product you may

514
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,349
want to consider adding something with

515
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,390
amino acids to your lineup right at the

516
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,909
beginning of flowering and through the

517
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,819
seed production phase of your breeding

518
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,459
program now you said this is your first

519
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:32,149
attempt at breeding I am going to give

520
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,009
some breeding advice and guidance when

521
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,420
those seeds are done keep them all

522
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,859
separated so that you know what you've

523
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,029
got right obviously hopefully you're

524
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:40,189
that far ahead of the game you know to

525
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:42,410
keep plant a with seed a and plant B

526
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,420
with seeds B and you got a plant labeled

527
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,070
or a jar labeled seeds from plant a and

528
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,060
a jar labeled and you've got the cross

529
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,658
written down and you know what you've

530
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,690
got

531
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:52,460
now it is your job to grow those seeds

532
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,269
out yourself before they go anywhere

533
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,630
either you or somebody that you know and

534
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:01,308
trust and they have been told these are

535
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,440
test beans I don't know what they're

536
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:05,509
gonna do you're putting something in

537
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,330
somebody's hand that is going to cost

538
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,548
them money they have to pay first off

539
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:12,528
for dirt the seeds have to go into some

540
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,298
dirt they have to pay for pots to put

541
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:16,970
the dirt in then they've got to pay for

542
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:18,288
lights to run the plants under then

543
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,380
they've got to pay for nutrients to feed

544
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:24,589
these plants don't give these seeds to

545
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,510
somebody who really needs a crop of

546
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:28,189
medicine to survive that doesn't

547
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:30,200
understand they've got a test crop

548
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,460
you've got to say these could all be

549
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,950
mutants these could all be

550
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,069
hermaphrodites this could all be [ __ ]

551
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,710
sometimes when you breed it doesn't work

552
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:42,230
out there are ugly people there are ugly

553
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,329
dogs they're ugly animals sometimes any

554
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,990
breed you make some ugly [ __ ] it's just

555
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:50,569
how things go as a breeder it is your

556
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:53,538
responsibility to make sure you were

557
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:55,849
improving cannabis and not [ __ ] it up

558
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:58,129
by putting out a bunch of seeds that are

559
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:01,099
going to take us backwards in the

560
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:04,159
evolution of cannabis we want to improve

561
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:06,109
if your offspring is not better than the

562
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,750
plant you started with you were not

563
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:10,788
doing any justice unless you have

564
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,980
isolated a specific trait you were

565
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,589
looking for and you wrote down in the

566
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,940
beginning and predicted it not just said

567
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,819
hey that happened that's something I was

568
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,740
looking for so it is your responsibility

569
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:23,240
to let the grower know what you're

570
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,220
giving them it is also your

571
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,740
responsibility to grow those seeds out

572
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,500
before you market them and make sure you

573
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,940
have got a quality product don't put

574
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,829
some hermaphrodites out for the world

575
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,019
don't put some [ __ ] out for the

576
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:38,058
world test it yourself like I said if

577
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,548
it's not better than the parent it's not

578
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:42,319
worth putting out unless you have

579
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:44,509
isolated a trait and improved on that

580
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,879
trait or stabilize something or

581
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:48,500
corrected a problem within that plant

582
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,350
but if you had a problematic plant why

583
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,079
were you breeding it anyway unless you

584
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:55,278
knew that you wanted to fix it so now

585
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,960
you've got a bunch of brand new seeds

586
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,159
now you've got to grow them out yourself

587
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,079
you've got to pay attention to him

588
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,720
you've got to take notes you've got to

589
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,639
take pick

590
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,350
you've got to keep a journal you've got

591
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
to see if what you have produced is

592
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:08,158
worth a [ __ ]

593
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,720
once you've ran plenty of these seeds to

594
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,610
make sure you've got something that

595
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,500
doesn't hermaphrodite on you and that

596
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,928
isn't just [ __ ] [ __ ] altogether

597
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,130
then you've got a stress test it you got

598
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,288
to beat the [ __ ] out of the plants

599
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,299
you've got to take a few and put them in

600
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:23,369
a room and mess up the light cycle and

601
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,869
see if they flip out on you take a few

602
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,569
other plants and put them in a room and

603
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:29,489
feed them way too hard see what they do

604
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:31,019
take a few more plants put them in

605
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,150
another room and mess with the humidity

606
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,788
real bad or make it too cold just piss

607
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,470
the plants off see how they react take

608
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:39,808
some air plants and put them in a room

609
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,429
we all know this one guy that grows he

610
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:42,750
gets powdery mildew every time he grows

611
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,880
he's always complaining about it always

612
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,558
happens around the end of August because

613
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,460
it start getting real moist here it

614
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,259
starts getting cold

615
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,610
things just going we know every year

616
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,319
we've all got friends that complain

617
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:54,089
about powdery mildew give a clone to

618
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,129
that guy see if he gets a powdery mildew

619
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,418
you want it purposefully like go put

620
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,460
this in that [ __ ] up corner in your

621
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,080
room that's always got p.m. and see if

622
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,220
this grows in there if you've got a

623
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,960
friend that's always getting spider

624
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,700
mites we all know that guy that's always

625
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,230
got [ __ ] mites go tape give him a

626
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,779
couple of these clones see how the mites

627
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,950
react to this plant go in his room see

628
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,690
if they're well maybe don't go in there

629
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,610
don't go get his bugs you have him

630
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,380
report back go in there and look and see

631
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:19,109
are there a bunch of mites on the plants

632
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,190
all around it and this one has 50% as

633
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:24,750
many mites 20% as many mites anything

634
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,320
quantifiable is it quantifiable

635
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,700
quantitative cumulative qualitative any

636
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,990
way anything that you can [ __ ] see

637
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,250
with your eyes and write down with your

638
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,529
pen or you could text me and you could

639
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,849
say bro these plants you gave me are way

640
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,440
covered in mites and the other ones

641
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:38,908
aren't or you could say bro these plants

642
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,490
don't have any mites and all the other

643
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:43,440
plants are coded things like that find

644
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,140
that stuff out test your plants out see

645
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,120
what you've got then spread them out to

646
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,409
the world if they're good if not keep

647
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,408
them to yourself and keep playing with

648
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:54,330
them try to f2 it try to be exit maybe

649
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:56,549
select another mail and reread that mail

650
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,839
to everything else all over again if

651
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,609
you're breeding outdoors you only get

652
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,230
one shot every year at it hopefully

653
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,058
you've got an indoor grow that you can

654
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,740
grow these out in to play with

655
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,639
throughout the rest of the year and then

656
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,798
you can figure out what you're really

657
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,780
working with if you don't have the

658
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,220
ability to grow a bunch out maybe you

659
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,349
pass them out to some friends but make

660
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,160
sure those friends know like I said that

661
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:15,599
these are tests or

662
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,759
because you want to grow a lot you want

663
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,439
to grow large populations that's when

664
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,819
you see the truth that's when you see

665
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,990
what's really going on that's when you

666
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,480
start seeing the outliers

667
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,180
I've been putting out arise seeds for

668
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,410
several years now and for a long time I

669
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,490
saw a lot of very similar things and now

670
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,110
occasionally I'll get a picture somebody

671
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,329
will be like look what I found bro and

672
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,279
it's because I've put out so many seeds

673
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:41,970
of the arize that I'm starting to see

674
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:44,339
outliers we're getting 35% THCA outliers

675
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,410
we're getting crazy yielding outliers

676
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,929
we're getting some that have purple and

677
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,090
smell like a [ __ ] can of tennis balls

678
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,190
and burnt rubber I'm finding new things

679
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:54,929
because so many of them have been put

680
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,610
out now they're not common we don't see

681
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,920
it a lot it's usually that one that

682
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,750
looks like a golden goat plant with

683
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,220
golden goat leaves and a cushy structure

684
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,200
it's usually that thing that we see a

685
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,049
lot with the rise but now that it's out

686
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,950
there I'm starting to see these outliers

687
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,319
so I could rant on this forever

688
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,720
obviously but my point is grow a lot

689
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,490
grow as many as you can of course follow

690
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,490
your state laws be legal don't break any

691
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,230
rules I cannot condone or can encourage

692
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,390
you to break the law but you know grow

693
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,829
as many as you can cram a bunch and

694
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,540
there fill the trays fill the tables

695
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:25,439
grow a bunch of little plants see what

696
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,970
you've got you don't have to grow

697
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,450
gigantic plants if you just want to see

698
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,480
what you've got

699
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,309
grow some little ones you'll know grow

700
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,460
them in six-inch net pots you can fit a

701
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,210
lot of those under a 400 watt light grow

702
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,970
another tiny

703
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,230
flip them let them flower out if there

704
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,610
are homes you're gonna know pretty

705
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,049
quickly you'll know within three maybe

706
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,549
four weeks sometimes you gotta you gotta

707
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,200
wait till five or six weeks but some

708
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,750
will show you right away they'll just

709
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,190
throw these away some of them you're

710
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,839
gonna be able to tell these aren't worth

711
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,160
of [ __ ] some you're gonna go all I'm so

712
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,139
glad I bread this and then you're gonna

713
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,690
have a bag full of those seeds to play

714
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,350
with so grow as many as you can that's

715
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,820
my point

716
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,879
that's when you're gonna see what you've

717
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:06,240
really created then here's the hard part

718
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,350
if you have created something that just

719
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,940
sucks you can throw those seeds away or

720
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,169
you can give them away but make sure you

721
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,549
tell your friends like these aren't very

722
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,440
cool I'd rather you just throw them away

723
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:17,970
or feed them to a bird or if you get

724
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,559
some kind of pet or something just mix

725
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,720
them in with some bird feed or some [ __ ]

726
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,220
sprinkle them out in the yard or maybe

727
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,799
you could find some creative place to

728
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,049
sprinkle them but don't pass them along

729
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,059
for other people to grow thinking that

730
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,799
they're gonna grow high-quality medicine

731
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,589
when all you've really given them is

732
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,389
some schwag weed seeds we need to set

733
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:38,429
people up for success we need to do that

734
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,900
groundwork that legwork to find out what

735
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,730
we've got to find out if it's worth a

736
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,110
[ __ ] even if you're giving it to

737
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,970
somebody like I said earlier it cost

738
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,859
them money and they were expecting an

739
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,960
outcome you're giving them seeds and

740
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,279
they're gonna take their trust in you

741
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,200
you created something they're gonna

742
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,670
trust you that's like the mechanic put

743
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,720
in your [ __ ] tire honor the mechanic

744
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,980
doing something to your car they could

745
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,870
go totally wrong while you're flying

746
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,059
down the highway that wheel comes off

747
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,769
you're [ __ ] you trust that guy a lot

748
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,589
there that's how much they're trusting

749
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:07,680
you this crop could cost them a lot in

750
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,569
some places this crop could cost them

751
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,120
their freedom and they're growing our

752
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:13,710
bar seats the seeds we made in these

753
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,659
Gardens they're trusting us they're

754
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,150
gonna say Rasta Jeff put a lot of love

755
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,860
and research and care into these seeds I

756
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,850
trust that this is gonna be a usable

757
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,500
product in the end

758
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:24,449
and they're gonna put that into dirt

759
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,339
there's money they're gonna put they got

760
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,860
seeds that was money first off money

761
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:32,089
seeds then dirt then a container to put

762
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:35,909
the dirt in then lights to run [ __ ]

763
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:37,769
plants under then nutrients then all of

764
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,420
the time it takes your personal energy

765
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,039
you've got to run a fan you've got to

766
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,800
run a carbon filter you're investing a

767
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,269
lot of things let's give people

768
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,889
something that will turn out in the end

769
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:48,269
let's not give them a time bomb to waste

770
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,630
a bunch of money on they need a reward

771
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:53,940
in the end so if you've bred some [ __ ]

772
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,100
and you grew a bunch of it and you don't

773
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,600
see anything that impresses you don't

774
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,029
let your ego get in the way of you just

775
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,069
throwing those seeds away you bred

776
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,599
several crosses so hopefully the other

777
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:05,220
ones make up for it you don't have to

778
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,569
talk about that one he threw away that

779
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,009
disappeared that's gone what happened to

780
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:09,779
those seats they all sucked and I

781
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,579
flushed them or they all sucked and I

782
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,799
fed them to crazy Larry's parrot you

783
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,409
know whatever don't just don't put those

784
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,940
out or if you want to maybe you can f2

785
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,890
it and see if you can fix it

786
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,720
but that's kind of a waste of time when

787
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,680
you've got other quality genetics to

788
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,150
play with the

789
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,220
focus on the good ones focus on the

790
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,680
positive focus on the good [ __ ] that you

791
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,660
made with all the quality genetics were

792
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,370
playing with now Duds are uncommon but

793
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,830
there is always going to be the chance

794
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,239
that something just doesn't work people

795
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:38,789
have been breeding for a long time and

796
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,150
we still have people born with anomalies

797
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,980
so that goes for any type of breeding

798
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,560
plants animals anything where there's

799
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,500
genetics being crossed things can go

800
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,019
awry alright I think that was enough

801
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,759
ranting on one subject for one podcast

802
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,410
ona thank you for the great message that

803
