September 20th when I woke up today I

78
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,299
was oddly excited to check my newsfeed

80
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:15,120
world because today is the start of the

81
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:16,019
raid on area 51 um there's a lot we

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
could talk about here I don't wanna go

83
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,590
too long on this because this is just a

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,879
beautiful story and it's fun it's

85
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,430
entertaining so there is a raid on area

86
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,810
51 let's talk briefly about area 51 a

87
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,689
long time ago I don't know the year I

88
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,549
didn't do any research maybe possibly

89
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,799
some aliens crashed in Roswell New

90
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,569
Mexico maybe I don't know allegedly I

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,370
I'm not even gonna [ __ ] go down that

92
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:41,158
path we asked Eddie Bravo about that

93
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,658
[ __ ] so maybe some aliens crashed there

94
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:48,000
was a museum and also a base made based

95
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:51,448
on this discovery or this findings of

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,239
these alien parts area 51 is where the

97
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,540
spacecraft and all the [ __ ] was taken

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,560
the crime scene was moved to area 51

99
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:03,179
capital allegedly yeah yeah yeah but if

100
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,098
they didn't it that isn't the story that

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,510
none of the other part adds up so a lot

102
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,518
of people think there are aliens there

103
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,348
they've moved all the aliens stuff the

104
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,090
crafts the bodies all that [ __ ] is there

105
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:15,418
the iPhone was made there I'm just

106
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,548
joking with that part so a alien UFO

107
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:22,079
crash all the stuff gets moved to area

108
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:24,810
51 area 51 is a real US military base

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,100
for a hundred percent for sure it's a

110
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,899
real military installation and

111
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,080
research facility that absolutely is

112
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,909
there it exists it's on the map so much

113
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,649
that people are their offenses guards

114
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:41,110
gates guns and dogs so dogs one day not

115
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:43,810
so long ago a guy who I won't say his

116
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,960
name went to the barn had just the right

117
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,420
amount of drinks the exact right number

118
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
of drinks and she's already kind of made

119
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,330
history

120
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,979
he went home yeah just the right amount

121
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:56,019
of [ __ ] drinks he went home and he

122
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,160
posted to a social media platform that

123
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:04,449
we should raid area 51 and clap some

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,070
alien butt cheeks if we all show up at

125
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,229
once they can't stop us all right yes

126
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:12,069
it's the same theory behind like amp

127
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,230
fest so alright alright maybe slightly

128
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:16,779
different but yes okay if a hundred

129
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,520
thousand people show up to do one do

130
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:22,000
something together like there's almost

131
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,039
nothing that authorities can do to stop

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,660
that thing from happening right except

133
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,580
this is a military base I bet their [ __ ]

134
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,590
they can do so they have ways of

135
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,539
stopping that this guy goes online and

136
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,639
he decides that he wants to collapse an

137
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,740
alien butt cheeks and like mike said if

138
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,870
i think he said a million people if we

139
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,420
can get a million people they can't stop

140
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,629
us and so he started what was known as

141
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,560
the raid on area 51 and it was meant to

142
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,180
be a joke

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,100
i get started it's just a funny little

144
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,780
internet joke dude that a funny drunk

145
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,670
thought on his way to passing out and

146
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:53,319
decided to actually share it two more

147
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,640
beers he would have got to pornhub four

148
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,129
more beers he wouldn't've made it home

149
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,419
from the bar three less beers and he

150
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:00,610
probably would have tried to watch TV

151
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,930
instead of Facebook that night and none

152
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,170
of this [ __ ] would have just the right

153
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,819
amount of its beer and burritos and yeah

154
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,680
it all came out just right so this dude

155
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,399
post this post and it actually caught on

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,230
people like [ __ ] yeah the social media

157
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,310
network era that we live in if you don't

158
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,500
know what we're talking about get off

159
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,509
and under that [ __ ] rock you've been

160
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,629
under yes has been everywhere for months

161
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:26,349
so today is the day he said let's all

162
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:29,259
gather days the day area 51 and raid

163
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,750
area 51 so eventually he said eventually

164
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,579
the government said hey [ __ ] it

165
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,410
happened pretty quick this blew up fast

166
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,289
and the government came out right away

167
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,570
and said by the way folks this is a real

168
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,290
government installation with real rules

169
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,899
and if you try to rush it past the gates

170
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,689
we really will use lethal force to stop

171
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:52,000
you they went so far in their statement

172
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,060
as to saying we don't have rubber

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,250
bullets here we shoot you with live ammo

174
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,959
and you die they don't use crowd control

175
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,279
toys to keep people from rushing under

176
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,159
military installations yeah it's

177
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,439
military this is not a civilian control

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,590
thing this is an attack and you have

179
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,529
said raid and attack we will defend and

180
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:13,719
they don't [ __ ] around they got the [ __ ]

181
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,269
around it oh yeah they will put holes in

182
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,820
you who knows what they've got there if

183
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,250
this is really the alien storage

184
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,420
whatever what what the [ __ ] do they have

185
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,470
there to protect that they might have a

186
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,509
button let it go

187
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,910

188
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,860
guns in a whole lot of like medium sized

189
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,020
guns what I've seen in the press the

190
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,300
dogs that I've seen are enough to keep

191
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,579
me the dog throws to the people that are

192
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,199

193
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,629

194
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,060
as me that dog weighs as much as I do

195
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,579

206
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,269
little bit back on track here today is

207
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,650
the day they're all gathered up the

208
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:10,719
government knew we were coming

209
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,669
there's like 1500 people is what I was

210
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,360
reading in the two little towns closest

211
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:19,210
the area 51 and like 150 or 200 people

212
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,220
have made their way down a little dirt

213
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,659
ass back row so that's another side

214
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,760
thing we should touch on this guy

215
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,350
finally realized after the government

216
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,589
came out said well [ __ ] kill you he

217
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:32,529
went oh yeah maybe maybe we shouldn't do

218
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,779
that and so he decided to be a

219
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,720
capitalist in a modern-day world and

220
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,220
turn his prank into a profitable

221
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,110
business and he tried to create a

222
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,970
festival out of it he actually tried to

223
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,060
turn it into a music festival

224
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,379
unfortunately ah he was just a drunk

225
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,119
dude that posted some [ __ ] so you had no

226
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,189
ability to throw her fast if you build

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,929
it sometimes they don't come yeah he

228
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,280
didn't want it he did not want to fire

229
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:56,109
everybody uh I haven't

230
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,539

231
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,580
everybody up so he did not do his fire

232
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,230
festival I know I know but some other

233
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,139
people took it upon themselves to do

234
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,810
small local things this is a 5% of

235

Burning Man yeah it's a bunch of yeah

236
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,799

237
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:13,750
small fish concerts parking lots

238
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,879

239

249
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,450

254
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,329
get a tan right bunch of trip and

255

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,490
possession I saw one guy has already

257
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,840
been arrested for peeing near the gate

258
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,340
so so far at this point don't pee

259
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,649
towards soldiers it will get you

260
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,000
arrested and about 3 o'clock in the

261
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,919
morning people started showing up and

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,509
gathering around the gate and they were

263
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,740
greeted by armed guards who are like

264
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,809

274
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,259

275
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:29,139

276

287
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,480
that's trying to give first aid but the

288
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,210

if now I'm primal this is my property

296
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:15,850
that's the thing about guard duty is its

297
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:19,059
99.9% wishing [ __ ] what happened cuz

299
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,629

300
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,610
video were very polite they were

301
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:25,659

bunch of extra people on duty as oh yeah

306

324
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,229
reasonable chance that tonight a bunch

325
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:15,519
of people get drunk and like six of them

326
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,470
roll and go [ __ ] tequila running at

327
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,870
the gate

328
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,610
the dude who is charming and talking to

329
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,240
people this morning might have to kill

330
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,070
like eight idiots tonight so you never

331
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,779
[ __ ] know when you're that guy I

332
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,610
think when he goes for eight I think

333
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,559
once he crosses like the four to five

334
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,389
maybe six threshold I think it's just

335
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,679
happy fire after that dude I think he

336
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:40,210
just turned it into the end of [ __ ]

337
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,349
true romance at that point you don't you

338
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,580
don't have an assault rifle and you

339
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,750
didn't just cross the line I think there

340
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,520
might be something in that man's head

341
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,289
that might just accidentally go they

342
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,460
were all coming at me they everybody

343
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,839
looks like they're coming at you once

344
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,310
you start firing it's like once you got

345
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,920
a hammer everything looks like a nail I

346
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,589
think that guy may just enjoy it so so

347
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,240
far nothing has happened but yeah like I

348
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,730
hope nothing happens tonight I have no

349
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,899
faith and ninety to me the night no you

350
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,180

352
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:07,629
bunch of people from all across the

353
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,610
country possibly the world who have

354
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:11,200
never been to the desert where it was

355

359
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,700

360
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:21,589
be bored and restless by the end of

361

393
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,210
find my next move and it's not available

394
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,829
yeah it's gonna be plenty of funny

395
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,269
coming down the pipe from this as long

396
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,570
as a bunch of people don't rush the

397
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:38,419
gates and then an entirely different

398
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,710
sort of funny happens yeah I was the

399
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,789
part of the sick twisted part of me was

400
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,509
gonna say I don't know Mike that's when

401
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:46,399
the funny really begins you just nodded

402
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:50,539
in silence all right let's move on from

403
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:55,100
the butt cheeks let's talk about some

404
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:56,929
real cannabis related stuff this that

405
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,940
has to be a cannabis related story at

406
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,889
least tangentially yeah they're people

407
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,170
out there smoking weed smoking some

408
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,389
alien OG half those memes were inspired

409
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:11,089
by cannabis the aliens brought us the

410
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:12,319
weed but no I'm just kidding so here's

411
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,490
something that has been popping up in

412
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,190
the news again I've been avoiding

413
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,750
talking about this subject because I am

414
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,970
NOT a doctor I'm not a scientist but

415
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,529
I've done some reading Mike brought this

416
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,889
up and said we should talk about this on

417
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,569
the show there is a syndrome a thing

418
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,909
that is happening it is known and I'm

419
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,860
going to pronounce it incorrectly but

420
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:31,909
that's okay because if you've never

421
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,960
heard the word before

422
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:34,250
it doesn't matter from saying it wrong

423
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,210
or not and it only matters that we're

424
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,470
talking about this

425
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,639
I'm giving you the information I've

426
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,350
heard it said a couple of different ways

427
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,289
we're gonna talk about a syndrome called

428
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,120
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome I've also

429
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:46,069
heard it pronounced cannabis hyperemesis

430
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,169
syndrome however you want to say it

431
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,850
we're gonna call it CHS for this episode

432
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:52,759
it's much much easier we'll get much

433
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:56,810
less criticism there is a syndrome that

434
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:59,990
is being labeled CHS it is popping up

435
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:03,109
all over the country but most commonly

436
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,600
in places where we have done some sort

437
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,120
of cannabis decriminalization and made

438
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,750
cannabis available to people I believe

439
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,610
part of that we're gonna get into that

440
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,370
it's not so much localized around

441
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,129
legalization it's just that's where you

442
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,460
read about it right because the people

443
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:25,309
there can say they consume cannabis well

444
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,259
in any place that's legalized it's in

445
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,419
vogue to blame every problem you stumble

446
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:32,090
across on legal weed and lazy Doc's is

447
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:35,000
my third note so that's yeah but yeah

448
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,560
it's also we can say yeah we do smoke a

449
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,990
lot of weed here is you can't say that

450
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,149
if you live in some other place and so

451
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,379
and then also doctors are lazy they go

452
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,939
you got dreadlocks and smoke a lot of

453
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:47,570
weed you've got CHS that's your problem

454
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:50,660
so the symptoms a lot of times the

455
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:53,420
symptoms include a very crappy stomach

456
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:55,610
and nausea and vomiting and muscle

457
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:57,829
tension and a headache and a burning

458
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,129
sensation in your skin or in your body

459
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,710
and there are other random symptoms that

460
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:06,440
some patients do report and some

461
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,210
patients do not report some people feel

462
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,820
itchy some people feel like their skin

463
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:14,329
is crawly but the main complaints are

464
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,259
stomach problems and a stomach cramps

465
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,629
nausea repeated bouts of vomiting and

466
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,879
the the kicker that the doctors are

467
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,310
looking for is if the symptoms are

468
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,930
relieved or baited with hot showers

469
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,730
right for some reason it gives you the

470
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,830
urge to take a hot shower and the hot

471
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,000
showers will help it which is really

472
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:33,289
weird because one of my favorite things

473
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,509
I just go randomly take a hot shower

474
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,639
I've done the kids on my own this is

475
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:39,109
strange they came across that because

476
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,970
like when you're riding in agony or

477
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:43,009
whatever your mind starts going through

478
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,259
the rolodex - oh [ __ ] how do we get this

479
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,849
to stop yeah and one of the things that

480
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,269
people have reported that works is hot

481
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,519
chow

482
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,960
and so they're they're doing a couple of

483
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,750
different things to treat it they're

484
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,009
doing something with capsaicin and

485
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,240
mainly it's just hydrate you and tell

486
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,490
you to lay off whatever you've been

487
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,730
smoking until the symptoms of bay is all

488
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,769
anybody's doing right there's not like a

489
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,569
drug that they found that makes it

490
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,879
better or or anything like that that

491
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:13,250
they can give you it's just you have to

492
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,410
stop consuming cannabis and in hydrate

493
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,710
and just give it time and as whatever's

494
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:21,200
in your system passes they they're

495
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,870
blaming THC right now but it's I really

496
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,890
highly doubt that that's my next note so

497
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,419
so pause um [ __ ] I forgot I was gonna

498
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,280
say because I told you to pause well

499
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,590
that's like that's what's up with the

500
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:37,039
syndrome if you're not familiar with it

501
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,449
you can look CHS up I we're talking

502
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,859
about it right now because just what do

503
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,519
you want to do a show about today and I

504
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:45,139
said before I was CHS has any news um so

505
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,000
you'll be able to find out more specific

506
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,460
information about it if you'd like so

507
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,200
it's popping up people are getting CHS

508
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,480
people that have smoked for a long time

509
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,890
are suddenly developing CHS like they've

510
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,579
been like folks like myself who have

511
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,440
smoked for years and years it's not like

512
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:02,058
sixteen-year-old sneaks out of house

513
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,460
smokes first joint with friends comes

514
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,289
home it has CHS right well it could be

515
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,829
that could occur as well but that's not

516
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,299
as common

517
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:10,129
no one's reporting that yet right

518
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:12,259
because they're probably just thinking

519
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,820
if that does happen they also just think

520
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,349
I'm just too [ __ ] high for my first

521
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,210
time it's probably what they attribute

522
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:19,308
that to so yeah it is popping up in

523
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,860
folks that smoke like myself and Mike's

524
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:24,200
level like a daily or a frequent or a

525
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:26,859
like a regular consumer somebody that

526
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,240
smokes a lot so it's popping up in

527
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:32,119
random places and the only way to stop

528
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,710
it for a short time as these hot showers

529
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,869
and then quit smoking and kind of clean

530
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,880
out your system some people report that

531
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,259
it comes back immediately some people

532
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,550
say that it doesn't come back some

533
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,039
people say that it will come back later

534
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:45,589
on so it's kind of strange and kind of

535
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,990
random at that sort of a thing now the

536
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:49,808
next thing that we should be that's part

537
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,380
of the reason this has been so hard to

538
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:55,819
to nail down and describe as a this

539
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,850
cific illness or something that's being

540
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:01,429
caused by whatever is because it's it's

541
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:05,059
characterized by the symptoms we've said

542
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,310
but the to get a diagnosis the people

543
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,500
have to go back to the ER over and over

544
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,089
and over again with they showed up

545
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,569
because it kind of presents like extreme

546
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:16,699
food poisoning and stomach cramps which

547
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:20,509
is typically those symptoms are

548
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,069
alleviated with hot showers - it's not

549
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:26,210
until you've come back to the ER three

550
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:27,799
or four times and they start asking

551
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,640
about your cannabis use that they

552
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,230
decided to diagnose it as CHS and

553
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,240
recommends stopping all cannabis

554
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,799
consumption - see what that does occur

555
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,920
for several weeks and I think excuse

556
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,289
that that was terrible I'm sorry I think

557
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,940
that a lot of that is a doctor getting

558
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,379
lazy and getting tired of seeing you and

559
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,480
being like we don't have a real

560
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,760
diagnosis for you it would be easy just

561
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,220
to slap this CHS label on there so there

562
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,569
you go you say you smoke that's probably

563
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,299
what's doing it so I think part of that

564
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:03,109
is laziness what I really think is

565
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,480
excuse my throat you guys I apologize

566
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:09,769
that's rude podcaster throat what I

567
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,970
really think is the root cause of CHS is

568
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:16,519
honestly a pesticide exposure I really

569
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,019
think I've got worker protection safety

570
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,670
training from the department the

571
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,950
Colorado Department of Agriculture and

572
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,800
the Colorado State University of Pueblo

573
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,890
I am train-the-trainer certified I am

574
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,079
certified and going to anywhere that

575
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,160
uses pesticides any sort of agricultural

576
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:36,049
facility I can train the staff on

577
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,600
pesticide handling and pesticide

578
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,869
application and pesticide safety on a

579
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,369
professional commercial horticulture

580
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:45,709
level I understand pesticides I

581
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,719
understand pesticide application I think

582
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,460
I made my point I've read a lot about

583
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,130
pesticides in what happens when you were

584
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,160
exposed to them I think that the

585
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:58,160
symptoms of CHS directly match the

586
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,080
symptoms of as a direct and poisoning

587
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,509
and has interact and exposure they're

588
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,519
very much the same symptoms they're

589
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,960
parallel and I think people common is

590
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,930
this product use in cannabis

591
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,329
it is one of the most common pesticides

592
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:16,110
and that's when I first started reading

593
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:18,659
about these cases I thought well it's

594
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:21,899
not the THC because humans have been

595
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,580
using THC in concentrated forms look if

596
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,910
you don't know the history of cannabis

597
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:31,199
and hash you can look this [ __ ] up but

598
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,730
before the 1920s eating hash was wildly

599
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,340
popular there's a book called the hash

600
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,589
eaters it's even in the Count of Monte

601
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:42,389
Cristo they eating hash is one of the

602
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:45,089
subplots and so it's the the odds that

603
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:48,780
there's an illness with symptoms this

604
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:51,179
severe that's caused directly by THC or

605
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,259
CBD or one of the other cannabinoids is

606
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,049
highly unlikely

607
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:58,440
what is extremely likely is that there's

608
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:01,289
something that's in common use like neem

609
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,799
oil or something else that [ __ ]

610
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:07,019
everybody uses at least for a while neem

611
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,700
oil is not super popular now but for a

612
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,099
minute everyone and their brother had

613
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,740
neem in their [ __ ] garage a lot of

614
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,199
other folks are attributing neem oil to

615
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,730
this syndrome I'm I think they're

616
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,279
attached I think neem and has a direct

617
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,720
and are the same if not similar I should

618
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:26,309
read that before I say that but they're

619
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,370
attached somehow but that's a lot of

620
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:32,399
people suspect a lot of people in the

621
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:35,009
cannabis communities prime suspects is

622
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,120
something that we're adding to cannabis

623
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:41,700
for one reason or another and it's this

624
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,469
ties in with the the vaping story that's

625
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,660
going on right now too

626
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,950
there's a concerted effort by people in

627
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,150
the media and people in the anti

628
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,990
marijuana world to to pin the vaping

629
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,940
stuff on THC or vaping period and that's

630
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,220
clearly nonsense it's clearly an

631
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,860
additive that's causing us

632
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,420
the two main not focusing on that's

633
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,769
going to cause us problems so everyone

634
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,120
in the community needs to be aware that

635
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,639
we're talking about stuff that's being

636
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,199
added to our cannabis not cannabis I

637
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,690
don't want to say added that's going to

638
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,450
sound like it's being added sprayed a

639
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,130
plant live fed - it's being sprayed as

640
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,069
an intention as a

641
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,860
pest preventative or a pest deterrent

642
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:25,079
and it's being applied too late or too

643
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,029
heavily and it's being applied

644
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,589
improperly is basically what's happening

645
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:30,509
I did a quick google search the two main

646
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:32,399
active ingredients derived from the neem

647
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,009
tree seeds are as interacting and

648
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,410
clarified hydrophobic extract of neem

649
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,480
oil also referred to simply as neem oil

650
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,390
so yes Niemann has interact and are one

651
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,670
in the same just an extract of the other

652
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,680
one so it's that's what the symptoms are

653
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,600
coming from when I typed in the word as

654
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,730
interacting the first thing that came up

655
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,740
were poisoning symptoms and if you look

656
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,200
it is very similar to what we're looking

657
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,500
at with CH s and then you asked if that

658
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,509
is a product that is used in Sue's

659
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,920
[ __ ] everywhere everything with a za

660
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:03,990
at the start of it and I don't

661
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,470
I feel bad mentioning the products but

662
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,890
as whatever is made with hazard Arango

663
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:13,680
yeah and but one of them two of them I'm

664
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,140
thinking quickly I can think of at least

665
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,870
three as interact and derived products

666
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,670
that are allowed by the Colorado

667
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:22,829
marijuana Enforcement Division and the

668
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,450
Colorado Department of Agriculture so

669
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,349
I'm gonna Lou back to something I was

670
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,860
talking about a minute ago about

671
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:31,679
improper pesticide application there is

672
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,990
what is known as the re-entry interval

673
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,210
when you apply a pesticide if I spray

674
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,400
most products have a four or an eight

675
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,049
hour most of things that I would use

676
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,820
have got a four or an eight hour

677
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,099
re-entry interval if I spray that

678
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,169
product in my garden I have to leave and

679
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:48,449
unless you are in the proper protective

680
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,730
equipment you should not enter that grow

681
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,590
room for four to eight hours because

682
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,299
that pesticide is active in there if you

683
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:56,309
touch the plants you risk getting a

684
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,079
pesticide contamination on your skin if

685
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,269
it is still in their field was sprayed

686
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,099
and micronized bubbles you can still

687
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:06,900
inhale that into your lungs you can get

688
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:09,089
exposure that re-entry interval needs to

689
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,890
be lengthened in our indoor grow

690
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,779
environments because we don't have wind

691
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,370
and we don't have Sun those pesticides

692
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,859
are not getting broken down by the

693
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:19,199
natural response yeah they're just

694
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,089
hanging out on the plants so people are

695
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,830
spraying too often when there's no

696
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:25,199
absorbs like when you're spraying

697
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:27,000
outside [ __ ] drips out of the soil it's

698
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,620
gonna absorb and diffuse into the

699
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,470
topsoil other sun's gonna break it down

700
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,000
the Sun

701
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,169
is gonna destroy most of what we're

702
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
putting out there it's gonna break it

703
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:35,890
down there just like it is written to do

704
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,380
inside the drips gather like in the

705
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,940
little rain gutters and they just yeah

706
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,640
like there's there's no absorption

707
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,009
there's nothing that just sits and

708
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,659
there's no wind they just gathered ups

709
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:49,929
and then we apply again and we apply

710
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:51,870
again and we apply again and that is

711
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:55,000
where there is too much pesticide

712
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:56,379
gathered up on our flower or I've talked

713
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,630
about this also in a previous episode

714
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,760
we're taking plants that have been

715
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,620
sprayed a little bit too late and we're

716
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,569
like [ __ ] man this this this crops got

717
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,459
bugs on it and I've been spraying it I

718
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,710
can't get rid of the bugs and then you

719
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,990
make an executive decision around week 8

720
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,220
man this can't go 10 weeks these bugs

721
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,750
are gonna eat this [ __ ] how to bring it

722
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,769
down early got it but then you know what

723
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,720
else we got to do with it because it

724
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:19,089
came down early no no no no turn it into

725
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,130
oil but also we just sprayed it four

726
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:23,730
weeks ago three weeks ago so now what

727
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,169
are you gonna do we're also gonna make

728
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,450
concentrated as interacting in my oil

729
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,130
yeah yeah sometimes I can see it and

730
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,798
some in some concentrates I can identify

731
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,600
the floaties pesticide but so you apply

732
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,099
that pesticide you take down the crop a

733
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,658
little bit early because it wasn't a

734
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:40,178
plan you've got bugs it's got to come

735
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:41,799
down you've got early flowers nobody

736
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,390
wants to buy premature flowers you

737
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:44,950
turned it into concentrate you've just

738
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,409
made concentrate with contaminated

739
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,200
flowers now you're going to get cannabis

740
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:52,210
hyperemesis syndrome from consuming that

741
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,980
as interact and latent concentrate I

742
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,100
think that is what's making people sick

743
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,860
to tell you the truth the part of the

744
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:03,279
this whole topic that drives me just up

745
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:05,798
the wall is like when it's cantaloupe

746
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,329
that's making people say like seven

747
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:09,940
eight people get sick and we're like

748
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:13,629
it's Billy's cantaloupe farm in like

749
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,390
Billy Carolina that produced it and sold

750
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,120
it and they [ __ ] up step 7 and these

751
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,179
people got sick and those families sue

752
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,889
the company and life goes on like

753
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,880
because it's a legal regulated product

754
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:31,059
that goes through standard testing and

755
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,200
inspections when stuff sold like that

756
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:36,940
they can track it back right away like

757
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,769
when they had scares in the 80s and the

758
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,279
90s where people [ __ ] with tylenol

759
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:43,089
bottles and [ __ ] on the shelf when

760
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,920
somebody would buy a

761
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:47,980
a time all that had been tampered with

762
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,960
they were immediately able to say that

763
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,740
bottle of Tylenol came from Billy's

764
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,660
drugstore

765
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,730
Billy's drugstore got their shipment of

766
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,410
time off from Timmy's warehouse yeah

767
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,349
Timmy's warehouse got their [ __ ] from

768
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,269
the tylenol Factory 17 that's right here

769
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:02,919
they go to town on Factory 17 they

770
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,059
talked to the 15 guys that were working

771
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,680
the day that bottle went through the

772
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:07,690
line

773
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,990
that's what legal and regulated means

774
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,720
and as cannabis moves all the way into

775
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,160
that market we're finally gonna get the

776
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,019
protections that should have [ __ ]

777
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,519
been there our whole lives right on the

778
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:19,839
I've grabbed this concentrate container

779
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,700
here on the back of this one I've got

780
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,869
I'm not gonna read the numbers exactly

781
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,580
but I've got an RM CF &amp; RM IP and then a

782
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,739
couple of other numbers one of these

783
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:32,559
numbers was the cultivation facility the

784
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,660
RM CF is the RM the recreational

785
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,549
marijuana cultivation facility I've got

786
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,800
a number there so I know where this was

787
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:41,049
cultivated I know what which grow these

788
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:45,339
flowers came from then I've got an RM IP

789
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:47,559
a recreational marijuana infused product

790
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:49,000
facility Wow proud of myself for that

791
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,009
one I've got a number there so I know

792
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,720
who grew this and I knew who extracted

793
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:58,359
it with this RM CF number if I wanted to

794
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,940
I could request their pesticide

795
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:04,779
application logs which they're required

796
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,150
to keep for a minimum of 2 years so if a

797
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:09,190
problem occurred from this batch of

798
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,440
concentrate I could tell you what was

799
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,500
applied to their garden for the past two

800
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,720
years if they were honest they're

801
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,420
supposed to write all of that [ __ ] down

802
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,150
the trick there is just apply some [ __ ]

803
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,970
and don't write it down how do we defeat

804
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,269
that mic morose inspections more regs

805
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,009
lab testing and inspections now the

806
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,839
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

807
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,759
has a couple of new machines that

808
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,679
they're just loving to [ __ ] use they

809
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,079
show up to your grow and they dress up

810
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,210
like their goddamn CSI and they go in

811
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,639
the grow and they cut off a leaf from

812
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,710
one or two plants and they denote plant

813
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,420
number six there the numbers are where

814
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,799
the other plants are all tagged with a

815
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,480
specific number already so they just

816
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,269
write that number down plant number six

817
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,519
that bottom third main branch of the

818
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,349
plant we took this leaf they put in a

819
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,589
little evidence bag it says evidence it

820
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:59,048
looks

821
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:01,089
[ __ ] crime back they take a few

822
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:03,009
samples throughout the entire grow bill

823
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:04,959
just pick random places and they'll take

824
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:06,639
samples and they'll write it down they

825
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,009
get all of the grower information the

826
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:10,628
owner information they check so much

827
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:12,308
stuff then they take those samples back

828
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:14,740
to a lab and they test them for a

829
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:16,898
pesticide contamination and if those

830
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,569
plants are tested for improper pesticide

831
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:21,518
application there are repercussions for

832
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:24,128
that garden it could be destroyed the

833
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,808
entire garden can be taken down yep yeah

834
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:28,058
and though they'll send people down to

835
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:30,368
watch you shred your [ __ ] or they'll

836
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:32,678
help you do it [ __ ] help you shred

837
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:35,189
those plants the the two people I know

838
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,659
that have been through that process um

839
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,580
the guys they sent to watch everything

840
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:41,350
get shredded we're just asking stupid

841
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:43,808
questions fault I'm making it worse on

842
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:45,609
the part that shred it I bet oh man meb

843
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:47,378
is a fun group of people I love you guys

844
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,378
okay I mean like this is what happens

845
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:52,959
like this is what we mean when we say

846
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:54,878
legal cannabis like legal beer don't

847
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,009
make people say if you know the history

848
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:59,199
of prohibition one of the really [ __ ]

849
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,639
up things that happened was a lot of the

850
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,028
alcohol people were drinking during

851
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:05,949
Prohibition was [ __ ] poison and why is

852
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:08,888
it poisoned because the black market

853
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:12,069
cares about profit yep in like I get it

854
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:15,038
I was I [ __ ] it I was part of the black

855
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:16,118
market like tangentially fundamentally

856
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,499
it's where I came from that's why

857
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:19,178
sometimes I try to stand up for the

858
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:21,038
black market I understand that I've got

859
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:22,809
compassion for the black market without

860
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,710
the black market in some places there is

861
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:32,648
no market that's 100% true and for the

862
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:35,710
cannabis community for so long we we had

863
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:40,109
no other option and so we made the best

864
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:42,579
black market we could like everybody

865
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,528
trusts and respects their dealer for the

866
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:45,730
most part when it comes to cannabis like

867
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:49,808
I don't think that's necessarily true

868
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:51,548
for a lot of other harder drugs but a

869
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:53,408
lot of those smokers I know especially

870
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:55,118
in the black market days like had a fun

871
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:57,759
relationship with whoever their guy was

872
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:59,408
and always went back to that one spot

873
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,329
and we've really carried some of that

874
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:03,940
through into the legal market where we

875
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:07,720
pick a dispensary and we stay with that

876
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,190
chain or or that outfit for as long as

877
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,200
we can before

878
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,940
changing it up and I think some of

879
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,870
that's making somebody's life a demyx

880
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,490
worse like the CHS thing if you're

881
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:22,299
buying product that's tainted with the

882
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:24,609
pesticide from shop a like odds are

883
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:26,409
strong that their whole grow is treated

884
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:28,289
with whatever is making you sick right

885
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,370
so as you move from flower to flower

886
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,839
concentrate to concentrate as long as

887
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:34,659
you're going back and buying from that

888
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,250
specific store whatever's in their

889
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,040
supply chain that's [ __ ] with you is

890
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,569
gonna keep [ __ ] with you and right

891
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,399
now odds are pretty good that it's

892
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:45,669
something that the whole industry is

893
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,830
using legal and illegal but I believe

894
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,390
strongly but the whole industry is using

895
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:51,819
as a direct and based on mean based

896
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,710
products dude I can be as such a strong

897
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:54,309
testament to your loyalty as what you're

898
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,100
talking about

899
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,899
once you do find a shop or a weed guy

900
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:00,459
you keep going there and if you look at

901
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,190
my table there are two brands all over

902
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,470
the table that's why they've never done

903
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,570
me wrong there's shit's always proper

904
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,300
and I don't feel sick from it so I mean

905
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:13,630
like right now I've never felt and we're

906
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,269
gonna make it [ __ ] paranoid from this

907
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,700
podcast I've got this syndrome now sorry

908
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:21,789
we did that to you guys know how Haley

909
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,389
really rough on my lungs like I smoked

910
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:25,119
tobacco

911
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm bong hits or my favorite method or

912
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,000
you send a recommendation for coughing

913
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,099
like a [ __ ] savage on the show right

914
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,639
so I had like I haven't even converted

915
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:34,809
over to concentrates which like if you

916
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,150
haven't figured out that vaping

917
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:39,070
concentrates is a lot less wear and tear

918
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,980
on your lungs than smoking a joint for

919
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:44,800
the same amount of stone like you just

920
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,809
haven't been thinking about it and still

921
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,340
I prefer bong hits I don't know why it's

922
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:52,900
just it's too perfect to give up but

923
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:56,650
I've had vape pens where I take a couple

924
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:59,050
of puffs on it and I just feel like my

925
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:03,070
lungs feel soggy or squishy for the next

926
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,900
hour day and a half and like I didn't

927
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,039
mind losing those cards I'm [ __ ]

928
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,110
terrible with carts that's why I don't

929
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,309
do oh the Fate pen cartridges you lose

930
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,440
those too I know a couple other people

931
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,119
that are like that I can I can keep on

932
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,159
to him I got seven batteries at home no

933
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,849
carts I haven't finished a cart in like

934
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:22,409
four years man um but immediately I knew

935
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:24,598
that that was a product where

936
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:26,368
in industry on the margins or an

937
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,510
industry that squeezed as hard as the

938
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:32,818
legal cannabis industry is a lot of the

939
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,819
carts are where they're they're d- and

940
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:37,980
failed product ends up in the black

941
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:40,190
market who the [ __ ] knows what's in

942
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,519
those things they're finding carts with

943
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:46,679
k2 and spice in it and these are like

944
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:51,019
they found that [ __ ] in CBD carts in

945
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:54,509
[ __ ] Texas they found k2 in the carts

946
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:55,949
they found that [ __ ] Massa to mask too I

947
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,470
think

948
00:35:55,949 --> 00:36:00,239
just know if you're buying black market

949
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:02,939
stick the flour yep you can look at

950
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,588
flour you can smell flour you can see

951
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,358
problems with the flour through the bag

952
00:36:04,588 --> 00:36:08,338
in a quick transaction there are ways

953
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,779
that we've all learned to protect

954
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,230
ourselves buying flour in the black

955
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,140
market

956
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:17,269
right um concentrates if you're buying

957
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:20,639
legit hash you can you can look and see

958
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:21,230
quality versus not quality once it's in

959
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,759
a cart

960
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,949
ya know that could be that could be piss

961
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,528
in there now with the dispensaries they

962
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:30,449
are now before I get to the dispensary

963
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:32,460
part they are now doing concentrate

964
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:34,679
tests until recently I think it may have

965
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,500
been September first they did not have

966
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,239
to test the concentrate this is just the

967
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,949
flour so now they're also testing a

968
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,348
sample of the concentrate so if the

969
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:45,358
concentrate does happen to get an

970
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,950
abundance of pesticide concentrated they

971
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,838
don't get notice now so they're testing

972
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:51,389
for that as well another thing that is

973
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:53,460
happening to keep us safer they are

974
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:55,019
doing random dispensary tests they're

975
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,789
going to dispensaries a little spot

976
00:36:55,019 --> 00:37:00,389
check bus and spot rings and [ __ ]

977
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:01,799
doing that wise they're going in like

978
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:03,538
Health Department and checking the

979
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:05,699
flower they're pulling flour out of the

980
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,200
jar and testing it for microbes and cuz

981
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,118
decides yeah they're doing checks on the

982
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,759
actual flower that is in the jar on the

983
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,619
shelf now who's I've singing because

984
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,500
[ __ ] can happen you and I know what can

985
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,660
happen from zero because it gets sealed

986
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,338
up depends on how your grow is it

987
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,199
probably goes in a [ __ ] turkey bag

988
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,480
and it gets sealed up in a turkey bag

989
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,788
and driven in the back of Mike's car

990
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,528
from the growth facility to the

991
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,970
dispensary and then somebody at the

992
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:31,409
dispensary checks it in and puts it into

993
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,969
a different container and then I don't

994
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:35,519
know if they get sealed airtight if it

995
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:36,009
gets left open to the Container you wash

996
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,929
from

997
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,450
last batch somebody sneezed matches

998
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:42,549
before did we wash their hands after

999
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:46,569
using the [ __ ] before they did da

1000
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:49,360
bagon like all of that if this [ __ ]

1001
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,820
we've seen we're talking about in the

1002
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,400
legal market has your ears perked up or

1003
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,809
your your gag reflex kicking in just

1004
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,300
imagine the [ __ ] we've seen in the

1005
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:01,570
purely legal market some destroyed trees

1006
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,580
have a dry and cure it in the jar sort

1007
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,350
of a theory so I've been asked to take

1008
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:07,150
my shoes off and grind the plant

1009
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:12,730
material that was stuck to the bottom of

1010
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:15,730
them over a plate 2-0 rags for quality

1011
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,889
control um like everybody I know that's

1012
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:20,260
been involved in the black market long

1013
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:21,909
enough to do with brick weed has stories

1014
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,270
about insane [ __ ] they found in their

1015
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:26,369
brick nuts bolts a [ __ ] bird

1016
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,539
pinecones

1017
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:32,440
anything to make you weigh anything to

1018
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:34,389
make you look right and like stuff had

1019
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,429
soda dumped out over it and then dried

1020
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:39,009
in the Sun to give it more sticky that's

1021
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:40,419
how they used to pour sugar water over

1022
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,040
and put in a trash compactor it's not

1023
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,579
they used to compress like a brick weed

1024
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:48,190
there's endless nasty that we've just

1025
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:51,309
been like [ __ ] but it's that or no herb

1026
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:53,110
you know like in is legalization takes

1027
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:55,840
hold we can finally get away from some

1028
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,570
of this [ __ ] but it's it's always a

1029
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,860
struggle it's always a struggle this

1030
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,350
vape things really gonna [ __ ]

1031
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,099
everybody's gonna take three steps back

1032
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,650
hopefully there are some people that

1033
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:07,679
will not there are a lot of people

1034
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,869
pushing hard that have just been

1035
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,690
salivating for their next opportunity

1036
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:16,000
the the people who are just livid that

1037
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,769
we can't arrest anybody who's a minority

1038
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,050
for smelling like weed right now our

1039
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:21,789
[ __ ] thrilled that wants this

1040
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,800
flavored vape thing past they could be

1041
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:26,019
like I [ __ ] smelled cupcakes from the

1042
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,090
sidewalk so we kicked the door in and

1043
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:31,630
arrested everybody yeah that's a little

1044
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:34,210
wacky like we just need to I don't I

1045
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,470
don't know the solution but just got to

1046
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,940
be careful we have to educate consumers

1047
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:40,209
you can't bust people for doing

1048
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,670
something aunt joy well it's it's

1049
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,650
rethinking a lot of stuff is how we fix

1050
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,630
that like everything about arresting

1051
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,869
people for consuming substances that

1052
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,000
makes them happiest

1053
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,960
just [ __ ] if it's not how cops were

1054
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,090
designed to work

1055
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,400
cops protect you for me they can't

1056
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,380
protect you from you absolutely I agree

1057
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,289
with that I just passed Mike a greendot

1058
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,220
labs bait pen I'm not sure what the

1059
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:02,199
flavour is of that but it'll be

1060
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:05,480
delicious

1061
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,189
so I do preach that we don't need to pay

1062
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,679
attention to the numbers on the lab

1063
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,420
tests because your nose nose your nose

1064
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,039
knows what turps and flavors you like

1065
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,440
and how you're gonna get affected by

1066
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,630
that properly your nose knows which

1067
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
product to buy what I do like about the

1068
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,690
lab tests is that assures me that that

1069
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,850
product has been through a lab it has

1070
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,130
been produced in a quality facility

1071
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:27,170
hopefully by an educated grower somebody

1072
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,309
that cares and knows but most of all

1073
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,960
it's been tested I know it has been

1074
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,570
through the market hopefully it's not

1075
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,250
super contaminated if it's in a vape pen

1076
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,750
you know that you're getting probably a

1077
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,980
quality product if it came from the

1078
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,019
dispensary on the black come in there

1079
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,340
and of course dude there are going to be

1080
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,969
bad products that come from the

1081
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,180
dispensary there's honestly right now

1082
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:49,279
because we're still operating in a

1083
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:52,190
federal gray area and we don't have

1084
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,900
access to the resources that every other

1085
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,300
industry has like jewel knows for a

1086
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,570
[ __ ] fact that their heating element

1087
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:03,590
isn't causing the vaping crisis Oh pen

1088
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:05,840
is pretty sure I doubt the people at

1089
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,480
Green Dot have had that tested that's

1090
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,530
just straight up my guess I could be

1091
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,740
wrong but that's my girl the smaller the

1092
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:20,300
company is the lower the odds are that

1093
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:24,889
they have access to the the resources to

1094
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,690
run the testing to be sure now that

1095
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:28,190
doesn't mean that that shit's all that

1096
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,619
much safer than anything else is just

1097
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,480
means they've run more are we gonna get

1098
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,789
sued because of this type testing before

1099
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,090
[ __ ] hits the market

1100
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:43,369
I've watched vape pens evolve since they

1101
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:44,000
first hit the market here and there

1102
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,969
exist

1103
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,340
now makes me more comfortable than their

1104
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:50,839
previous iterations right

1105
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,150
I knew they were putting the crap in him

1106
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,309
before the first couple did like the

1107
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,440
original vaporizers the table tops the

1108
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:59,929
volcanoes those have been around since

1109
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,480
the late 90s if they were making people

1110
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:03,710
sick we'd [ __ ] know it

1111
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,199
some of the medical studies have been

1112
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,690
done on volcano vaporizers with people

1113
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,399
sitting in hospital rooms vaping

1114
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,619
specific amounts of product through

1115
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,809
volcanoes like we would be [ __ ] sure

1116
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,320
if the act of heating cannabis to the

1117
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:21,909
vaporization point cause lung problems

1118
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:26,480
but as soon as we went to the car it's

1119
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:28,429
battery started exploding what's going

1120
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,699
into the car was a big question

1121
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:34,368
carts melting and leaking everywhere the

1122
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,779
guy enough to cook what's in them we

1123
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:38,539
used to work with a good friend who

1124
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,920
smoked the called it the robot dick it

1125
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,000
was just a nicotine vape I'll turn you

1126
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,358
down a little bit go ahead and choke to

1127
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,739
that I would watch him and I'm not

1128
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,429
against your vape if that's what you

1129
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:51,439
want to do vape away bra or lady bra he

1130
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:54,108
would get his vaping and he had this

1131
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Lake looked like a piece of [ __ ] a

1132
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:58,309
cut-up sock and he would just pour this

1133
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,649
liquid [ __ ] syrupy [ __ ] into there

1134
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,880
and then close it up and he would push

1135
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,559
the battery on it he would [ __ ]

1136
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,849
Sparkle and crackle and fireworks have

1137
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:06,739
come out of it and he'd go just right

1138
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:08,930
bro and he would hit it and he would

1139
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,639
take these big old cloudy rips out of it

1140
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:13,279
and he'd make this face like it was

1141
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,049
heaven and he would blow out I hate it

1142
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,290
how good it smelled bro I hate it smell

1143
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:20,570
like megatons a hell of a drug but it

1144
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:23,420
also smelled like cupcakes and [ __ ]

1145
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:26,420
cotton candy and [ __ ] heavy I was

1146
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,369
like God how did you just smoke that but

1147
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,440
it worried I was thinking like bro

1148
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:33,380
you're pouring like some liquid juice

1149
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,740
from China that just says like fizzy

1150
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,059
cupcake juice how do we know what's in

1151
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,009
there and then he would just rip it and

1152
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:42,409
it would smell so strong and I'm like

1153
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:45,080
how many chemicals did it take to smell

1154
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:47,358
right if it smells over here five

1155
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:49,069
minutes later what went through that

1156
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,108
lung the bottle said strawberry

1157
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,269
cheesecake and when he hit it I went

1158
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:55,039
runs that strawberry cheesecake and he

1159
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:56,449
goes exactly I'm like what kind of

1160
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,679
chemicals are in there like what kind of

1161
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:00,619
science [ __ ] like your

1162
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,719
diaphragm it was the it was toast with

1163
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,339
butter and jam was the one that was I

1164
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,099
was like dude it's got multiple flavors

1165
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,250
there's no the [ __ ] is in all that yes

1166
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:12,349
yep but I don't think it's that [ __ ]

1167
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,030
that's making people say it's something

1168
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,460
that it looks like it's specifically

1169
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:20,000
something they're using I agree to cut

1170
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:24,500
down on cannabis oil because in its pure

1171
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,420
form like if you get 90% 95% pure THC

1172
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,909
oil that's just like cold honey it just

1173
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,680
doesn't doesn't work improvement some of

1174
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:35,569
those work done this some of the damage

1175
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,039
in the harm and the problems the

1176
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,050
hospitalizations were caused by a

1177
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,659
vitamin E cut they think that they're

1178
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:43,970
still not sure there's because this is

1179
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,469
all one of the first things they

1180
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:48,489
realized was the people that are getting

1181
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:52,969
sick aren't buying regulated [ __ ]

1182
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:54,409
because if it was like I say Jule cuz

1183
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,869
they're the most popular one but if it

1184
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:58,789
was like Jules blackberry flavor like

1185
00:44:56,869 --> 00:45:00,500
that would have come to light a long

1186
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:02,809
[ __ ] time ago just like it does with

1187
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,460
the cantaloupe you never see a food

1188
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,409
outbreak with hundreds and hundreds and

1189
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:10,220
hundreds of sick people even though

1190
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:12,409
they're recalling tons of food like

1191
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:15,169
you'll see a million pounds of hamburger

1192
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:19,129
got recalled one guy got sick three guys

1193
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:21,260
got sick they got a recall 200 million

1194
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,180
pounds of [ __ ] cantaloupe like

1195
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,620
cantaloupe from an entire region because

1196
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:29,869
the factory they went through it failed

1197
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:31,460
the test if well we were what was

1198
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:33,049
causing these products was coming from

1199
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,130
the legal market it would have been

1200
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,840
traced back already

1201
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,210
right and so it's something that people

1202
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,890
are buying online to cut in their garage

1203
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,380
before they sell black-market cars

1204
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:43,400
that's [ __ ] cheap and nasty and I'm

1205
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,680
glad we don't have to deal with that

1206
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,780
[ __ ] yeah I wouldn't even if I didn't

1207
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,489
have these pins there's one other brand

1208
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,720
I would probably trust but if I didn't

1209
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:52,099
have these I wouldn't even be smoking

1210
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,469
them dude and I mainly bought these for

1211
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,299
a concert so yep and big shout-out to

1212
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:58,759
the concerts were just not even giving a

1213
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,990
[ __ ] I set multiple vape pins in that

1214
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,520
little basket you gotta walk through a

1215
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,719
metal detector and they give you a

1216
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,030
little basket like you're going on a

1217
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,739
plane and you put your your wallet and

1218
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,850
your keys and your phone in some basket

1219
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:09,500
to set him right in there the guys look

1220
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,480
to make three of them ah yeah it's gonna

1221
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,019
be a long night he's like

1222
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,150
okay [ __ ] one of the things that always

1223
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:17,949
makes me laugh when I see people ranting

1224
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,980
and raving about how marijuana causes

1225
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:22,509
violence it's like well security guards

1226
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,599
in the cops if I can be aware by now

1227
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:27,610
like yeah when they see a bunch of

1228
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,679
joints or of a pen they just kind of non

1229
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,990
smile I'm a big dude you're a big dude

1230
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,489
we both tell each other stories of when

1231
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,709
I used to drink like some of our

1232
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:38,229
favorite stories to tell the reason I

1233
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,670
don't drink and I'm I have shame in this

1234
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,070
but I'm an adult now so I could talk

1235
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,320
about it I like to [ __ ] beat people

1236
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,300
up when I drink I don't know why there's

1237
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,690
something about alcohol that I can drink

1238
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,250
a few beers but then there's one and I

1239
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,809
don't know if it's gonna be the seventh

1240
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,820
or the thirty-first of beer but one of

1241
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,369
them I'll take a drink of it and I'll

1242
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,960
just decide let's go fight somebody I

1243
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,489
don't know who I don't know why but

1244
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,349
something in my brain decides you're

1245
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:06,009
definitely not alone punching stuff yeah

1246
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:07,929
yeah no alcohol for me I do I'm six five

1247
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:12,790
and 200 pounds and you're [ __ ] six

1248
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:14,619
four and a lot of pounds really hurts um

1249
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,300
yeah yeah and us together drinking and

1250
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,289
causing problems would be [ __ ] chaos

1251
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,519
I'm not trying to say I'm tough or

1252
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:19,929
anything I'm just I know that I could

1253
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:21,969
cause a problem for myself and others

1254
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:24,369
with alcohol in my life when I smoke

1255
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,659
cannabis I produce a quality podcast the

1256
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,849
teaches others how to improve their

1257
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:29,409
lives better than cannabis and [ __ ]

1258
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:31,480
my friends all like me I don't wake up

1259
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:34,210
in the morning wondering Oh where's my

1260
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,800
car how did I get home where's my wallet

1261
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,329
how much money is left in my wallet

1262
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,950
right I don't have to go through my

1263
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:40,779
phone and see what kind of stupid-ass

1264
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:41,319
text messages I sent to anybody last

1265
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,540
night

1266
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,370
yes woken up the next morning and

1267
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:47,199
discovered I spent all the money for the

1268
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,119
rest of the week on weed yeah like I

1269
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,699
knew that the day I bought the weed

1270
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,589
going into the the transaction it wasn't

1271
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:54,939
something that surprised the [ __ ] out of

1272
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,100
me the next morning when I was trying to

1273
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,380
buy breakfast I like waking up from the

1274
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:01,750
bar the next morning on where the [ __ ]

1275
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:06,369
is my everything

1276
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:07,630
oh she's yeah I really know I didn't I

1277
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:08,920
didn't like that feeling at all it's

1278
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,860
just kind of being a smartass they're

1279
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,500
like I've never seen a security guard

1280
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,000
freak out over Erb like unless they came

1281
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,519
up to you were like quit smoking it in

1282
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,719
here like two or three times in a row

1283
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:23,440
like during one set there's a B there

1284
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,838
were some kids

1285
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,730
Red Rocks one year some younger security

1286
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,139
guards that were younger than me it told

1287
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,059
me you gotta put your weed out and I was

1288

the way both of them two different

1317
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:29,588
things it's the same cause it's like

1318
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,140

and the vape pens are not related those

1322
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:39,670
are two separate stories that we may

1323
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:40,990
have blended together here at the end of

1324
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:44,230
the high part of the talk and they have

1325

1339
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,460
of growing cannabis come from that's so

1340
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:15,880
boring if there's a couple people doing

1341
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,619
it I'm sure

1342
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,910
yeah I want to have a conversation with

1343
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,920
you sometimes I've missed some things

1344
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:21,578
sometimes I talk way too long on other

1345
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,250
things

1346
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:25,778

things a lot of people said I got great

1349
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,829
[ __ ] the main thing people wanted me to

1350
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:35,200
make sure that I mentioned was that it

1351
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:37,120
is all black market [ __ ] and they don't

1352
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,039
think that any of it is

1353
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,019
Pam or ejuice it's all black market

1354
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,820
concentrate pins is what most of the

1355
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:44,829
information that I got back was they

1356
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,630
wanted me to make sure to stand up for

1357
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:48,069
the nicotine side of it is what I think

1358
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,079
most people are saying well I got a lot

1359

podcast is getting huge our listens on

1365
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:05,829
YouTube or multiplying if social media

1366
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:07,779
it's nicer to us cannabis folks we could

1367
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:11,619
really blow it up a little more social

1368
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:13,300
media zeal evil I've got mixed feelings

1369
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,500
on that see a lot of people think we

1370
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,570
should be able to post whatever we want

1371
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,429
I understand that social media platforms

1372
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,930
are owned by other people who have a lot

1373
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:21,039
of [ __ ] lawyers and they can say oh

1374
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:22,899
you like the rules here

1375
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,340
don't play here like it's that simple

1376
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,099
like if I went to the UFC

1377
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:29,079
and I was like hey I'm pretty and skinny

1378
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:30,849
so no punches to the face for this fight

1379
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,139
do you know why we look at me and punch

1380
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:34,989
me straight in the face and go bruh

1381
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:36,159
that's the UFC smack oh yeah I don't get

1382
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:38,289
to make the rules here that's how it is

1383
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,489
that's how social media platforms are

1384
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:40,659
you signed a little thing you don't sign

1385
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,189
it you clicked a little thing when you

1386
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:44,440
signed up they said I won't post dumb

1387
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,820
[ __ ] and they get to decide what dumb

1388
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,409
[ __ ] is and if they decide that your

1389
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,580
picture of your puppy is dumb [ __ ] or

1390
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:50,019
your picture your weed is dumb [ __ ]

1391
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:50,440
that's up to them you can't do [ __ ]

1392
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:53,230
about it

1393
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,970
so I understand that aspect also I come

1394
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,500
from the black market we spoke of

1395
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:58,059

1397
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:01,179

1420
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:48,009
direction just don't assume when social

1421
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:50,170
media is the same as news oh thank you

1422
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,410
Mike if social media is not news there

1423
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,230
is

1424
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:54,460
and I say social media is evil it's not

1425
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,869
because it won't let you post weed

1426
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,710
photos it's because it's making society

1427
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:01,029
[ __ ] dumber it is it's uh it's making

1428
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,070
us that our world we're not supposed to

1429
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,620
[ __ ] say it is retarding us from

1430
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:08,080
actually learning the truth because we

1431
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:10,929
are so distracted by memes and just

1432
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,420
[ __ ] x' headlines that we don't read

1433
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:16,949
any articles anymore or when we little

1434
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:22,440
there was a bright clear line between

1435
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:27,299
news and opinion like the news is

1436
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:31,240
Yankees for Red Sox six the opinion is

1437
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,620
Yankees suck Red Sox suck and both that

1438
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:36,519
those are fun and interesting and

1439
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:41,650
important and both have a place but when

1440
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:44,800
you confuse a for B and B for a bad [ __ ]

1441
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:48,430
happens really bad [ __ ] even when we're

1442
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,019
just talking baseball in like we brought

1443
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:52,449
[ __ ] smallpox in the plague back

1444
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,860
people we're like five years from

1445
