I'm going to I shared a lot of my

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,240
personal life on this show I've talked

33
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,239
about my use of uh medicated personal

34
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,679
lubricants I've talked about what CBD

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,759
does to me um have you guys ever noticed

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,479
that you can take a dab or even flowers

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,280
do it but dabs have definitely made it

38
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,798
happen more uh have you ever smoked a

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
certain strain and it made you have to

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,079
poop right

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
away you went silent on me no I just

42
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,118
going to give the question the thought

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,719
that I I would a rational question all

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,560
right uh I have noticed that

45
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:46,919
occasionally uh there will be a certain

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,159
strain that'll come around and I'll take

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,359
a dab and almost every time I dab it I

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,640
will get the urge to poop right

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,519
away there was I had a phenotype of dead

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,519
head OG it was dead head OG number two

51
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,679
was the phenotype every time I smoked it

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,959

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,598
that have been found to really help with

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,799
digestive issues well then it's probably

57
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,439

170
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,959
headline one of the best headlines I've

171
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,080
gotten to read on the show in a little

172
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,079
while it says the US finally admits

173
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,839
cannabis kills cancer cells that is

174
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,359
great news because now that they're

175
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,959
admitting it maybe we can start uh

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
decriminalizing it and using it as

177
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,399
medicine all over the country oh don't

178
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,318
jump to usion keep reading these are

179
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,079
hopes and dreams I know a man can dream

180
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,400
can't he they really are I sent you this

181
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,079
and this was uh one of the highlights in

182
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,038
my week was reading this story I

183
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,800
actually I caught the journal article

184
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,959
that it talks about a few months back

185
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,400
but I'm glad to see it start to make the

186
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,758
Press guys that sound is parchment paper

187
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,038
how large a dab would you like sir um

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,400
can you eyeball out of three if I told

189
00:06:54,038 --> 00:07:00,038
you a three NOP but I just saw why they

190
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,000
calls it shetta yes the tip that

191
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,639
yeah the tip of the Dabber will chip the

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,160
shatter in your eye that's a good dab

193
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,240
that's I'd probably say that's like 02

194
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,840
nice try that's good enough for me

195
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,199
appreciate piece that came off nice and

196
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,478
smoothly gorgeous all right so I should

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,280
probably read the news article I've

198
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,918
teased you guys about so it says a group

199
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,799
of federal researchers commissioned by

200
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,279
the government to prove that cannabis

201
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,240
has no actical accepted medical use may

202
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,439
have unwittingly let information slip

203
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,639
through the cracks revealing how

204
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,319
cannabis actually kills cancerous

205
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,360
cells see this is the beautiful thing

206
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,360
about about kind of how we got here um

207
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,319
just to step back for a second uh and do

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
my obnoxious thing that's great cuz I

209
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,360
want to dab I saw you w it so I grabbed

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,478
the mic

211
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,598
um cannabis Fanatics and supporters and

212
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:54,240
Advocates don't get to do federal

213
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:56,360
research studies um researchers do and

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,680
the feds have blocked most research not

215
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,919
looking for harm so all the studies we

216
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,240
have showing how safe cannabis is and

217
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,000
what an effective medicine it is most of

218
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,079
those studies are studies that were like

219
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,279
find out that it proves that it causes

220
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,000
lung cancer that's your job find that

221
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,158
link and then one of the top

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,680
researchers spends a couple of years

223
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,079
looking at cannabis use and lung

224
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,199
function and finds out that it doesn't

225
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,279
cause cancer that it increases lung

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
function it's just one of those fun

227
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,839
things about cannabis and this is

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
another great example all right I'm I'm

229
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,638
recovered from my dab nice fill in thank

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
you was perfect all right it says it

231
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,120
says the research which was conducted by

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,080
a team of scientists at St George's

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,639
University of London found that the two

234
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,278
most common canabo in marijuana Tetra

235
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,679
hydr canabal which is THC and canabidol

236
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,360
which is our favorite CBD weakened the

237
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,319
ferocity of cancer cells and made them

238
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,440
more susceptible to radiation treatment

239
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,040
said Mike Adams of herbal

240
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,399
dispatch

241
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,360
so the main two cannabinoids in

242
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,519
marijuana they say marijuana a lot in

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,959
this article in cannabis weaken the

244
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,480
ferocity of cancer cells and make them

245
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,399
more susceptible to radiation treatment

246
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,639
so cannabis is kicking Cancer's ass is

247
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,399
what it's saying right there right

248
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:13,759
making it more that's exactly what it's

249
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,720
saying making it it's [ __ ] and this is

250
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,278
not the first research study to find

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,720
exactly that that something in the

252
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:26,240
marijuana plant likely THC or CBD is

253
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,399
triggering what they call apoptosis and

254
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,759
that's when your cell in your a cell in

255
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
your body is supposed to die it

256
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,759
apoptosis happens and the cell dies it's

257
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,560
replaced by a new cell everything's

258
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,000
great cancer the cell doesn't die and

259
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,119
grows out of control cannabis triggers

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
the cell tells it it's time to Die the

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
second Federal Medical Marijuana patient

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,440
ever has been shouting this from the

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,000
rooftops for years is that uh Irv that's

264
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,519
Irv shout out to Irv Irv and Rosenfeld

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,399
everybody if you haven't heard that name

266
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,839
before Google it Google it read his book

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,958
I recommend it his story will blow your

268
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,640
[ __ ] mind there you go read more

269

at a special room in Disneyland

271
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,278
people he took the US federal government

272
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,399
to court and said cannabis is the best

273
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,519
medicine for me [ __ ] you tell me

274

kept him alive he'd be dead without it

286
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,679
um he's the world record holder for most

287
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,240
joints smoked in a lifetime like sorry

288
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,759
Snoop but Irv's records confirmed he

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,000
gets the gold yeah that's true uh

290
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:59,360
snoop's probably smoked the most Blunts

291
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,480
and also post the most Instagram posts

292
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
that's an award Snoop can win for sure

293
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,639
all right I'm going to read more of this

294
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,159
article it says the study which was

295
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,759
published last year in the medical

296
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,639
journal uh molecular cancer cancer

297
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,600
therapies details the dramatic

298
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,399
reductions in fatal variations of brain

299
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,000
cancer when these specific cannaboids

300
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,720
were used in conjunction with radiation

301
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,839
therapy uh so they didn't try it without

302
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,320
radiation but it said it helped with

303
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,680
radiation in conjunction so marijuana

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
can kill certain cancer cells we've

305
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,759
shown that cannabinoids could play a

306
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,000
role in treating one of the most

307
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,000
aggressive cancers in adults wrote uh

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
lead researcher Dr we Lee I hope I said

309
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,679
that right I apologize uh in a November

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,958
2014 oped for the Washington Post the

311
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,958
results are promising it could provide a

312
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,679
way of breaking through Goma tumors and

313
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,239
saving more lives and then here's a

314
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,799
little sub headline it says recent

315
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,480
animal Studies have shown that marijuana

316
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,278
can kill certain cancer cells and reduce

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,320
the size of others uh the ndaa report

318
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,439
said evidence from one animal study

319
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,959
suggests that extracts from Whole plant

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,000
marijuana can shrink one of the most

321
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,278
serious types of brain tumors research

322
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,600
in mice showed that these extracts when

323
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,958
used with radiation increased the cancer

324
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,079
killing effects of the

325
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:16,439
radiation uh then it goes on to say uh

326
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,439
nda's new found proot position is

327
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,079
especially curious given that it was

328
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,040
revealed on the heels of a recent

329
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,359
proposal introduced to both Congress and

330
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,278
the House of Representative which

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
attempts to legalize medical marijuana

332
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,879
on a national level the bill which is

333
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,198
called the career act the carers ACT I'm

334
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,600
sorry uh seeks to downgrade the schedule

335
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,359
one status of marijuana to a schedule 2

336
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
in order to make the herb more flexible

337
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
in the eyes of the federal government as

338
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,399
an acceptable form of medicine in

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,839
addition the bill would also remove

340
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,759
canabidol the non- intoxicating uh

341
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,639
compound of the pot plant somebody

342
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,559
finally said compound and didn't call it

343
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,240
a [ __ ] ingredient I'm proud of these

344
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,679
people that's awesome it's nice to see

345
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,440
somebody finally get yes I wonder if

346
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,359
they heard the podcast somebody heard me

347
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,560
call them out uh cuz I used the word

348
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,519
compound I was like they say compound uh

349
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,638
anyway uh they are uh removing canabidol

350
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,480
the non- intoxicating compound of the

351
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,879
pot plant from the Controlled Substances

352
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,399
Act to allow it to be distributed on a

353
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,720
state-to-state basis without violating

354
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,480
Federal statutes cannabis became a

355
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
schedule One Drug in 1970 with the

356
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,360
passing of the Controlled Substances Act

357
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,039
which classified cannabis as having a

358
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,600
high potential for abuse no medical

359
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:27,159
usage and unsafe to use without medical

360
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,519
supervision this Federal research

361
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,039
basically conducts cannabis uh

362
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,440
contradicts cannabis's schedule one

363
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,679
status could this mean reform is closer

364
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,000
than we'd originally imagined so yeah is

365
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,638
is this The Floodgate right here for

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,919
cannabis reform now that we have found

367
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,120
out that it actually does kill

368
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:50,958
cancer no and and I say that with with

369
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,519
absolutely no doubt because we've had

370
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,559
the federal government holds a patent of

371
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,519
for cannabis is a neuroprotect in that's

372
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:01,039
kind of where for years um the Federal

373
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,240
Medical Marana programs as old as we or

374
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,639
as old as I am um it's 32 33 years old

375
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,799
now and they've known a lot of this for

376
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,600
decades they don't care they just don't

377
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,159
want to admit it and now if they do

378
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,879
admit it do you think that that's going

379
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,719
to open the pharmaceutical company

380
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,519
floodgates to where they want to make

381
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,000
and patent cannabis products and it's I

382
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:26,000
think as soon as it tips federally legal

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,240
the Pharma industry the tobacco industry

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,198
um everybody's going to try to jump in

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,879
it if they can or if they're you know if

386
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,000
they have a desire to a lot of people

387
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,600
won't there's still that big it's it's

388
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,919
immoral right but I don't think any of

389
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,159
the if you put big and then capitalize

390
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,679
the name of the industry I don't think

391
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,039
they're going to Care yeah the tobacco

392
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,000
industry is not moral they they're

393
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,958
killing you anyway so if they've got one

394
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
more product they can sell you because

395
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,799
it's they're not going to lose cigarette

396
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,079
smokers what do you want to do right

397
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,599
after we get stoned the first thing you

398
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,439
want to do is [ __ ] smoke a cigarette

399
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,519
so now they'll have two products to sell

400
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,880
you and you're going to be buying them

401
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,679
all day long

402
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,399
uh you don't think that uh who is it

403
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,719
Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are those

404
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,839
cigarette companies the two rings a bell

405
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
in my head they are no you got you pull

406
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,800
two name correct name those guys the

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,000
Alpha Brain dude we're going to

408
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,958
attribute that to Alpha Brain do you

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,839
think attribute that [ __ ] to advertising

410
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,679
[ __ ] do you think those guys are

411
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,160
lined up they're like [ __ ] yes and no

412
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,559
the football team at the scrimmage line

413
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,600
ready to run as soon as someone says

414
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,359
hike they're going to go um there's

415
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,800
definite evidence that different tobacco

416
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,919
companies are definitely looking into

417
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,159
marijuana legalization have been since

418
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,519
the 70s cuz we got really close in the

419
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,559
70s nobody seems to remember this but

420
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,720
Jimmy car Carter almost was the

421
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,479
president Who legalized it almost I

422
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
wasn't there for that I showed up late I

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,639
wasn't there for that either but it's

424
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,278
part of the history um but uh yeah where

425
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
the [ __ ] were we I just dabbed out for a

426
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:51,318
minute oh man I saw you look at your

427
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,318
hand you looked at your fingernails like

428
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,198
I'm not sure what I'm saying right now

429
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,559
yep all right so now they have found out

430
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,198
that that cannabis will kill cancer

431
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,958
cells and we're worried that it's going

432
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,399
to go to the pharmaceutical companies

433
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,559
big tobacco's going to jump in it goes

434
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,000
the tobacco companies has been looking

435
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,359
at it into the 70s that's where the [ __ ]

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,559
I was going there you go um but never

437
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,240
seriously there's some serious problems

438
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,518
with like a lot of people just assume oh

439
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,198
well all marro has to do is plant huge

440
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,519
fields of Sour Diesel and then they can

441
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,159
put out cartons and maros just like no a

442
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,839
it doesn't grow like tobacco B it

443
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,759
doesn't dry like tobacco C it doesn't

444
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,360
cure like tobacco D it doesn't roll

445
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,440
through the same machines as tobacco

446
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,120
like they would l literally have to

447
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,480
build the whole infrastructure up from

448
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,560
scratch they can't just convert their

449
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,120
existing right so there's that hurdle

450
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,359
for everybody on top of which Colorado

451
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,519
Dixie Elixir is

452
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,959
already I mean they're already done

453
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,318
they're already set up all that

454
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,679
infrastructure is already built wow so

455
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:54,159
at this point marbro has to catch up to

456
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,239
Dixie like that's just the reality there

457
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,278
are some Pharma companies in Great

458
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
Britain that are light years ahead of

459
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,958
the rest of the industry but that's

460
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,198
because Great Britain has much better

461
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,318
research rules than we do so back in the

462
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,199
day uh I used to see on like Facebook

463
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,159
and [ __ ] used to see pictures of marel

464
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
having weed packages already made was

465
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,079
that real do you think or is that was

466
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
just some stuff it's just a it's just a

467
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,918
Photoshop mockup there was a company out

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,240
of Colorado that was attempting to put

469
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,280
together a pack of cigarettes filled

470
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,199
with

471
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,279
cannabis um I believe they were to the

472
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,919
marketing to dispensary stage the last

473
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,319
time I heard about them I don't know if

474
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,720
they're if they were to go funme stage

475
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,960
and the guy was over pitching it at the

476
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
restaurant or what but I've heard

477
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,720
they're on the market I don't go to

478
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,240
shops enough to know right yeah I don't

479
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,480
I guess I do go to a shop often because

480
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I work in one but I don't pay attention

481
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,640

has a weed friendly balcony so here's my

549
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,120
issue with the balcony so you're a

550
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,240

552
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,159
balcony and give you crazy good weed at

553

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,559
for a GU how many different ways can we

555
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
set ourselves up for failure in this

556
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,639
industry we like we can't Bank we're

557
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,120
incredibly popular so we're essentially

558
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,280
giant buildings full of weed and money

559
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,199
like what Jackass with a big gun and a

560

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,000
need for consumption clubs and cannabis

609

610
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,038

article and just kind of rant on that

612
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,000
that's where I was headed with this um

613
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,480
so we can have a and I'm not trying to

bash on the hotel here I sound like I'm

615

they couldn't smoke in there anymore or

629
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,640
they would be uh dealt with uh the

630
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,399
Grassroots break room got shut down so

631

653
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
tours uh tour operators to book Vape

Denver's first outwardly friendly hotel

656
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,199
the charm of native hotel is that the

657
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,120
owners are in the business said Meyer

658
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,360

659
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,918
a number of cannabis related Ventures we

660
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,439

the hotel for the day you know you got

670

there' just be a spot to go chill and

672
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,799

you're doing all right they have a

674
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:45,558

Ballroom all right bad roster we embrace

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,640
situations like hangover

692
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,799
drinks yeah that's that hemp juice they

693
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,320
selling on the net oh since it's c TBD

694
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,278
they can sell it right since it's not

695
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,200
THC it qualifies as hemp is that how

696
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,558
they're getting away with it yeah you're

697
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,360
allowed to grow hemp in most

698
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,639
industrialized nations and they've been

699
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,199
squeezing CBD out of it since it hit

700
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,759
sanj Gupta because I was going to

704
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,159

705
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,398
dude by it's not really medicated it's

706

standard high-end Boutique Hotel he said

720
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:32,839
entrepreneurs that have sprung up just

721
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,639
outside to help support our wonderful

722
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,319
industry he uh had money that's what he

723
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,799
showed up with and a reason to protect

724
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,519
that [ __ ] Uncle Sam won't take your take

725
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,440
your [ __ ] for working with us it will

726

take it if you are us that's the truth

727
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,600
wow that's a good thing to think about

728
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,719
yep they don't want your tax money like

729
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:54,879
that I have people in my life that have

730
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,240
lobed me to be him rather than to be me

731
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,720
extensively for that reason yeah uh

732
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,599
pretty soon Mike is going to teach you

733
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,720
guys how to become a lobbyist or how to

734
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,359
get in the ground floor of doing medical

735
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,759
marijuana activism or recreational

736
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,278
Cannabis activism or cannabis

739
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,440
little lesson on how to get into that

740
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,720
pretty soon for us here probably two or

741
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,679
three episodes away from that to tell

742
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,960
you the truth it's time to get involved

743
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,798
people I'm going to tell you how it's

744
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,240
done yeah it's not that much you guys

745
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,240
seem intimidated but it's not that bad

746
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,919
it's really not that bad this guy's got

747
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,880
this hotel and you can smoke there and

748
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,520
it goes on to say we're not going to be

749
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,320
hanging green crosses everywhere added

750
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,599
Meer who said he funded native with

751
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,798
money he made in the financial industry

752
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,439
uh we know that there's this big

753
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,359
cannabis tourism movement and we want to

754
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
be able to embrace it we have cannabis

755
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,240
friendly friendly rooms because they

756
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,119
have balconies

757
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,359
16 what uh just out of curiosity do you

758
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,639
remember the the the number of people

759
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,038
that came in for the Cannabis Cup um a

760
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,640
lot more than

761
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:58,278
16 right all right so when this thing

762
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,880
works we need about 3,500 other people

763
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:05,440
to do the same thing yes yes in

764
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,840
looto no all over Colorado true but I

765
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,519
mean just for the Cannabis Cup like come

766
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,519
on we need one in West right away we

767
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,159
need a we need a cannabis Marriott

768
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,000
there's a hotel in Manitou Springs that

769
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,840
claims to be 420 friendly they have a

770
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,038
420 friendly on the sign but this is the

771
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,798
first one in Denver is the only reason

772
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,359
it's really special the one in manat 2

773
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:27,038
it's not you can't smoke in the room

774
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,479
they have a smoking tent and then they

775
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,879
have a sub smok smoking ttin like they

776
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,079
have the cigarette ttin and then right

777
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,919
next to it is the Cannabis ttin with

778
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,038
like chairs and [ __ ] in there so it is

779
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,600
420 friendly in there but you can't

780
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,319
smoke out and dab out in the room and

781
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,439
what's the point I want to lay in the

782
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,480
bed and watch cartoons right I've smoked

783
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,480
weed in plenty of Hotel parking lots why

784
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,079
is this one special all right so Meer

785
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,640
said he's been kicked out of hotels in

786
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,839

787
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,360

crazy amounts and kick you out he said

789
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,519
I've been kicked out at a hotel in

00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,398
Denver for smoking cannabis it was a

791
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,599
mid-tier smaller hotel and it was a few

792
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:03,439
years back but that's the kind of uh

793
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,240

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,840
and triple check everything so we're not

812
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:46,158
putting our business at risk Meer said

813
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,240
it's a hotel a club and a restaurant and

814
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,360
we have a lot of alcohol rated Point of

815
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,440
Sales so we're keeping the Cannabis to

816
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,199
the rooms yeah that's a big thing to

817
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,399
think about they're going to have to

818
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,120
keep the Cannabis and the alcohol

819
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,839
separate because the alcohol they're not

820
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,918
allowed to let you gather

821
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,879
it's a really bizarre part of the law

822
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,200
right now most places don't allow any

823
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,200
sort of gathering to consume cannabis

824
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,640
they get all kinds of touchy it has to

825
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,600
be private invite

826
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,159
only um private property close to the

827
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,199
public secured

828
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,320
security I mean it's just obnoxious all

829
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,759
the [ __ ] the symphony had to go through

830
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,639
just so that people could get baked and

831
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,839
then go listen to the symphony and then

832
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,640
they tried to shut that down tried hard

833
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,199
um they really set the path for the the

834
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,080
the rules for doing this which is kind

835
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,798
of awesome way to go Colorado Symphony

about um getting us into politics yeah

868
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,599
what's getting involved that's what

869
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,519
it'll be called it's not so much getting

870
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,759
you in into politics or getting you into

871
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,679
lobbying it's just you got to get

872
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,158
involved if you don't get involved now

873
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,679
we're going to be stuck in the same

874
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,240
night marish Loop forever people they're

875
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
going to make stupid rules around us

876
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,880
that we didn't even pay attention to

877
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,278
them making and they're going to pass it

878
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,840
CU nobody knew yep yeah and then you're

879
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:57,558
your whole country is going to be stuck

880
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,798
with [ __ ] CBD only medicine because

881
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,359
we weren't paying attention yep yeah we

882
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,480
don't need that to happen one of the big

883
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,278
anti-pot groups uh going around the

884
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,798
country right now is now lobbying for

885
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:10,319
CBD only

886
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,319
nationally uh because if that rule goes

887
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,119
in federally they get to their perfect

888
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,359
excuse for stamping out all of the

889
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,558
medical access we've created since

890
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:23,199
96 they get to say again well the feds

891
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,440
are allowing it nobody else gets to have

892
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,720
it except through a b and c and they get

893
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,278
to shut down everything Coast to Coast

894
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,000
like it's all the excuse they need they

895
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,638
did it once already in the

896
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,960
80s I fear that that sounds terrible

897
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:38,359
we'll talk more about that on a future

898
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,278
on the episode when you tell us what how

899
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,000
to get involved we'll talk about that in

900
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:43,278
