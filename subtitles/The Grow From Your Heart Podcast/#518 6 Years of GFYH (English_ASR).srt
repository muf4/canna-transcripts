00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,939
not be what it is and I see it I

103

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,530
support we recently hit episode 500

105
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,510
which felt like a huge milestone and now

106
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,370
we are at 6 years of podcasting which

107
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:18,339
feels like another huge milestone I

108
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,319
really see no end in sight you guys I am

109
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,659
going to keep podcasting as long as I've

110
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,279
got a voice a microphone and a couple of

111
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,229
good toys to play with and we've got the

112
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,659
Internet I will keep putting out quality

113
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,029
podcasts so thank you

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,750
for the support and look forward to many

115
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,669
more years of continued quality

116
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,160
podcasting I feel like at this point in

117
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,930
time at this state of affairs in this

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,120
weird situation in the world

119
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,639
I feel like content providers and

120
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,500
content creators will be a big part of

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,899
what get us through these strange times

122
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,680
a lot of our entertainment avenues have

123
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,989
been shut down

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,360
we can't go to comedy clubs we can't go

125
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,370
see live music the bars have been closed

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,560
the restaurants have been closed we're

127
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,840
all facing weird times because of this

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,030
coronavirus so I think that people are

129
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,029
going to turn to podcasts and YouTube

130
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:08,939
and other forms of entertainment to keep

131
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:11,519
them sane so I am going to do my best to

132
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,469
keep quality podcasting coming until

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,969
there is a major reason for me to stop

134
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,320
they're gonna have to stop me they're

135
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,880
gonna have to take this microphone away

136
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,189
they're gonna have to take my toys away

137
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,930
I'm gonna do it till the end because I

138
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,490
know that people are relying on me not

139
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,800
just to keep their Gardens up to speed

140
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,019
at this point in time we're relying on

141
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,449
each other just for sanity I'm doing

142
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,120
podcasts to fill the time we were doing

143
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,370
a little self quarantine a little social

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,110
distancing during that time I won't see

145
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,030
a lot of my friends I won't be going out

146
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,740
and about like I normally do so I will

147
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,809
have more opportunity to sit here and

148
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,639
focus on better podcasting and I'm going

149
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,589
to make an effort to do that because I

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,629
know you need that at this time I'm

151
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:51,359
getting a lot of my social interaction

152
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,579
through social media I do Instagram live

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,650
videos I go watch my friends videos I've

154
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,019
been facetiming more we're gonna have to

155
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:00,599
find better ways safer ways different

156
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:03,060
ways alternative ways to communicate to

157
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,700
socialize and get our entertainment and

158
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,620
I really feel like it is time for

159
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,479
podcasters and content providers to step

160
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,090
up and fill that gap we're stuck at home

161
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,430
we might as well produce better content

162
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,509
for you so here we are thank you I'm

163
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,980
gonna keep it going

164
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,990
I feel like I've been really ranting on

165
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,550
a couple of episodes lately but we've

166
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,050
been faced with a lot of weird things

167
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,180
and I've got a lot of weird [ __ ] on my

168
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,650
mind and maybe since I'm not getting out

169
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,150
and seeing my friends and my friends

170
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,859
aren't coming here maybe I'm just extra

171
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,539
talkative when I turn on the mic just

172
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,629
got a lot of [ __ ] to say it feels like

173
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,330
these are crazy times you guys and if

174
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:38,550
you think about it we are a big part of

175
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,529
history if you are here listening to

176
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,560
this podcast you have gotten to see a

177
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,229
lot of

178
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,019
monumental moments in history world

179
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,030
history American history if you're here

180
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,189
listening you are seeing the

181
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,168
legalization of cannabis right now that

182
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,939
is way on the back burner of everybody's

183
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,909
mind for the next couple of weeks but

184
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:00,069
we're in the midst of nationwide

185
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,320
cannabis legalization it started several

186
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,779
years ago in California then it's slowly

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,269
crept through other states then once

188
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,269
California Colorado and Washington all

189
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:12,159
had major cannabis laws in place and it

190
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:14,589
was working that's when [ __ ] started

191
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,250
flowing and now I think we have got more

192
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:20,589
states with positive cannabis laws than

193
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,009
we do states with complete prohibition

194
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:26,168
so you are witnessing the sweep the

195
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,379
shift the transition of cannabis

196
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:32,079
legalization nationwide in America you

197
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,620
are getting to see that also if you are

198
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,668
witnessing and you were part of this

199
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,620
coronavirus you were seeing something

200
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:41,560
that we have never seen before we have

201
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,569
seen many weird tragedies and weird

202
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,490
things and events unfold in the States

203
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,339
and in the world but we've never seen

204
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,439
anything like this so it may seem weird

205
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:52,509
it may seem uncomfortable it may seem

206
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,000
scary it may just seem like a big joke

207
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,849
to you whatever it seems like pay some

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,889
attention because this is a major

209
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,560
historical monumental time we are going

210
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,969
to be talking about this for a hundred

211
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,889
years we're going to be talking about

212
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,289
this to our grandchildren and their

213
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,269
children so pay attention take some

214
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,550
notes just be aware of what's going on

215
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:14,918
around you because this is a crazy time

216
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,288
now I know I keep saying this but in

217
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,599
these crazy times the most important

218
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,788
thing to do is to be good to one another

219
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,680
and look after each other we can't get

220
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:26,079
through these crazy times on our own

221
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,660
some crazy [ __ ] people will get

222
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,668
through on their own but most of us need

223
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,469
each other most of us don't want to get

224
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:34,509
by on our own most of us would rather

225
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,310
put a hand out and help somebody and

226
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,200
have somebody stick their hand out and

227
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,629
help us in return that's the way it

228
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,849
should work so be kind to everybody

229
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:44,620
right now have a little bit of extra

230
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,050
patience with everybody around you and

231
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,149
remember that everybody is dealing with

232
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,250
this weird situation and we are all

233
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,220
going to deal with it in our own weird

234
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,029
way we don't all respond to situations

235
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,399
similarly that should be

236
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:59,199
obvious by social media some people are

237
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,759
completely freaking out some people

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
don't give a [ __ ] and some people are

239
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,419
right there in the middle however you

240
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,789
were choosing to deal with these weird

241
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,559
times with this weird situation keep in

242
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:10,269
mind that we are all dealing with weird

243
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,399
[ __ ] as well we are all uncomfortable

244
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,559
we're all adjusting our lives and

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,329
schedules we've all been cooped up we

246
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,679
all want to make sure we eat we all want

247
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,690
to make sure that our families survive

248
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,849
we all want to stay healthy you're not

249
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,310
the only one let's do our part together

250
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,529
to keep an eye on each other and keep

251
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,959
each other safe and happy and healthy

252
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,149
and let's just be kind to one another in

253
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,250
any and every way that we can you guys

254
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,990
I'm sure that most of my audience most

255
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,100
of my friends most of the irie are me

256
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,049
and the girl from your heart crew

257
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,940
doesn't need to hear that but it's just

258
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:42,519
a simple reminder sometimes in weird

259
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,670
times we forget the basic [ __ ] the most

260
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,799
important basic [ __ ] is to love one

261
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,329
another and be kind to each other and we

262
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,370
will get through this all right you guys

263
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,950
I feel like I'm [ __ ] super ranty and

264
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,169
super preachy but I also feel like if

265
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,480
it's my responsibility to provide

266
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:00,699
content and keep people entertained I've

267
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,710
also got to speak the positive message

268
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,540
so there you go that's the message we

269
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,910
can [ __ ] do this we're gonna be just

270
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,179
fine take care of everybody now let's

271

the show big shout out to our friend

285
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,759
Thor he is back with another question it

286
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:45,399
says I got a few head scratchers I want

287
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,529
to run by you and see what you think it

288
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,019
starts off with my little brother has

289
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,179
ADHD really badly which he takes

290
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,220
adderall for he's been on adderall

291
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,709
pretty much his whole life it makes him

292
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,840
very irritable and a zombie so I'm in

293
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,860
the works of trying to get my mom to try

294
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:05,230
him on CBD my question for you is if I

295
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,029
was to run a CBD plant in the same tent

296
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,310
with my other babies would it hurt

297
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,049
anything

298
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,028
I've been holding onto these CBD seeds

299
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:14,939
for a while now because I'm scared the

300
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:17,639
CBD will affect my THC content on my

301
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,680
other plants that's a very good question

302
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,559
and you were honestly not the first

303
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,969
person to ask that question I'm gonna

304
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,369
kind of clear up the question for other

305
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,370
listeners our friend Thor here has a

306
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,519
garden with normal cannabis plants where

307
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,589
he is growing to achieve high THC

308
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,929
potency he wants that THC buzz and most

309
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,480
of his garden unfortunately he's got a

310
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,370
family member who was on medication that

311
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,370
makes them a zombie and he's trying to

312
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,769
offer CBD as an alternative and he wants

313
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,769
to take it upon himself to grow that CBD

314
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,679
in his grow tent with his THC rich

315
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:55,740
plants and he is concerned that that CBD

316
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:59,009
plant may somehow disrupt or contaminate

317
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,950
his THC garden have no fear my friend

318
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:04,409
because nothing bad will happen to your

319
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,230
THC crop you will be able to grow your

320
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:09,329
THC plants right alongside your CBD

321
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,159
plants and everything will be perfectly

322
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,280
happy nothing will go wrong

323
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,519
you are basically growing a different

324
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,470
phenotype of the same type of plant next

325
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,149
to other plants so if you've got I'm

326
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,399
just gonna make up strains if you've got

327
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,620
a rise and you've got golden goat and

328
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,779
you've got oh gee cush in one room when

329
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,519
you add whichever CBD varietal you're

330
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,409
gonna put in there it's going to think

331
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,299
you just put in another oh gee Kush or

332
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,490
another golden goat or another arise

333
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,229
it's basically just like putting another

334
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,060
cannabis plant in there the main

335
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,060
difference is that that plant has bred

336
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,859
to express different cannabinoids the

337
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,809
plants who are familiar with growing if

338
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,659
I bred them if other breeders bred them

339
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:51,539
we probably bred them to be rich in THC

340
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:53,669
those plants that are rich in CBD are

341
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,860
the same plants just bred for a

342
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,719
different goal they bred they found

343
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,940
plants with CBD in there then they

344
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,560
isolated those and bred to those again

345
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,770
and repeated the process until they

346
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,899
stabilized that CBD dominant trait so it

347
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,759
is the same type of a plant it will grow

348
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,528
similarly they may have different

349
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,639
characteristics it may want slightly

350
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:14,399
different things because it is

351
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:18,059
phenotypically different but it will not

352
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,309
have any adverse effects to your THC

353
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,328
plants a really simple way to think

354
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,979
about this is if you

355
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:24,958
got a farm full of chickens and you put

356
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,239
a turkey on the farm do your chickens

357
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,128
turn into turkeys everybody just stays

358
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,600
exactly what they are your cannabis

359
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,749
plants are going to continue to produce

360
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,058
that THC rich bud your CBD plants will

361
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:37,798
begin to produce that CBD rich bud

362
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:39,808
everything will go just as nature

363
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:42,328
intended and I think you'll be a happy

364
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:45,178
camper and I really hope that the CBD

365
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:47,578
medicine works well for your brother so

366
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:49,619
we can help out with that ADHD and maybe

367
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,328
kind of we can't take away the adderall

368
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,009
right away I'm not a doctor but maybe we

369
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:55,019
can minimize that get a little

370
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,818
personality back into them make them a

371
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,528
fun little brother again hopefully that

372
00:13:56,818 --> 00:14:00,238
works for you all right so that is the

373
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:02,698
first half of the question you can

374
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:05,100
totally put your CBD rich plants in with

375
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:07,198
your THC plants nothing will happen

376
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,209
nothing bad will happen if you grow

377
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,159
properly you will have two marvelous

378
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,198
types of medicine they'll work for your

379
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,419
brother and yourself like I said before

380
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,308
if you put a goose in the chicken pan or

381
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,988
if you put a turkey in the cow pen we

382
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:21,328
don't get different types of animals

383
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:23,610
everybody stays the same to the best of

384
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,258
my knowledge plants will work just the

385
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,318
same you're definitely not going to

386
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,058
disrupt the THC production or the CBD

387
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:32,308
production there is another half to this

388
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:34,379
question I'm super rambling because of

389
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:36,899
that dad let's keep going it says my

390
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,119
other question is about nutrients I'm

391
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,668
currently trying the advanced nutrients

392
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:44,069
three-part grow micro and bloom on the

393
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:47,338
label they advertise that their product

394
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:49,019
is pH perfect I still check my pH when I

395
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,449
water because I'm not sure if it is safe

396
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,178
to trust do you have any experience with

397
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:57,149
advanced nutrients and pH perfect

398
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:59,639
products yes I do have some experience

399
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,369
and some input and some feedback when I

400
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,539
first started taking growing seriously

401
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:06,149
and was really trying to up my

402
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,698
production I was sold by the advanced

403
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,589
nutrients pitch if you will get 30% more

404
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,599
products just by using all of our

405
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:16,049
bottles I really thought that that would

406
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,028
work well for me I did achieve that 30%

407
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,159
that they talked about I noticed that my

408
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:22,048
yields and my harvests were bigger the

409
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,178
thing I did not like about advanced

410
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:26,100
nutrients and this is just my opinion I

411
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:29,159
have no hatred for anybody this was just

412
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,709
my experience I ran multiple different

413
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,688
strains in the same room I had cherry

414
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,250
widow in there I had blueberry in there

415
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:37,409
I had white rhino and

416
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,200
room I had several different varietals

417
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:42,809
in that room and when I grew them using

418
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,660
advanced nutrients bottled nutrients

419
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,849
most of my flowers looked and smelled

420
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,490
the same once they were harvested there

421
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,070
was not a big variation in my products

422
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,570
and I carefully selected my strains I

423
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,120
had that cherry widow because it's

424
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,720
cherry it's got that really funky cherry

425
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
flavor

426
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,500
I had blueberry because it's got a very

427
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,240
distinct blueberry flavor

428
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,190
I had white rhino because it would make

429
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,350
giant buds that were covered and resin

430
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,140
and had this really sweet flavor to it

431
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,700
but in the end of the grow it all looks

432
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,439
like white rhino it all looks like

433
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,450
cherry widow you couldn't tell the buds

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,220
apart if you put them in a bag and I

435
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,920
really blame that I really attribute

436
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,410
that to the advance nutrients product

437
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,269
line I don't know exactly what does it I

438
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:26,219
have my assumptions in my theories I

439
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,990
cannot prove that I'm not going to say

440
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,149
it because I have no science to back it

441
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,850
up but I really think those nutrients

442
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:36,840
made all of my flowers all of my buds

443
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,879
look smell and taste exactly the same so

444
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,160
now let's talk about the pH perfect part

445
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,200
I don't know the science behind it but

446
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,429
if you mix their nutrients in the proper

447
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,980
ratios they will come out pH perfect at

448
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,899
6.5 if 6.5 is your goal that is a

449
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,560
beautiful process that does save you a

450
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,379
step I would however check every time I

451
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,029
mix my nutrients if it is off that may

452
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,610
indicate that you skipped a bottle or

453
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,910
perhaps it doubled up on a bottle but in

454
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:09,900
my experience those solutions did mix up

455
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:12,569
to pH perfect at 6.5 if I used the

456
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,420
appropriate amounts of each product and

457
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:18,059
if I mixed it appropriately so the claim

458
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,539
of pH perfect does hold up in my

459
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:24,029
experience the claim of 30% more product

460
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,549
does hold up in my experience the only

461
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:29,129
downside I noticed from using that line

462
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:32,339
of products was that most of my flowers

463
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,990
looked smelled and tasted exactly the

464
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,119
same so instead of growing multiple

465
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,769
strains I should have just ran a whole

466
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,709
bunch of one strain to make the entire

467
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:42,029
room uniform but nobody wants a whole

468
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,519
bunch of one product you would like

469
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:47,339
variety at least in my circle in my area

470
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,220
people demand variety so that's the way

471
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,740
I had to do it

472
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,048
so the pH did work for me but again I

473
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,750
recommend that you do check your pH

474
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:57,099
every time you mix just to be safe that

475
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,839
can tell you if you messed up in your

476
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,459
mix I can tell you if you over fed

477
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,558
something if you under fed something

478
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,900
also it's a good way to make sure that

479
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,379
that pH pin is working if something is

480
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,000
off

481
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,919
calibrate the pin then check the

482
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,288
solution again then you know if your pin

483
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,850
or your solution is off you guys make

484
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,859
sure you calibrate your equipment I know

485
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,329
I just went on a wayside road we're

486
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,769
gonna get lost on this side street for a

487
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,899
minute come have fun with me

488
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:23,288
it's always fun on the side roads make

489
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,200
it a habit to routinely calibrate your

490
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:29,109

time I spend talking into a microphone

that means a lot to me people are

553

getting better at their craft they're

554
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,450

me thank you that is a huge compliment

559
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,349
you're welcome for all of the

560
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,720
information I feel like I've been given

561
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:07,319
a serious gift I've got a lot of gifts

562
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,930
the gift to absorb information and learn

563
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,970
so quickly and then also to have been in

564
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,070
the place where cannabis was legalized

565
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,410
where I had all these opportunities I

566
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:19,049
know that those two things were major

567
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,720
gifts that lined up then also to have

568
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:24,210
this personality this gift of gab this

569
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,190
uh this inability to shut the [ __ ] up

570
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,380
this constant need to be talking and

571
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,910
teaching and sharing ideas I think that

572
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,040
that is a gift sometimes it's a curse

573
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,840
don't get me wrong but I think I have

574
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,940
harnessed it and turned it into a gift

575
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,159
the gift of being able to learn

576
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,930
something and then also the gift of

577
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,820
being here in Colorado where cannabis

578
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,350
was legalized and then this other gift

579
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,359
of being able to share my ideas

580
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:47,250
articulately I think that that was

581
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,429
something that was given to me that I am

582
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,380
supposed to use in this exact manner if

583
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,539
I didn't do this I think something would

584
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,820
go wrong like I would just explode I may

585
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,799
spontaneously combust nothing in my

586
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,049
world would be right if I didn't share

587
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,149
this information and this knowledge I

588
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:05,250
feel like whatever you believe in if

589
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,200
it's God if it's Jesus if it's the son

590
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,579
if you believe in bacon whatever you

591
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,440
believe in I'm gonna go with yours

592
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,869
because it's much easier whatever you

593
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,789
believe in that diet II that creation

594
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,179
gave me this gift and if I didn't use it

595
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,389
it would all

596
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,980
be disrespectful to bacon or the Sun or

597
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,060
whoever you believe in I'm cool with

598
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,799
whatever you believe in I'm pretty

599
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,389
open-minded you know what I'm down with

600
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,619
but it's much more friendly if I just

601
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,780
let you have yours for a moment so

602
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:30,179
whatever you believe in gave me this

603
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,220
ability and it would be disrespectful

604
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,440
and selfish to bottle it up and not put

605
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,360
that out so thank you for noticing and

606
