52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,439
phases where uh you can smoke a lot and

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
you don't get blazed or some days you

54
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,479
could smoke very little and you get

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,480
blazed all the way uh the past two days

56
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
i could just smoke i was like a smoke i

57
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,799
was like a fog machine it's like my job

58
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,560
and my duty was to see how many grams of

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
concentrates i could put through my rig

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
and through my lungs and i wasn't

61
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,000
getting blazed i don't know why i was

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,598
just getting work done and i couldn't

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,039
[ __ ] stop i was just smoking and

64
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,119
smoking and my brain was like no do more

65
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,799
work keep going you're not high yet so i

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,159
just take more dabs and do more work and

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
i just didn't feel like i got blazed for

68
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,158
like two straight days but today

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
i've been smoking the same concentrates

70
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,878
that i smoked for the past two days and

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
today that first dab of today that [ __ ]

72
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,318
wrecked me that kicked my ass and every

73
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,958
dab after that has been beautiful as

74
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,719
well so uh do you go through phases

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,719
sometimes like i said sometimes i can

76
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,919
smoke all the dabs and i don't get high

77
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,359
but then there's some days when i can

78
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,439
open the jar and look at the dabs and

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
i'm like i'm so high i need munchies

80
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,959
like do you do you do that does your

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
body do that i think mine is attributed

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
to

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
um a lot of his hydration i think if i'm

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,040
dehydrated i'll get super blazed super

85
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,199
quickly and i cough more my lungs burn a

86
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,039
lot of it is diet have i eaten enough if

87
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,119
i've had too much sugar too much junk

88
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,798
then maybe i don't get as blazed also

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,158
sometimes i'm just in the [ __ ] zone

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,159
my brain is like dude you're gonna do

91
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,000
work today and nothing is gonna stop you

92
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,479
and i just i ended up transplanting

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,719
everything cleaning everything my brain

94
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,158
was on fire that day but today anyway i

95
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,158
am going to be high and rambly because

96
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,359
the dabs are working today they are back

97
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,798
in full

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
effect all right let's try to keep my

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,438
high ass in focus on track on some sort

100
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,438
of path here i do have a few notes the

101
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,639

102
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:08,158

store to my instagram page what i

104
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,560

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,959
store if you go to the irie underscore

106

jamaican word it means to uh to feel as

blessed as you could feel is basically

130
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,000
what that means like if you had a reggae

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,000
good i describe it as uh for me irie is

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,839
like uh sitting on like the top of a

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
grassy hill i like that cold feeling of

137
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,959
like when the sun is shining and the

138
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
grass is cool so i'm sitting in the

139
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,638
grass uh maybe got a lady next to me

140

maybe a dog on the other side of me

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,038
maybe multiple dogs um

142
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,279
just uh the the sun is just setting the

143
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,279
breeze is just right the vibe is good

144
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,079
got a fat spliff burning nothing could

145
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,159
go wrong no worries in the in my mind at

146
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,159

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520

289
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,399
two

290
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
the grow help question the problem

291
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,639
that's what it says here uh cloning

292
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
problems i take my clones from healthy

293
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,159
mothers that's always a good start i

294
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
always water the day before cutting

295
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,000
clones and i'm always sterile sounds

296
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
like you're off to a good start you guys

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,879
clean up your cloning area when you're

298
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,799
taking clones

299
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,958
think of it as like uh

300
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,719
if you got your finger cut off you could

301
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,000
bring your finger to me and your hand

302
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
and you could throw them down on this

303
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
table and you could say bro can you

304
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,360
stitch my finger up and i could

305
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
but i've been taking dabs at this table

306
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
i may have eaten thai food at this table

307
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
recently this table may not be the

308
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
cleanest place for me to uh reattach

309
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,759
your finger you may want a more clean

310
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,879
sterile sanitary type environment think

311
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,919
about that when you're cutting clones

312
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,519
you're cutting their arms off you're

313
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,958
cutting their legs off and you're trying

314
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
to make them grow into fresh healthy

315
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,239
parts let's be clean so our friend says

316
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
i always try to be sterile that is a

317
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,919
very good way to start that is a good

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,920
practice to teach so always cut clones

319
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,159
in that clean sterile environment if and

320
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,000
when possible as clean as possible go

321
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,078
and you also use clean uh sterile

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,679
equipment everybody's getting a hop

323
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,599
latent viroid they're passing around

324
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,838
this virus and it can move from plant to

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
plant via your scissors so clean your

326
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,279
scissors all the time right now is

327
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
something we should talk about that's

328
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,278
like [ __ ] plant covid plant aids

329
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
i'll get somebody who's more qualified

330
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,879
to talk about hop layton viroid i'm

331
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
honestly not qualified to talk about

332
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,799
that that's a virus i need a more

333
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,159
qualified uh school educated person for

334
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,599
that if you're smart enough i'm not

335
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,278
smart enough educated enough to come

336
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
talk about that let me know uh we'll get

337
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,320
you on the show somehow i do uh got

338
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
another microphone we're gonna talk

339
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
about that in the future shout out to

340
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
our buddy white mike all right i'm going

341
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,879
to get back on track it says i have an

342
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,800
at least a 95 success rate the problem

343
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,480
is once my clone or my clones always

344
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,039
look like [ __ ] and most of the time they

345
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,879
go into flower and reveg

346
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,199
that right there is a main key that's a

347
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,919
main hint that tells me that they're not

348
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
getting enough light um your light cycle

349
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,399
is not on long enough are they under 24

350
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
hours of light put your light on 24

351
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,440
hours

352
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
maybe get it closer maybe get more light

353
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
but they're not getting enough light

354
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,439
they want 24 hours of light to get these

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,040
clones going that would help you out um

356
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
i don't know your light schedule we did

357
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,719
not include that in the question so i

358
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
don't have any data uh to work with

359
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
there but my first guess is more light

360
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,319
dude longer light cycle and we will do a

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,240
podcast on dli here coming up

362
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,399
uh where are we they go into flour and

363
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
re-veg most of the time they go into

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,078
flour and re-veg yeah if you give them

365
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,000
more light they won't go into flour ah

366
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,159
that should work all of my leaves turn

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,440
yellow and get crispy so that is either

368
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,519
over feed underfeed or improper humidity

369
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
um

370
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,879
and i don't have a reading on your

371
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
humidity i'm looking at this paper again

372
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,159
it says i always get nice and healthy

373
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,480
roots but it takes forever to get them

374
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,719
to snap back and turn healthy again this

375
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,120
is the same for mothers uh that i cut

376
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,480
from clone or from seed i use an

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
oxycloner with hormex or clonex ph to

378
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,019
5.8 ish

379
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,638
um

380
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,319
[Music]

381
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,879
i've said this before i'll say it again

382
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,200
your meter doesn't have an ish on it

383
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,320
your meter puts out numbers your number

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,000
on the meter isn't 5.8 ish what's the

385
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
number on the meter buddy that's what

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,919
you should have typed right there that

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,759
ah that's going to tell me a lot so i

388
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,399
use a humidifier to keep the humidity up

389
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,879
in the 70 range any pointers would be

390
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,600
very appreciated it sounds like you

391
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,799
might uh what is the i want to know you

392
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
can message me back because there are

393
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,759
things i want to know in here what is

394
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,120
the uh

395
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,198
the ppms or the ec of the solution in

396
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,120
the oxy cloner what else did you put in

397
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,359
there you got uh hormex or clonex ph258

398
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
uh what's your ec what's your ppms how

399
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,759
much that hormex or clonex are you

400
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,679
putting in there um

401
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,759
and then how hot is that water that

402
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,278
water could be getting too hot or that

403
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,958
water could be getting too cold which

404
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,799
doesn't sound likely because you're

405
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,958
getting the roots i really think you

406
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,120
need more light

407
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,799
and i want to know what how much of your

408
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
solution you're using but honestly i

409
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,519
think the first thing i'm going to say

410
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
you said they're vegging they're going

411
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
into flour and reveg which is a light

412
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,039
issue that's what does that so feed them

413
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,799
properly and get them light and make

414
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,120
sure that the water in that cloner is

415
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,759
nice and cool that'll help you out a lot

416
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,839
uh 70 humidity range that's going to

417
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,000
help you but in my experience when i'm

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,440
using the cloners like that humidity

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,278
isn't super

420
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
uh critical to be real high it's more

421
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,240
important to keep that water uh phd and

422
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,679
properly nutriented keep in mind now

423
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
you're using an arrow cloner that's

424
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,120
bubbling constantly or

425
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,560
if it's getting too hot here's something

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
you can do we got two things two things

427
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,919
of thought to think about now if it's

428
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
getting too hot give it downtime let it

429
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,838
turn off let it bubble for 15 or for 50

430
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,920
minutes maybe 45 then give it 15 to 10

431
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,000
minutes off to cool down the other thing

432
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,599
i was gonna say it's constantly bubbling

433
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
or almost constantly bubbling you're

434
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,440
making bubbles you're putting

435
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
water through movement you're putting

436
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
air into the water which is going to

437
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,519
create a lot of evaporation when the

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,000
water evaporates the nutrients that are

439
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,000
salts do not evaporate so those salts

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,879
are staying there in your reservoir in

441
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,360
the base the water is evaporating uh now

442
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,039
your ppms your ec and your ph are all

443
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
going to fluctuate so you're gonna have

444
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,120
to check that on a daily basis uh

445
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
sometimes on a twice daily basis

446
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,120
depending on the size of the machine uh

447
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,719
your temperature how much the how much

448
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,639
your plants are eating like how much

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,440
water is being eaten how much is uh

450
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,560
evaporating so check that check the ph

451
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,839
the ec the tds of that water frequently

452
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,359
you're setting it up and you're saying

453
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,000
it's at five eight right now that's

454
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,919
legit on day one uh but by day two day

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,240
three it's gone up or it's gone down

456
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,479
some direction uh check the the

457
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
temperature also those are things that i

458
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,278
really think will help you out i don't

459
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,319
have a definitive answer because i don't

460
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,399
have uh enough definitive data so feel

461
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
free please do send me more data and i

462
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,198
will again respond and try to get you

463
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,120
more feedback all right big thanks to

podcaster a lot of you may know by now

481
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,600
that i'm a breeder and i do make seeds

482
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,159
i'm irie genetics of course we talked

483
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,278
about that uh but uh you might not know

484
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,639
that i'm a drummer i've played drums

485
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,159
since i was 15. um i'm approaching 43 at

486
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,198
this point i don't say that very often

487
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,958
on the show but i've been playing the

488
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,399
drums for a minute can read and write

489
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,399
music understand that a lot of people

490
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,759
want me to whip out a drum solo

491
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,759
there are videos from 2008 on youtube if

492
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,039
you search hard enough all right but uh

493
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
bro you're very welcome thank you for

494
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,879
the love thank you for the respect and

495
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,360
appreciation and the compliments

496
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,160
there is a lot to this one it says first

497
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,240
here is my setup i only grow regular or

498
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
feminized i've never tried autos i'm an

499
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,519
old hippie that's cool i don't really

500
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,958
mess with the autoflowers either

501
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,000
there's a couple reasons why i like the

502
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,279
regulars uh bet that's regs femmes or

503
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
well that's photos is what we're trying

504
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,558
to say here there's a reason why i like

505
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
the photo periods uh regs or films don't

506
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,678
matter to me i can work with both um it

507
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,558
says i've got quite a few 4x8 flower veg

508
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,200
mother clone ceiling mother and dry

509
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,960
tents i do a lot of pheno hunting in

510
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,120
very small plants i'm using

511
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,798
750 liter nursery bags those nursery

512
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,839
bags are about the size of a solo cup

513
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,879
that's what i imagine when you said 750

514
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,639
point 750 liters i did read that wrong i

515
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
read it right said it wrong

516
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
then it says i used the paper towel

517
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,320
method for 24 to 48 hours until roots

518
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
show then in jiffy pucks with 24 to 0

519
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,200
hours of light

520
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,038
24 on xero off after seven days

521
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,919
12 12 in the nursery bags filled with

522
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,240
cocoa only at 400 uh ppfd that's a

523
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,799
photosynthetic photon flux density and

524
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,319
up to 900 ppfd near the end of flower no

525
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,480
co2 remo nutrients i grow 16 or 25

526
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,798
plants per 4x4 square that is a great

527
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,558
setup i miss those days dude and you

528
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,160
guys i did go really fast over a lot of

529
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,599
those ah and it's not going to be

530
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
important for some of the questions that

531
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,319
for the questions coming up but some of

532
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,000
you will understand and appreciate those

533
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:30,240
details uh i get it uh growing 16 to 25

534
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,919
plants per 4x4 depending on the strain

535
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,679
uh the width lanky branches and i cut

536
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
most of the sides off to get only a few

537
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,840
most of the time i love this style if we

538
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,080
weren't limited by numbers here i would

539
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,798
grow this style uh in my personal home

540
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,199
grow back in the day allegedly before i

541
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,798
was known before i uh was people knew

542
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,519
who i was and what i was doing we may

543
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,200
have done stuff similar to this uh in

544
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,038
home grows and we may have crushed it it

545
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
may have been a cool idea also a great

546
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,240
way to breed because you can fit a lot

547
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
of phenotypes in there and you can see a

548
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
lot of things and you can breed a lot of

549
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,918
things and it really speeds you up

550
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
all right uh it says where am i so i'm

551
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,559
doing it so i can maximize real estate

552
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,639
and they have a full canopy like

553
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,879
scroggers but without a net yes i

554
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
totally understand it's a sea of green

555
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
instead of a screen of green and he did

556
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,880
throw out the letters a sog so he

557
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
understands now it does say my question

558
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
and i've been rambling for a long time

559
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,558
so i'm glad we got to this part this is

560
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
my question since these are small pots

561
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,200
they're 12 to 20 inches do i get our

562
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,879
plants that are 12 to 20 inches do i get

563
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
the full expression of the plant

564
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
regarding effects aroma and taste just

565
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,558
like a normal veg and fully grown plant

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,240
i only grow for the effect the rest are

567
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,839
just bonuses big cheers from canadian

568
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,919

question big cheers back at you brother

570
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,200
i like this because this is how i like

571
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,840
the testers that i give out to be ran i

572
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
give a lot of test seeds out to people

573
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,639
a lot of people have been asking about

574
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,038
being testers also by the way if you

575
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
want to be a tester there is an episode

576
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,279
of this podcast the grow from your heart

577
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,798
podcast is titled testers

578
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,960
listen to that once you've listened to

579
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,240
that then follow the appropriate steps

580
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,400
after that you'll have to send me an

581
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,640
email you will also be required and

582
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,120
requested to join my discord server and

583
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
join the tester tab if you're already

584
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,519
testing for me and you're not posting

585
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
pictures in the discord tester tab

586
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,558
please do that i would appreciate it

587
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
that's how you get more test seeds in

588
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,918
the future that's where all of the

589
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
testing will be kept and done and

590
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
journaled and documented and highlighted

591
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
um

592
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,798
but that is how i like to do the testers

593
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,558
i like small plants uh because why are

594
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,720
we gonna run gigantic plants if we don't

595
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,279
know if they're any good and like you're

596
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,480
saying um i don't think we need big-ass

597
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,480
plants so you're asking if we're gonna

598
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,599
see the full expression i think so yes

599
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,839
in my opinion i've grown um

600
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,678
so i've grown a lot of plants in cups i

601
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,959
do that that's how i test brand new [ __ ]

602
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,880
like i said i just made let's say i just

603
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
made a brand new batch of seeds i don't

604
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
want to grow it in a 10 gallon pot and

605
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
get it [ __ ] 10 feet tall and spend

606
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,519
six months on it to find out that it's a

607
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,440
male or it's intersex or it's trash i

608
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,759
want to grow a bunch of plants in small

609
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,558
pots in a small space just like this guy

610
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,519
and see what i've created so i would do

611
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,918
i had a tray that would hold 24 cups

612
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,000
beautifully 24 28 doesn't matter it

613
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,440
holds them perfectly once i got the tray

614
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,759
out set it up i would remember quickly i

615
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,360
think it's 24. i could fit 24 cups in

616
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,839
this tray could fit two of those under a

617
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,399
light beautifully that's 48 seedlings i

618
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,399
would veg them tiny flower them out see

619
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,240
what they do then i would keep the best

620
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,840
out of those i would re-veg those and

621
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,400
grow them again or i just let them go

622
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,678
and re redo more seeds but what i have

623
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,679
done is i've grown the same thing in

624
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
little cups and in big pots and i've

625
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,919
seen the ah similar results they show

626
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
you the same thing and honestly in my

627
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,640
experience what i've noticed and what

628
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,960
other growers will probably agree with

629
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,038
those big giant plants become more

630
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
problematic more prone to problems more

631
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,919
prone to pre more prone to pests

632
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,558
pathogens diseases issues you got to

633
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,000
prop them up they start falling over uh

634
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,440
they get more problematic that's the

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,759
bottom line right there the smaller

636
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,440
younger plants you don't get as much uh

637
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,200
time to [ __ ] up the less time you're on

638
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,840
the road the longer you have to crash so

639
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,279
go faster get to the finish line so let

640
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,519
me get back on my notes because i do

641
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,678
have notes written here in my experience

642
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,599
in my opinion you will see that full

643
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,960
expression those hormones are going to

644
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,639
develop the things are going to happen

645
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,558
just like they need to

646
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
you'll see those plants in my experience

647
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,440
the small plants if i were going to

648
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,000
enter a competition for buds to see who

649
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,480
grows the best buds photogenic wise

650
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
flavor aroma potency overall cannabis

651
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,400
cup winning weed i would not grow giant

652
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,080
plants i would grow small to medium

653
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,759
sized plants and i'd grow several of

654
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,879
them is the way i would prefer to do

655
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,679
that

656
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,000
um i feel like they spend less energy on

657
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,400
growing uh less energy on supporting

658
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,319
themselves on beefing up uh they've got

659
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,759
so much energy already in that small

660
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,200
ceiling they're ready to go we do

661
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,919
provide light and all that [ __ ] but i

662
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,759
mean

663
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,320
like i just think they have more energy

664
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,240
they get better they focus more on bud

665
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,918
development potency flavor the things

666
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,759
that we want when we're not trying to

667
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,000
make them gigantic and make them support

668
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,158
themselves and be branches and i just

669
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
think they're better smaller honestly so

670
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,640
in my honest opinion my experience i

671
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,480
would prefer smaller plants

672
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,038
i don't know that i would always go with

673
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,038
the tiny nursery pots i may go just the

674
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,519
one step above that like a one gallon

675
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,720
but if your plants are making you happy

676
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,759
it sounds like you're doing a great job

677
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
it smells sounds like you're a great

678
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,960
person you can make decisions i think

679
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,359
you've got the right idea in the bottom

680
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,200
line i do think if you're growing them

681
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,959
properly giving them their love and care

682
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,798
you're mentioning how much ppfd you're

683
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
giving them you talked about nutrients i

684
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,480
would assume with that many details in

685
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,440
this note that your plants are getting

686
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,798
very close to their maximum potential uh

687
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,960
