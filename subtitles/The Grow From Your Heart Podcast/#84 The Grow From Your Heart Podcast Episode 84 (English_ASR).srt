66
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,330
working on getting a portable recording

67
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,239
device

68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,560
I want the Zune h6 so that I could take

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,240
the show on the road a little bit more

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
my recording gear that I have now is

71
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,990
kind of bulky a little cumbersome yes

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,030
but the device I'm looking at will be

73
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,740
able to go to any event will be able to

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,340

75
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,140
my backpack

76
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,360
we'll have podcasts coming from all

77
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,818
kinds of crazy places to those donations

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,370
helped a lot that will work out in the

79
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,899
very near future hopefully if anybody

80
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,219
out there wants to sponsor the podcast

81
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,510
just send me an email let's go from your

82
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,310
heart at hotmail.com I'll get you all

83
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,189
the information you need we can get your

84
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,069
product advertised to a target audience

85
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,359
of about 5,000 people per week plus all

86
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,189
the people that go back and listen to

87
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,540
the catalogued episodes so it's really

88
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,719
good idea to advertise with a

89
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,000
cannabis-related podcast because I think

90
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,180
that's all the advertising I've got I've

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,689
got some news articles hear the current

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,519
news Mike informed me of today was the

93
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,739
day that the Colorado Department of

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,209
Public Health and Environment actually

95
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:27,569
decided to deny PTSD as a qualifying

96
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,750
condition for medically recommended

97
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,859
cannabis in the state of Colorado

98
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,930
so in Colorado there are eight

99
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,010
qualifying conditions and all eight of

100
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,700
them were passed by the law back in 2000

101
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,689
so the CDP aichi hasn't added a single

102
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,889
qualifying condition and all that time

103
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,949
and this is the third time they've

104
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:50,279
denied PTSD you know I think PTSD is

105
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,509
definitely a qualifying condition it's

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,060
[ __ ] that they're not allowing that

107
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:55,859
it definitely should be and how many and

108
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,259
hour days work in the counter how many

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,170
people came in specifically saying I've

110
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,449
got PTSD marijuana out so much I love

111
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,099
that you guys are here absolutely so are

112
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,048
we is the Colorado Department of Public

113
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,519
Health and Environment basically giving

114
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,230
their finger to veterans and telling

115
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,810
veterans to go drink alcohol instead of

116
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,479
consuming cannabis to help themselves

117
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,819
that's basically been the effect of

118
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,279
their policy for the last decade or so

119
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,379
so guys what they were trying to do is

120
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,418
people that have PTSD they were trying

121
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,439
to get that as a qualifying condition to

122
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,240
get your medical marijuana

123
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,348
recommendation

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,900
from the doctor here in the state of

125
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:32,839
Colorado and it has been denied three

126
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:37,299
times now we cannot get post-traumatic

127
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:39,560
stress disorder as a condition that is

128
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,860
qualified that could be treated with

129
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,598
medical marijuana and it's not just vets

130
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,348
there's a lot of people out in the

131
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:49,519
community that have pts or PTSD and

132
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:51,860
marijuana helps a lot of them and now

133
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,810
they can't can sit down and talk to

134
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,910
their doctor about using cannabis

135
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,439
directly for that they'd have to if they

136
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,370
wanted to join the medical program have

137
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,918
to have one of the other eight

138
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,930
qualifying conditions or at least here

139
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:04,399
they can still visit the REC market and

140
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,949
just pay a lot more than they would in

141
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,598
our medical right which doesn't allow

142
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,129
them to grow the product that they need

143
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:11,598
you know that's that's a big part of

144
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,250
having your medical marijuana card is

145
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:15,168
being able to grow or being able to

146
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,598
assign a caregiver to grow for you

147
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:20,149
that's a big part of it right trying to

148
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:22,098
do three plants in your backyard or if

149
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,888
that's allowed in your area and whatnots

150
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:27,019
just brutal difficult already if you're

151
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,819
already suffering PTSD like now you've

152
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:30,348
got to protect yourself from you know

153
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,879
all the paranoia that comes with growing

154
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:35,029
my right for the first time you know I

155
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,649
think a large portion of the population

156
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,698
has some form of post-traumatic stress

157
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,799
disorder

158
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,629
whether it be childhood trauma anything

159
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,590
you can see something very little when

160
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:44,569
you're a child and that you're a

161
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,918
psychology kid a psychology student

162
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,509
something really little when you're a

163
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,370
kid can really [ __ ] you up permanently

164
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,408
if you don't take it right there was a

165
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,959
study looking at kids and some of the

166
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:56,629
rougher parts of Chicago and it was like

167
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:59,478
80% of the kids exhibited some symptoms

168
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:01,129
of PTSD and a lot of people started

169
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,500
calling it just they've dropped the D

170
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,750
and so it's no longer disorder it's just

171
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,228
post-traumatic stress it's what the

172
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,089
human body and brain does after a

173
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:14,029
seriously traumatic incident sometimes

174
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:17,060
in a lot of people coming home from war

175
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,399
or that have witnessed domestic violence

176
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,319
or been victim domestic violence or have

177
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,968
seen car crashes somebody I've seen

178
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,439
somebody die in a car crash and it's in

179
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:26,089
the back of my mind every time we're on

180
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,319
the highway I always get a little

181
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,060
flashback of that and I don't like

182
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,158
u-turns for the same reason yeah you've

183
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,860
told me that amazing story there yep

184
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:36,560
yeah so what I was headed for is I was

185
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,000
gonna imply that I don't know what event

186
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
it is but I know there's some sort of

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,949
post traumatic

188
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,329
stress in my mind from my life and

189
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,770
that's why I said everybody's probably

190
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:46,050
got it so I don't have a significant

191
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:48,089
event that I can recall but I have seen

192
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,699
some [ __ ] and I know that when I feel

193
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,188
even if you've got stress of the day

194
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,900
when you smoke it distracts you and it

195
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,810
calms that part of your brain down and

196
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,278
it allows you to not obsess on that

197
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,709
thought and lets you kind of break free

198
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:02,999
of that a little bit the big thing a lot

199
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,848
of the people that I know that we're

200
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:08,550
treating their PTSD with cannabis would

201
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:10,139
talk about is the dreamless sleep that

202
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,879
was the big benefit that they talked

203
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,978
about at least when they were in the

204
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,930
shop so it would stop their dreams yep

205
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,269
it's uh I mean I haven't

206
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,129
I barely dream and I attribute that to

207
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,649
cannabis use because when I don't smoke

208
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,919
I have very vivid dreams just regularly

209
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,538
that's odd because people have asked me

210
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,490
what I like to smoke and I say I like to

211
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,528
smoke a heavy heavy sativa right before

212
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,750
bed because it makes my mind do that

213
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:35,759
laundry thing and so I close my eyes and

214
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,288
I feel like I just dream instantly

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
because I'm already right there at that

216
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:40,378
thing you know what I mean could you

217
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,149
smoke that really high head high sativa

218
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,680
and I just close my eyes and then my

219
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,060
dreams or claymation and they just

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,709
happen as soon as my eyes closed and

221
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,680
then I sleep really well on a heavy

222
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,968
sativa and I have huge dreams from it so

223
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,528
that's kind of strange that it stops

224
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:53,639
other people's dreams which I'm not

225
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,528
gonna argue that if it's working for

226
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,019
them that's amazing do the right well I

227
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,610
asked you one day like you still dream

228
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,318
bro and you looked at me like offended

229
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,270
like of course why would no I have an

230
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,460
amazing dream isn't yeah I I just

231
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:07,740
assumed that that the effect was

232
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,810
something you got to cuz you consume way

233
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,639
more than me sometimes I can control my

234
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,889
dreams a little bit but if I get too

235
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,838
carried away I wake myself up but so I

236
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,579
know I'm like don't influence this dream

237
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:19,800
too much but also kind of guided a

238
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,688
little like but if I if I push too hard

239
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,338
I wake myself up out of the dream no I

240
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:24,689
haven't had a dream like eight years

241
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:27,930
that's beautiful oh man I dream

242
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:29,639
constantly I wake up talking oh [ __ ] or

243
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,610
something like that out of a dream right

244
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,620
yeah it's funny alright so if you guys

245
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,528
are working on getting medical marijuana

246
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,820
in your area in your state please while

247
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,769
you're writing the bills while you're

248
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,028
writing the rules please put in some

249
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,310
sort of a clause that includes

250
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:45,659
post-traumatic stress disorder it's not

251
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:48,088
something that you can see but it is

252
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,439
something that definitely exists we need

253
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,900
it for our veterans more than anything

254
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,360
but it's also for everybody let's

255
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,250
be fair out there you guys yeah not all

256
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,810
medical conditions are visible that's

257
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,299
something you got to keep in mind right

258
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:02,639
the bill well we uh we here in Colorado

259
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,620
all assume that the CD Phe would be

260
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,480
willing to add other conditions to the

261
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,090
lists of currently accepted conditions

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,950
over time but there's been countless

263
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,139
applications at this point I can't

264
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,040
remember how many but it's like 15 or 20

265
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:16,289
Wow

266
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,110
PTSD has been up three times and they've

267
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,610
denied everything just flat-out nope not

268
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,070
at this time there's not enough research

269
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,350
showing that there is you know a general

270
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,180
effect and there isn't research done

271
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,860
because it's not allowed yet not enough

272
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,439
research unless you're to a veteran harm

273
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,149
you can't do your research until very

274
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,880
very like within the last few months

275
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,819
recently so these studies are being

276
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,879
drawn up now they will be conducted in

277
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,770
the next year or seven the you know

278
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,830
findings will be out and become public

279
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,509
knowledge ten years from then okay and

280
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,580
we're just gonna keep letting people

281
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,919
suffer or I mean at least in Colorado

282
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,110
they can use the rec market or right I

283
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,269
mean it's not like the black-market ever

284
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,070
wonder what way here it has had to step

285
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:03,000
up its game considerably to continue to

286
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,490
compete but it will never decent options

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,440
and then once the vet has the bud here

288
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,600
in Colorado it's legal again so all

289
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,430
right so it's no good here but we didn't

290
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,170
take a step forward today and that sucks

291
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,209
that's yeah we stayed we stumbled over

292
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:20,039
our own dicks once again so make sure

293
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,420
you guys include the PTSD when you write

294
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,539
your new medical marijuana bill that's

295
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,649
my main point here and the next time it

296
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,909
comes up that we're trying to vote on

297
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,769
this make sure you support it because I

298
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,389
fully think that PTSD is a qualifying

299
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,220
condition get registered to vote

300
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,439
marijuana will be on your ballot in the

301
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,320
next two years yes it will yes it will

302
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,870
if it's not on the ballot in 2015 vote

303
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,240
anyway and just practice that [ __ ] there

304
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,789
you go be ready for 2016 because it will

305
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,450
then so we talked a little bit in the

306
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:52,649
last episode about the desire for Denver

307
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,690
voters to want consumption in some

308
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,740
establishments where people are over 21

309
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:00,960
and they're not smoking inside on where

310
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,029
is the date okay it was July 9th the

311
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,750
cannabis posted an update to that

312
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,809
article and

313
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,889
says Denver voters favor limited pot use

314
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,139
in bars

315
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,090
it says Denver marijuana poll a majority

316
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,889
of voters in the city support an

317
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,970
initiative that would allow limited pot

318
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:21,509
use no indoor smoking at businesses over

319
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:23,190
21 businesses such as bars so it's been

320
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,289
voted on this article was written by

321
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,880
Ricardo Baca from the cannabis staff I'm

322
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:28,649
a skip part of it because we just need

323
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,840
to get to the point here but it says a

324
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,429
majority of Denver voters support an

325
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,899
initiative that would allow limited

326
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,489
social marijuana consumption in

327
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,169
businesses such as bars according to a

328
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,940
poll commissioned by the group behind

329
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,529
the proposal the cannabis has learned

330
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,660
exclusively I kind of read that weird

331
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,389
but I think you got it yeah the people

332
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:47,189
that wrote up the bill paid for a poll

333
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,429
and the poll says voters are gonna

334
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:53,100
support it so fingers crossed it I mean

335
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:56,279
they're there poll doesn't if you're

336
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,009
really into politics their poll it says

337
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,449
that voters supported by 56% if they add

338
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,210
in the people that are totally not gonna

339
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,860
[ __ ] vote is that really give a [ __ ]

340
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,780
they're just like sure whatever would

341
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,180
support that but I'm gonna go support

342
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:14,730
that I would but there's television on

343
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:16,979
that night so net but I don't I hope it

344
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,289
passes in 2015 the need for this is huge

345
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,960
it's huge but the poll data does not

346
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:24,419
look favorable right now if more of us

347
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,860
don't get politically active true well

348
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,279
they actually says the poll results say

349
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,500
only 56 percent of likely Denver voters

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,419
either strongly support or somewhat

351
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,950
support the initiative according to the

352
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:40,049
democratic firm Public Policy Polling so

353
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,360
56% isn't a bold number that's nope

354
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,649
that's six percent away from losing yeah

355
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,419
and when you really look at the polling

356
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:48,959
data it's something like thirty percent

357
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,039
are like gung-ho about it in twenty six

358
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,620
percent don't give a [ __ ]

359
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,259
it says here for those against the

360
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,120
initiative 31% strongly oppose and nine

361
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,610
percent somewhat opposed it while five

362
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
percent said they weren't sure right it

363
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,450
was an automated telephone poll and it's

364
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,640
got a margin of error of three point

365
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,140
nine percentage points so this is just a

366
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,879
telephone poll people on the telephone

367
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,080
will say that they will do anything cuz

368
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,750
all you got to do is sit there and press

369
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,129
one for yes and two for no and three for

370
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,139
English right that's all they had to

371
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:17,490
worry about so yeah a lot of these

372
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,649
people probably won't come

373
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,058
and vote so the pollsters asked whether

374
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,528
voters would support allowing the

375
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:24,028
consumption of marijuana at private

376
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:25,948
venues in Denver provided that the owner

377
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,629
of the venue permits the consumption

378
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:29,729
access to the venue is limited to

379
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,069
individuals 21 years of age of older and

380
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,050
smoking marijuana indoors is prohibited

381
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:37,828
and any outdoor uses hidden from public

382
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:40,198
view that's all fair that makes sense

383
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:43,708
it's really not that but it's that of a

384
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:47,729
bill and it's fairly sorry guys dabs and

385
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:50,578
soda yeah um it's a pretty fair bill you

386
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,459
got to be outside and it's got to be 25

387
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:55,078
feet from wherever public gather so what

388
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,979
I'm envisioning is a shitload of roof

389
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,318
deck type establishments in Denver where

390
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,999
they just there's a couple of bars that

391
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:04,919
we're already doing this and if you felt

392
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:09,389
like being outside you couldn't smoke up

393
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:11,610
there tobacco or usually the last time I

394
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:14,159
was up there but now they're gonna allow

395
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,869
marijuana up there or at least 25 feet

396
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,399
away from the public so like in a model

397
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:19,410
back courtyard that's all fenced off

398
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,778
yeah there are several like servantes

399
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:24,568
servantes other side in Denver has got

400
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,610
the perfect little area for smoking that

401
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:28,289
would be sweet what's that other place

402
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,490
where we go to that there are a lot of

403
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,990
clubs up there that have nice little

404
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,749
outdoor areas that would be beautiful to

405
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,249
smoke in which to smoke yeah so just let

406
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:37,110
us do it they said that they're

407
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,689
gathering 5,000 signatures to get the

408
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,829
question on Denver's November ballot

409
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:42,419
another one of the poll findings that

410
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,368
Denver residents by a 4 to 1 ratio

411
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,409
believe that alcohol causes more

412
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:48,178
problems in the city than marijuana and

413
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:50,639
also favors their side of the

414
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,869
contentious issue Denver voters have

415
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,459
made it quite clear that they support

416
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:55,709
treating marijuana like alcohol said

417
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,388
Mason divert a national pot activist and

418
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,818
one of the primary authors behind

419
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:02,308
Colorado's original cannabis legalizing

420
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:05,039
amendment 64 Isis voters approved

421
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:07,588
measures to I measures to the effect in

422
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:11,368
2000 what measures to the effect in 2005

423
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,170
2006 2007 and 2012 and so it's not

424
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,360
surprising that we're still seeing such

425
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,610
strong support even among a more

426
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,619
conservative voting population in an

427
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,329
off-year election so people are

428
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:24,059
supporting it more surprisingly than we

429
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:25,769
had anticipated even a poll this goods a

430
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,480
little surprising the people who follow

431
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,489
this

432
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,230
so I I mean I wish them the best of luck

433
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:32,720
if I lived in Denver they'd have my vote

434
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,399
it says in the question that asked

435
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,249
respondents if alcohol or marijuana

436
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,149
cause more problems in Denver 55% said

437
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:44,928
alcohol 13% said marijuana 26% said both

438
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:47,208
and 6% were not sure so we're making it

439
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:48,798
obvious here that alcohol is the problem

440
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,358
in cannabis is the peaceful way to

441
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:53,058
gather and celebrate and have a good

442
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:56,600
time and relax the last paragraph of the

443
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:58,399
article says by more than four to one

444
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,869
margin in Denver voters cite alcohol

445
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,730
over marijuana as a bigger source of

446
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,619
problems in the city said divert anyone

447
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,688
who has spent time in the loto on a

448
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,339
weekend evening or walk down Colfax

449
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:09,528
Avenue on any given day knows that

450
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,629
alcohol contributes to far more problems

451
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:14,359
and far more severe problems than

452
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,789
marijuana he said which if you go out on

453
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:19,459
almost any major city any big city on

454
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,379
the weekends you if you go to the bar

455
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,458
where is that every downtown's got that

456
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,678
one area where there's a nice

457
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,958
congregation of bars and everybody goes

458
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:28,818
there and about 1 o'clock on Friday

459
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,858
night out of one of the bars erupts a

460
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:33,078
big ass fight and then after the bar

461
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,429
spills out and they all push this [ __ ]

462
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,168
out of each other and then the cops come

463
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:38,538
and a few people get arrested and then

464
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:40,100
you hear about it's Saturday um that

465
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,409
doesn't happen in weed events and if it

466
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,100
does we we shun those people from the

467
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:47,778
community and they don't come back right

468
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,909
cannabis is a peaceful drug like alcohol

469
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:52,818
is the problem for sure so I think if

470
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:55,068
they should if they let us smoke at

471
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:56,238
clubs and stuff I would go I don't go to

472
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:57,918
places because I don't drink alcohol

473
00:16:56,239 --> 00:17:00,168
there's no reason for me to be there but

474
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,239
if I can go take a few dad's I'd be more

475
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:04,250
likely to go to the shows at the local

476
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:06,318
venues because even though it's not my

477
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,699
kind of music I would go be social if I

478
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,470
could go dab out and have fun there

479
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:10,970
right we're not antisocial we're just

480
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,278
sick of explaining that we don't drink

481
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,870
yeah I don't I do not want a beer but

482
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,828
thank you and no it's not because I'm

483
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,778
better than you it's because I don't

484
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:20,178
want to be an [ __ ] I'm a drunken

485
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:21,470
[ __ ] when I drink I wasn't an [ __ ]

486
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,649
I just don't want the hangover anymore

487
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,269
oh yeah I do the hangover is terrible

488
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:28,729

545
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,490
episode the article says this is also

546
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,980
from the cannabis stand it was written

547
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,160
by Gene Johnson of The Associated Press

548
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,049
the headline is one year in seventy

549
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,240
million dollars in pot taxes and other

550
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,369
lessons from Washington on the

551
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,960
sub-headline we get a headline and a sub

552
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,909
headline now in articles it's great the

553
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,149
Internet is [ __ ] up our heads with

554
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,219
250 million

555
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,199
in marijuana sales Washington still has

556
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:57,298
room to grow as its ninth largest grower

557
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,788
says it's amazing we could be so

558
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:02,098
successful and unsuccessful at the same

559
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:04,138
time the article goes on to say

560
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:05,968
Washington launched its second in the

561
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,498
nation legal marijuana market with just

562
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,838
a handful of stores selling high-priced

563
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,460
pot to long lines of customers a year

564
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:14,009
later the state has about a hundred and

565
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,308
sixty shops open pot tax revenues have

566
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:20,489
soared past expectations and sales top

567
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:23,009
1.4 million dollars per day they're

568
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:26,098
making 1.4 million dollars per day on

569
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,690
cannabis in Washington right now it also

570
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:29,298
goes on to San who knows the industry

571
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,619
might even start making some money

572
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:33,628
Washington pot farmers processors and

573
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:35,218
retailers have complained all years of

574
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:36,418
heavy state and federal tax burdens

575
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:38,190
along with competition from an

576
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,629
unregulated medical marijuana market

577
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,330
have made it difficult for them to do

578
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:45,028
business but at least some relief is

579
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:47,128
there as here this month two new laws

580
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:48,719
take effect one to regulate and tax

581
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,968
medical marijuana and one to cut

582
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:54,599
Washington's three-level excise pot tax

583
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:57,538
to a single 37 percent tax that's higher

584
00:20:54,598 --> 00:21:00,200
than Colorado tax yeah that's the big

585
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:04,858
lesson between Washington and Colorado

586
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,749
is that the free market applies we see

587
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:09,449
it in Colorado there are a lot of people

588
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:12,028
that are that have been smoking

589
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,038
marijuana here for 4050 years and the

590
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:17,690
only time they visit the stores is for

591
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,919
novelty write the occasional selection

592
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,450
for the most part they're still buying

593
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,288
marijuana where they used to because

594
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,509
it's half the price yes yes in

595
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:30,538
Washington the taxes are so bad that

596
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:34,829
almost none of the locals are interested

597
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:36,538
because they're taxing it look 75% it's

598
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:38,668
like 25 percent three different times

599
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:41,460
and so by the time it gets to the

600
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,589
consumer at grams like 60 bucks in what

601
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,608
the [ __ ] yeah who's gonna pay that when

602
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:47,128
you can just go to the dude on the

603
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:47,908
corner and get it for 12 or 15 right

604
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:50,009
yeah

605
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,869
okay so article goes on to say despite

606
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,618
some industry gripes and those tweaks to

607
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:57,808
Washington's legal pot law marijuana

608
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:59,548
which marijuana law which voters passed

609
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:01,858
in 2012 to legalize marijuana for adults

610
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:03,298
over 21 officials and legalization

611
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:04,439
backers say the state's slow and

612
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:06,779
deliberate effort to regulate

613
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,120
marijuana has been a success a year

614
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,399
after stores opened on July 8th 2014

615
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,519
here's a look at the state of legal weed

616
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,230
here it says the taxes Washington racked

617
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,059
up more than 250 million dollars in

618
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,819
marijuana sales in the past year roughly

619
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:23,250
62 million dollars of which constitute

620
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,470
marijuana excise taxes that's beyond the

621
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,660
state's original forecast of 36 million

622
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,210
and when the state and local sales and

623
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,830
other shops other taxes are included the

624
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,259
total payday for the state and local

625
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:38,099
government tops seventy million dollars

626
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:41,210
okay so the interesting number there is

627
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:44,279
the 62 million excise tax in Colorado

628
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,049
the excise tax is what's supposed to pay

629
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,139
that forty million dollars for schools

630
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,849
and we've already crushed in the first

631
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,250
five months of this year last year's

632
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:55,439
whole year total nice because the

633
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,960
standalone production markets only just

634
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,700
now coming online yeah all the shops had

635
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,700
to produce their own for the longest

636
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,080
time here and so that was the

637
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,170
infrastructure we started with and

638
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,689
because of that that excise tax was real

639
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
small here in Colorado and that's the

640
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,279
huge difference between our taxes in

641
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,920
their taxes is by the time it gets to

642
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,230
the Shelf that excise taxes nuts yes

643
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,190
only 10 million of theirs was in sales

644
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:25,970
tax we collected like 60 or 40 or

645
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,180
something like that in just sales tax I

646
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,039
hope when the nationwide legalization

647
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,350
happens I hope all these crazy taxes are

648
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,609
done away with or adjusted somehow right

649
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:38,099
it's gimmick it's gonna have to come

650
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,659
back down to reality or they won't

651
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,889
matter so much because they're charging

652
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:47,210
you thirty six percent tax on a $2 gram

653
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,230
which is entirely feasible which from

654
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,610
there may they're growing a lot of

655
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,860
cannabis right now and in Washington

656
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:55,619
they may grow more than they're able to

657
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,929
sell is something that I see possibly

658
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,149
happening so that really could happen it

659
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,370
could go really dirty cheap pretty soon

660
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,930
here I don't see how long we've been

661
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:05,189
recording and we might yeah we're gonna

662
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,650
read the rest of this article and we're

663
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,420
gonna save the yeah I got one more

664
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,830
article we'll get into so the next sub

665
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,690
headline and this article says isn't

666
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,889
legal weed expensive in Washington and

667
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,029
it goes on to say a few growers

668
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,630
harvesting by the first time sorry let

669
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,069
me read it again

670
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,840
cuz it's moving there we go with a few

671
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,609
growers harvesting by the time the first

672
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,199
store just opened the average price of a

673
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:27,329
gram of legal marijuana sparked

674
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,430
spikes to nearly 30 dollars last summer

675
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:31,289
about three times the cost in medical

676
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,060
marijuana shops but prices have been

677
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,509
dropping as more weed gets harvested in

678
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:38,460
fact Washington has harvested 13.5 tons

679
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,859
of marijuana flower intended to be sold

680
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,590
as bud but stores have only sold about

681
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,839
10 tons some of the excess can be turned

682
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:47,459
into marijuana extracts such as oil but

683
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,459
the harvest has helped drive down the

684
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,049
prices to an average of about 1150 per

685
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,400
gram so I was a little bit right about

686
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:55,829
that they grew too much and it's getting

687
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,150
cheaper nevertheless that in addition to

688
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,799
tourists eager to visit the city's

689
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,509
historic first legal pot shop his

690
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,019
clientele primarily consists of

691
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,609
customers in the 25 and older range it's

692
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,619
more of an adult demographic but that's

693
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,199
okay says they have jobs and they can

694
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,729
afford to buy the product

695
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,259
the next headline says so what's next

696
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,539
Rick Garza director of the Washington's

697
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,069
liquor board Liquor Control Board soon

698
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,930
to be renamed the liquor and cannabis

699
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:21,539
board says he's proud of Washington's

700
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,220
efforts at a meeting at the top rep at

701
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,720
meeting the top priorities the Justice

702
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,309
Department laid out when it announced it

703
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,450
would allow Washington Colorado and

704
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:29,700
other states to regulate marijuana

705
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,259
keeping criminal organizations out of

706
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,509
the industry keeping the marijuana

707
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:36,150
in-state and keeping pot away from the

708
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:37,410
kids it goes on to say the state adopted

709
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,540
background checks and financial

710
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,830
investigations of pot license applicants

711
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,119
and capped the total amount of

712
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:44,939
production to try to keep it in line

713
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,500
with in-state demand while public health

714
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,180
advocates say they wish the state had

715
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,099
done more to stress the potential harms

716
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,299
of pot to teens the state required

717
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,649
strict packaging and labeling

718
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,480
requirements to keep children from

719
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,530
getting into the weed they did the same

720
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,990
thing here we kind of set a little

721
00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:00,269
standard here I think the products that

722
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,870
appeal to kids also remain banned no

723
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:05,190
marijuana cotton candy or gummy bears

724
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:06,719
also clawed you can't get the sweets no

725
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,470
bears up there that's terrible I'm sorry

726
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,079
bro

727
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,019
yeah everything here sold them the

728
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,579
childproof packaging so even the candy

729
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,910
bars come in a pill bottle right

730
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:20,309
essentially so it's not like they look

731
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:25,110
like what your kids eat or it can be

732
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:26,429
confused easily yeah so the article

733
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:27,839
wraps up to say this isn't the first

734
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,340
time people have gone to Oregon to buy

735
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,019
something either because it's cheaper or

736
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,889
because they don't apply sales tax he

737
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,980
said we

738
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,270
for liquor and we see it for tobacco so

739
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,849
they're making a ton of money in

740
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,259
Washington and they may have grown too

741
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,669
much cannabis which is fine because

742
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,500
they're pushing down the prices all

743
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,850
right all right I'm gonna do this one

744
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,039
more article this is also from

745
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,299
Washington I know guys I'm in Colorado

746
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,049
but I like to share the news from all

747
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,000
over the place

748
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:53,159
this one says Washington cracking down

749
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,539
on unlicensed medical marijuana stores

750
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,550
we don't even have to read the whole

751
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,009
article here because that headline says

752
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:01,230
it all this articles by Martha Belial

753
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,180
from The Associated Press and I hope I

754
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,220
said your last name bruh he said 15

755
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,650
unlicensed medical marijuana shops in

756
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,839
unincorporated King County are on notice

757
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,700
that they are violating the law gene

758
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,859
County prosecutor Dan Centerburg and

759
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,059
Sheriff John something said Wednesday

760
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,459
that they were cracking down on these

761
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,109
stores after Washington lawmakers

762
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,870
amended initiative 502 to require

763
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:23,309
licenses for all pot shops the change in

764
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:26,579
the law brought medical marijuana into

765
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:28,409
the state licensing and tax scheme satur

766
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,970
Berg said the stores were notified by

767
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,100
mail this week and if they continue to

768
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,839
operate as unlicensed retail outlets for

769
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:36,389
the black-market they'll face civil and

770
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,740
criminal ramifications so these shops

771
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,380
are not registered and they are

772
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,900
operating like medical marijuana

773
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,000
dispensaries it says the 15 stores that

774
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,550
received a notice include seven in the

775
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,750
white sinner neighborhood two in Skyway

776
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:50,369
and six in the eastern part of the

777
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,200
county messages left at Northwest

778
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,209
cannabis mark in Seattle and Military

779
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,580
Road holistic and Auburn were not

780
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,110
immediately returned there was no answer

781
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:00,689
at Pacific coast natural medicine in

782
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,859
Seattle or the solution Renton so these

783
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,029
people are not answering the phones

784
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,459
because they're scared shitless they're

785
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,899
gonna get raided probably they're taking

786
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,100
tax money from the state and operating

787
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,259
in locations that would never be

788
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,089
approved by the LCB he said they are

789
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,450
blight on the neighborhoods they inhibit

790
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,889
that's that's a matter of opinion he

791
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,539
said the federal government is washing

792
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,550
watching how Washington regulates the

793
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,079
marijuana industry and the success of

794
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,639
the law depends on how well local

795
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,500
jurisdictions deal with unlicensed

796
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,390
retail stores in addition to sending

797
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,250
notifications to the 15 stores County

798
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,780
officials have notified landlords that

799
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,670
there's an illegal business operating on

800
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,319
the property he said this means that if

801
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,150
the stores continue to operate illegally

802
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,730
the liquor and cannabis board can go in

803
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,990
and seize all of the product if the

804
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,029
civil options don't work they'll

805
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,589
consider criminal remedies he said we're

806
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:45,119
not going in heavy-handed on this he

807
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,039
said we're telling them

808
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:51,209
new scheme has to be followed the days

809
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,430
of the wild wild west are over so we saw

810
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,160
this kind of happen in Colorado this

811
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,870
it's totally still it just happened in

812
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,029
our city like three weeks ago there was

813
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:02,579
just some dude who was like I could do

814
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,170
this it just opened up a dispensary

815
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:05,549
essentially out of his house oh that

816
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,730
guy's been going on for a while that guy

817
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:10,440
also was accused of blasting buds making

818
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,420
BHO out of the buds and selling those

819
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,279
buds that he blasted back on the black

820
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:19,890
market right and got turned in by people

821
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,808
in the neighborhood or whatever so these

822
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,340
guys have storefronts with advertising

823
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:25,230
and they're advertising just like a

824
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,299
normal store and now they're gonna

825
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,640
either have to get raided I hope they

826
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,928
don't bring it to that because this is

827
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,360
what sucks you have a state that allows

828
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:35,610
you to do this and then people like this

829
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,129
don't follow the rules and they [ __ ] it

830
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,509
up for have to go in there and tell them

831
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,640
to shut this down and if they don't

832
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,079
they're gonna get raided bro right the

833
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,210
feds will come in and take all of their

834
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,879
[ __ ] like at this point in Colorado you

835
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,250
just google the rules and then follow

836
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,400
the path laid out and you can have your

837
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:56,220
marijuana store you just you just follow

838
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,559
the rules and do it or you can just put

839
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,480
a sign in your front yard and get

840
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,549
yourself a whiteboard and a couple of

841
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,440
jars and a cash register and go to town

842
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,240
on your living room away for the cops to

843
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,490
show up and they will show up and you'll

844
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,589
be charged with unlawful distribution of

845
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,589
