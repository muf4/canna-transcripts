you know i like to start this podcast

20
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,689
off by talking about what i'm smoking

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,850
today I've been taking dabs of George

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,789
Washington oh gee batter from my friends

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,730
at apothecary farms on the label it says

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,579
this product contains 66 point seven

25
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,858
percent THC and seventy nine point three

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,349
percent total cannabinoids I'm giving it

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,349
a fresh smell right now in my opinion

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,209
this smells like dank OG Kush with a

29
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,009
hint of health food store in the

30
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,599
background that may sound crazy to some

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,010
people but if you've ever walked into

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,169
that hippie health food store in your

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,509
neighborhood it's got that very specific

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,960
smell I think that George Washington has

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,879
the OG Kush plus health food store one

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,219
thing I can for sure mention is it has

37
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,349
given me tremendous cottonmouth every

38
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,629
time I'd add this I get [ __ ] wicked

39
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,059
heavy cottonmouth and I also get heavy

40
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,009
heavy eyes and nice and stoned I'm

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,290
really enjoying the George Washington Oh

73
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,310
of the business for the start of the

74
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,130
show before we get to the emails let's

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,300
do a quick garden update I like to

76
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:00,069
update you what's happening in the I

77
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,170
read genetics breeding garden quite

78
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,090
often if you've been following along you

79
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,250
know that I recently pollinated a bunch

80
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,409
of plants I'm sure you heard the episode

81
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,509
where I sounded like I just snorted a

82
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,250
bunch of pollen because I basically did

83
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:14,259
my face was filled with Paul and my eyes

84
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,969
were itching my nose is runny my throat

85
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:17,349
felt weird I was coated in pollen I had

86
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,389
to take several showers to get that

87
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,400
stuff off of me it was well worth it

88
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:25,000
because we have got a successfully

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,280
pollinated garden again I used the King

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,590
Solomon male to pollinate a bunch of my

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,719
favorite females to replenish and

92
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,340
restock a bunch of the popular I read

93
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,459
genetic stuff that moves very quickly

94
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,189
and I did make one or two more new

95
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,770
crosses in that room in that time period

96
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:43,959
I did put the Mac one cut I've got the

97
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,930
Mac one from Kappa later I put that in

98
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,930
the room I pollinated it it does appear

99
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,209
to have made several seeds i pollinated

100
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,810
the Mac and another run and it only made

101
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,729
very few seeds it does appear that I've

102
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,009
made more seed this time however I

103
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,829
cannot be certain until it is harvest

104
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:06,399
time so I'm fairly excited to have more

105
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,950
Mac one to arise seeds we will see how

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,349
that goes and I'm also excited for that

107
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,119
other secret cross that is in there that

108
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,909
has never been pollinated by King

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,889
Solomon before I've also acquired a new

110
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:19,569
grow space where I hung up two LED

111
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,819
lights big shout-out to my friend at

112
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:23,589
black sale for the two Canon LEDs I

113
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:25,719
don't have any plants to put under them

114
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,329
that grow space is not running just yet

115
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,220
but it's

116
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,459
soon as it is going I will give you guys

117
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,129
updates on my progress test running LED

118
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,500
lights I've been growing with HID lights

119
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,789
for the majority of my grow career I've

120
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,829
played with some T fives I've

121
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:41,930
experimented with mainly metal halides

122
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,538
and high pressure sodium I really prefer

123
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,610
the kavita's but I was given to Canon

124
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:48,818
LEDs and I feel like they are going to

125
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,030
work perfectly in a small grow

126
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,860
environment

127
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:53,538
I took the lights out of the box and I

128
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,240
plug them in and there are some of the

129
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:57,620
brightest lights I have ever seen I know

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,019
brightness isn't everything

131
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,180
but they made me squint and I spend a

132
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:04,399
lot of time around grow lights and I

133
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,439
noticed that they are ridiculously

134
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,508
bright so I will keep you updated I will

135
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,399
let you know how the pollinated room

136
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,199
goes I will let you know how the Mac won

137
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,968
pollination goes I'll let you know how

138
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,218
many seeds I get from that and I will

139
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:18,649
also let you know how I feel about the

140
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:19,519
LEDs once I started growing underneath

141
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,049
those lights

142
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,818

143

Thor for finding us through the DGC and

173
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,379
dude you are very welcome for all of the

174
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,718
content and knowledge I appreciate the

175
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,088
respect that goes on to say I need a

176
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:34,370
little help with my grow tent this is my

177
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:36,709
second grow and I'm growing in a four by

178
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,920
six tent I have a 4 inch carbon filter

179
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:42,290
and fan hooked up above my tent in

180
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,600
I also have a six-inch inline fan for

181
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,060
bringing air into the tent I have two

182
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,879
fans on the inside and my light is a

183
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,490
where is it a 400 watt spectrum king LED

184
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,139
temperatures stay around 82 I would get

185
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,590
that a little bit lower if you can

186
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,180
it says RH stays around 40% that will

187
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:01,009
work for part of your flower phase you

188
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,420
may want to work on VPD a little bit but

189
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,000
that's okay that's going to work for you

190
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,939
for now it says I am steadily trying to

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,370
upgrade as I go currently I'm looking

192
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,949
into RO filters because I'm having to go

193
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,280
fill up water jugs three times a week at

194
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,599
Walmart do you have any water

195
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,500
suggestions I know I have hard water

196
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,080
where I live

197
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,790
also does my tent sound efficient enough

198
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,550
what are some things I should start

199
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,680
looking into investing in eventually I'd

200
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,439
like to run co2 when I get everything

201
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,090
else dialed in I'm also using Fox farms

202
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,100
ocean forest soil with advanced

203
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,489
nutrients bottled nutrients do you have

204
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,900
any good recommendations on soil and

205
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,150
nutrients any information you can throw

206
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:43,399
at me will be greatly appreciated

207
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:44,509
thank you for all the badass content

208
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,049
keep it coming

209
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,550
cheers buddy from Thor Thor thank you

210
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,220
for the great message there are a lot of

211
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,960
great points we can go over here really

212
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,560
quickly let's address the first thing

213
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,209
the Fox Farm ocean forest soil will be

214
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,370
acceptable I would prefer cocoa in my

215
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,899
world I would add some amendments to

216
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,240
that cocoa some perlite and some

217
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,579
personal light but then you know that I

218
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,590
would recommend either veg bloom or new

219
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,479
millennium nutrients that's what I would

220
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,609
recommend I understand that you've

221
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,590
probably spent a whole lot of money on

222
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,300
those advanced nutrients bottles so when

223
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,909
those run out maybe consider replacing

224
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,910
those with some new millennium products

225
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,770
maybe work your way toward using the veg

226
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,290
bloom line of powdered nutrients or

227
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:30,049
maybe listen to my mix episode and use

228
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,720
the combination that I've suggested now

229
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,519
most of your tent setup makes sense I'm

230
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,920
not sure how much light you're getting

231
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,240
from that 400 watt spectrum King I don't

232
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,769
know if that's enough light for that

233
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,019
space I would read what the

234
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,389
manufacturer's suggested on that I would

235
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,100
research the ppfd of that light but if

236
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:48,529
the light is sufficient it sounds like

237
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,330
most of your room makes sense the part

238
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,220
that does stand out to me as you say

239
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,829
you've got a 4 inch

240
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,050
and a carbon filter removing air from

241
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:59,388
the tent however you have got a six-inch

242
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:02,419
fan pushing air into the tent

243
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:05,028
what could possibly potentially happen

244
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:07,009
is you may be moving more air into that

245
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:09,889
tent than you are pulling out of the

246
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:12,500
tent which is going to make the air come

247
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:14,209
from the cracks and gaps in that tent

248
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,068
where the zipper is where the seams are

249
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,349
you're going to get air escaping from

250
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:20,599
the tent that air will not pass through

251
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,300
the carbon filter and it will be

252
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,639
odoriferous it will smell like ganja it

253
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:27,588
will smell like your plants so if I

254
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,350
understand this correctly you have got a

255
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:33,170
four inch fan removing air and a six

256
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,709
inch fan pushing air in I would swap

257
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:39,769
those or simply turn off the six inch

258
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:43,278
fan if that four inch fan is actually

259
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:45,828
exhausting air from the tent it will

260
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,629
create enough displacement of air and it

261
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:49,849
will bring fresh air in through that

262
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:53,028
hole where you've got your six inch fan

263
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,709
blowing air in as much air goes out will

264
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:57,948
have to be brought in and it will happen

265
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:59,659
naturally by air displacement so that is

266
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:01,519
the main thing that stood out when you

267
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:03,828
described your grow to me is that you

268
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,899
are pushing more air in than you are

269
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:08,120
pulling out that will give you a balloon

270
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:09,559
type environment in your tent your tent

271
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,448
will swell up and then what will happen

272
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,698
is that air will escape through the

273
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:15,469
zipper through the seams through all of

274
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:17,299
the other ports you've got other ports

275
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,980
for other ducting you've got other flaps

276
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,688
you're gonna swell it up and air is

277
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,220
going to come out of there I would

278
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:24,198
rather see negative pressure I would

279
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,910
rather see all of the air being sucked

280
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:27,859
through the carbon filter and then up

281
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:29,838
and out toward the walls of the tent

282
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,759
kind of cave in a little bit that way I

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,649
know that all of the air that is passing

284
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,329
out of that tent has gone through my

285
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,429
carbon filter and nobody is going to

286
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:39,620
smell my plants that is the main thing

287
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,269
that stands out to me now let's get to

288
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,310
the main part of your question you were

289
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,049
asking about RO filters because you've

290
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,268
been driving to Wal Mart to fill water

291
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:49,429
jugs three times a week and I'm sure

292
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,959
that is getting tiresome I'm sure that

293
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,388
is not convenient and I'm sure it's

294
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,068
starting to look a little bit suspicious

295
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,568
so let's figure out a way to keep you

296
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,549
out of Walmart three times a week

297
00:10:56,568 --> 00:11:00,259
filling up those jugs looking like

298
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:03,109
you've probably got to grow some where

299
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,299
you say you have got hard water in your

300
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,750
location have you tested the water have

301
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,729
you

302
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,679
looked at the municipal water support

303
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,269
from your water company in your area

304
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,149
they will tell you everything that is in

305
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,399
that water have you taken a ppm meter or

306
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,169
an EC meter and stuck it in your water

307
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,909
after it comes out of the tap to see

308
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,110
what is in there it's not going to tell

309
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:23,269
you what's in there but it will tell you

310
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,310
how much is in there have you checked

311
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,649
the pH of that water I'm very curious

312
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:30,469
what is coming out of your tap what I

313
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:34,009
have discovered in most cases if the

314
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,250
water is consumable by most people the

315
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:39,980
water should be okay for your grow room

316
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,230
now I do understand and I agree that we

317
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,539
do like to have a lot of control over

318
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,340
what goes into our plants and having

319
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,709
control over the water is a big

320
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,050
advantage if you would like to go with

321
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,810
an RO system for your home that is a

322
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:57,109
great idea it does create a little bit

323
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:59,179
of waste technology for RO machines has

324
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,639
come a long way and the amount of waste

325
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:03,319
has greatly been reduced compared to

326
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,949
what it used to be when we were first

327
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,590
using RO and our grows ro is a great way

328
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,600
to ensure you have got clean neutral

329
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,360
water it's also a great way to know

330
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,730
exactly what is going into your nutrient

331
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,370
mix it does however make it a little

332
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,610
more challenging to stabilize the pH of

333
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:25,190
your nutrient solution I also think that

334
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:28,610
an RO system is probably overkill in

335
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,530
most home grow environments if you were

336
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,279
growing hydroponically or if you were

337
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:37,220
growing in cocoa I may consider ro in a

338
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,049
home grow in most environments I think

339
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,500
if you really want to filter your water

340
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:45,079
a big-boy filter will be sufficient for

341
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,750
you it does not create a lot of waste it

342
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,850
does filter in a timely manner that ro

343
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,409
machine will take a very long time to

344
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,960
clean the amount of water you need I

345
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:56,149
think a big-boy filter or a small boy

346
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,030
filter will efficiently and effectively

347
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,189
clean your water for your grow you were

348
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,949
in a soilless mix environment you're

349
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,080
using Fox farms ocean forest soil so you

350
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,210
do have a buffer zone being in that

351
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,150
soilless mix allows you a little bit

352
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:14,000
more room so if you were in hydroponics

353
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,610
or cocoa I may consider recommending the

354
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,809
RO machine for you but I really believe

355
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,430
that in most cases that big boy that's

356
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:24,639
boy filter will filter the water

357
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:26,649
probably more than efficiently for what

358
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,199
you're trying to do in your home grow I

359
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,970
set up big-boy filters in most of my

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,070
commercial environments because I find

361
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,960
that the RO water is more wasteful than

362
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,360
anything and I think that the big-boy

363
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,790
filters they're quicker and they clean

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,490
more than what we need and it doesn't

365
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:44,709
create that excessive wastewater which I

366
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,419
find to be beneficial we still pay for

367
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,100
that water even though it gets sent out

368
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,959
as waste water it came through the line

369
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,278
we've got to pay for it even though we

370
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,860
cleaned it flush it down the toilet

371
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,080
basically so I do think that a big-boy

372
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,839
filter or a small boy filter would work

373
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,550
efficiently for your grow it's much more

374
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,080
affordable to buy it it's much more

375
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,179
affordable to set it up and you're not

376
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,009
going to waste nearly as much water and

377
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,629
I do believe that it will clean the

378
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,610
water perfectly for you

379
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:11,528
now the next detail you mentioned is

380
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,080
that you would like to run co2 once you

381
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:15,700
get everything else dialed in that is

382
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,020
going to be one of the last things that

383
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,120
you're going to add I would make sure

384
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,829
that you get all of your grow technique

385
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
dialed in I would make sure that you get

386
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,920
the appropriate light make sure you've

387
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,139
got enough light in there again I don't

388
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,088
know if that 400 watt LED is enough

389
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,399
light it could be that's you've got to

390
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,770
do the research on that one I get your

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,629
water dialed in get your nutrients

392
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,069
dialed in get your genetics dialed in

393
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,320
and then once you're ready for co2

394
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,570
you've got to think about you are now

395
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,370
ducting all of the air right out of that

396
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,990
tent continuously because we're trying

397
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,940
not to get humidity problems we're

398
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,129
trying not to get stagnant air try not

399
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,770
to get temperature problems in there so

400
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,600
if you're going to introduce co2 how are

401
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,730
you going to keep the co2 flowing

402
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,409
through that tent without wasting it

403
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,230
you're going to have to seal up the room

404
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:01,389
in which the tent is in and then co2 the

405
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,399
room and then pump the co2 in and out of

406
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,919
that tent continuously is what I think

407
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,208
you'll probably have to do another thing

408
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,159
I will recommend is that you add some

409
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,809
sort of a monitor so that you can pay

410
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:14,500
better attention to your temperature and

411
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:16,269
humidity 82 is kind of high if you're in

412
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,889
North America it is the winter which

413
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,829
means when the summer comes you're going

414
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,569
to get 5 to 10 degrees hotter in that

415
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,670
grow environment so let's get prepared

416
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,709
now let's start working on cooling that

417
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:27,939
room so we don't roast those plants

418
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,649
you're going to want to pay more

419
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,560
attention to the temperature and the

420
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,698
humidity that 40% relative humidity is

421
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,099
acceptable

422
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:37,688
most cases but throughout flower

423
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,489
throughout veg throughout different

424
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:41,980
parts of the cycle you may want higher

425
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:44,319
you may want lower so you may want a

426
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,230
monitor and the appropriate equipment to

427
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:49,539
adjust those parameters when they are

428
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,100
needed a lot of people set up a grow

429
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:52,568
room and they think cool this is set up

430
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,489
I'm going to survive through the grow

431
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:56,558
let's get it going and then they forget

432
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,290
that if you live somewhere like Colorado

433
00:15:56,558 --> 00:16:01,659
and the summer where I live it gets 110

434
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:04,208
112 degrees then in the winter it gets

435
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:06,668
12 degrees so I've got to set up

436
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,618
different setups for different times of

437
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:10,269
the year and right now we are entering

438
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:12,699
the time of the year where I've got to

439
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,308
start preparing for the warm season yes

440
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:17,139
it is March right now as April creeps in

441
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,149
we'll get one or two last snowstorms

442
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:21,339
then when those snowstorms go away it'll

443
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,828
start getting real warm and then kapowie

444
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,449
it gets super hot for a while then it

445
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:27,789
will get super humid because we get a

446
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:29,858
lot of rain and then after all that rain

447
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:31,868
we get a bunch of snow and it will be

448
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:34,179
cold as [ __ ] again for four or five

449
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:35,709
maybe six months so I am prepared for

450
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:38,139
that because I've been doing this for so

451
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:40,088
long I can predict it I can see I watch

452
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,769
outside I watch the sky pay attention to

453
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:44,079
the weather I know when it's coming I

454
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,869
know how to adjust I've got to adjust a

455
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,698
lot of things for seasonal grows here in

456
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:50,649
Colorado but I've been doing it for a

457
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:51,818
while so I can foresee it I'm kind of I

458
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,168
can predict that [ __ ]

459
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:55,479
I've kind of got routines and rhythms

460
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:57,458
and I know exactly what to do when the

461
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,019
winter and when the summer come so

462
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,278
everybody should keep that in mind when

463
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,928
they are setting up their grows if

464
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,088
you're building a tent it may be the

465
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:05,918
perfect environment in there now what

466
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:08,078
happens in six months when the seasons

467
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,250
are the complete opposite alright my

468
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,888
friend I think I answered your question

469
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,538
more than sufficiently hey Thor thank

470
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:15,908
you for the great message if you've got

471
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:18,338
any follow-up questions please reach out

472
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,990
I would love to hear from you alright

473
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,448
I've got one more email in front of me

474
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,370
let's jump right to it it goes just like

475
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,339
this it says hi I've been listening to

476
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,259
your podcast great content and quality

477
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,089
I've got a couple of questions for you

478
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:32,500
hey first of all thank you for starting

479
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,158
off with compliments I do appreciate

480
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,558
that

481
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:37,389
the questions go like this I've been

482
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,980
playing around with soil builds and the

483
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:41,259
sense that I'll do a run with the same

484
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,179
beans and grow them out and soils that I

485
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:45,878
build using different quantities of

486
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:47,410
amendments I let the soil cook off so

487
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,789
it's not too hot and

488
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,519
it's stable enough for the plants to

489
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:53,619
express themselves as they see fit this

490
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,539
is a great idea this is the idea behind

491
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:57,969
building a super soil or maybe like a

492
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:00,309
no-till type of environment this person

493
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,049
is creating a soil they're getting all

494
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,899
of the appropriate amendments together

495
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,430
they're putting it in a soil they've got

496
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,110
I don't know what their sources are we

497
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,850
haven't gotten that far but they've got

498
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:11,319
a source of nitrogen a source of

499
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:13,480
phosphorous a source of potassium

500
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,669
they've got all the macro all the

501
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,799
micronutrients in here from natural

502
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,080
organic sources they put it in a

503
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,059
container the soil does what we call

504
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,159
cook for a period of time which breaks

505
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,589
down all of those amendments and makes

506
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,170
them bioavailable to the plant then we

507
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,849
put the plants in this soil and we don't

508
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,800
have to feed them all we have to do is

509
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:35,259
water them because everything is in the

510
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,230
soil naturally and they eat at their own

511
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,970
will this listener believes that this

512
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,160
will allow the plants to express

513
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,380
themselves as they see fit because we

514
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,320
are not forced feeding them chelated

515
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,690
buffered nutrients this is a very common

516
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,609
and very realistic approach to cannabis

517
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,150
growing and I cannot wait to get further

518
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,469
into this question it goes on to say

519
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,090
indulging in this practice has made me

520
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,240
aware of something which brings me to my

521
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:03,399
question different soil compositions

522
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,039
create what seem like different terpene

523
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,100
profiles in the same plants grown in

524
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,369
them if this observation is true then my

525
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:14,319
question is this how does one find the

526
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:16,750
plant's truest expression with today's

527
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,759
plants that have such varied genetic

528
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,809
backgrounds because if extensive

529
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,599
crossbreeding

530
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:25,829
and breeding and back crossing building

531
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:29,379
a soil of its origin seems imposing and

532
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:31,059
impossible that my friend is the magic

533
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,100
question that is what we are all

534
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,700
searching for that is the cannabis

535
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:39,189
growers never-ending quest what you were

536
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,009
talking about is what I call dialing it

537
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,670
and we want to dial in you want to dial

538
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:47,349
in your soil mix so that that plant

539
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,779
represents itself and expresses itself

540
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:52,209
to its fullest potential that is the

541
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:54,099
biggest goal for a cannabis grower once

542
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,380
you are good at getting all the basics

543
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,169
down that is where your brain goes how

544
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,250
do I get this plant to be the best plant

545
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,870
it can be that is how we get

546
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,730
up winning cannabis that is how we get

547
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:08,029
award-winning cannabis that is how we

548
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,610
get very helpful medicine people with

549
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:13,190
passion like yourself that my friend is

550
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:15,649
the never-ending quest is to get that

551
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,940
plant dialed in to perfection I'm gonna

552
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,200
continue with more of the email than I

553
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,670
really want to talk about this but

554
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,630
there's more but I want to cover before

555
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,390
I get going

556
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,640
building a soil of its origin seems

557
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,590
imposing and impossible yes with all the

558
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,900
crossbreeding you can get a plant that's

559
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:31,730
got Afghani and Thai and Mexican

560
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,290
genetics in it and how do I know what

561
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,390
kind of soil to put that in because it's

562
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:37,279
not from Mexico it's not from an Afghan

563
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,020
region it's not from Thailand I can't

564
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,819
build that soil here how do I know what

565
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,619
to put in there and then if I do get

566
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,599
that right how do I even know that the

567
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:46,159
phenotype I put in there is going to

568
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:49,189
like that mix that is a very good

569
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,110
question it goes on to say every grow I

570
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,420
wonder what the plants could have

571
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,250
expressed it's a deep rabbit hole I'm

572
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,480
not sure what's on the other end yes

573
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,609
that's why I want to cover all this

574
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,410
before I get rambly another question

575
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,629
maybe you could dispel some of the myths

576
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,980
surrounding long-term storage of beans

577
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,200
all right let's not even unpack that

578
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,500
part let's talk about the part about

579
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,390
dialing in your soil you are absolutely

580
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,640
correct in thinking that different

581
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,320
amendments will absolutely give us

582
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,990
different colors different aromas

583
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:20,179
different flavors different terpene

584
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,970
profiles different cannabinoid profiles

585
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,490
it can make very many different

586
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,370
variables in the final outcome of our

587
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,160
plants also everything above the soil

588
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:33,559
will have a similar or different effect

589
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,750
the lights may change how your plants

590
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,000
grow I breed seeds I've got the

591
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,730
opportunity to see my seeds grown under

592
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,500
LEDs I get to see them under HBS I get

593
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,990
to see them under ceramic metal halides

594
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,119
I get to see them under makeshift ghetto

595
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,940
grows and I get to see how those plants

596
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,829
express themselves and I do see

597
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,960
variation from all of those lights so

598
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:55,399
not only is the soil and the medium

599
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,769
going to make a difference but the

600
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,050
lights will make a difference also your

601
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,700
VPD and overall environment will make a

602
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,349
difference are you a little dryer in

603
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,210
your grow room is your grow room a

604
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:07,309
little more humid or a little warmer all

605
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,590
of those things are going to make a

606
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,230
difference in how this plant expresses

607
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,909
itself it sounds to me like you are at

608
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,980
the stage of the game where you want to

609
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,259
find how to make

610
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,450
this plant express itself perfectly with

611
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:21,490
your soil mix which is a beautiful goal

612
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,890
you want to whip up a batch of soil and

613
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,750
say bad is the magic mix right there my

614
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,730
plant is going to do everything it needs

615
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,730
to do it just the right time it's going

616
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:33,130
to be top shelf a grade Cup winning

617
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,048
magical medical marijuana that's what

618
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,440
you're looking for and I admire you for

619
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:38,440
that

620
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,390
here is the way that I feel like we get

621
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,539
to that you did state that you were

622
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,210
growing from seed I like that but we've

623
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,889
got to grow from clone of course

624
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,950
start with your favorite batch of seeds

625
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,929
let's do a basic Fino hunt then let's

626
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,298
narrow it down to one phenotype that

627
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,160
works beautifully well for you the one

628
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:59,650
that is your favorite out of that pack

629
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,390
of seeds you choose what you like you

630
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,210
take what works best for you and your

631
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,340
grow in your pipe in your life choose

632
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,319
the phenotype that is your favorite now

633
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,889
we are going to develop a relationship

634
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:14,589
with that plant and that soil the only

635
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,860
way we can create any sort of scientific

636
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:20,678
outcome is by doing very scientific

637
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,019
practices let's take six clones of the

638
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,570
same plant and put them all in different

639
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:27,789
soil and see how they react all those

640
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:30,339
six different plants let's document very

641
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:33,250
well what's in pot a what's in pot B if

642
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:36,548
we eliminate variables it makes it much

643
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,950
easier to dial in to perfection so by

644
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:41,470
eliminating the variable of different

645
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:44,200
plants in the room that now allows us to

646
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,289
dial in the soil because I hate to break

647
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:51,548
it to you no two plants are going to be

648
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:53,889
completely happy in the same soil mix we

649
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:55,359
like to dream that we can whip up some

650
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,150
magic soil that's going to work for

651
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:00,490
everything I do not believe that that is

652
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,960
going to be accurate I say that having

653
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,789
cannabis plants is like having

654
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,470
girlfriends you have got to learn all of

655
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,418
their little quirks all of their little

656
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,279
niches you've got to learn all of the

657
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,929
details that make them happy you've also

658
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,509
got to learn all of the details that

659
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,980
piss them off you've got to avoid all of

660
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:17,079
those things that piss them off and

661
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,179
you've got to amplify all the things

662
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,009
that make them happy unless you've got a

663
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:22,660
spreadsheet and a notebook and a couple

664
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:24,759
of friends helping you out it is very

665
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,529
hard to dial in more than one girlfriend

666
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,419
you are not going to keep her happy

667
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,638
you've got to focus and figure out

668
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:33,038
what she needs and do that [ __ ] your

669
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:35,678
cannabis garden is very similar let's

670
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,169
learn one plant develop a relationship

671
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,659
with it see what it likes you can't do

672
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,570
this with one grow you may need four

673
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:46,210
five six maybe ten or twenty grows with

674
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:48,189
the same plant to dial it to perfection

675
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,308
and it sounds like that is your goal is

676
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,200
to get a plant to express itself to its

677
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:55,989
full potential which would be a perfect

678
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,749
grow so again my recommendation is

679
00:24:55,989 --> 00:25:01,210
finding one clone it works beautifully

680
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:03,579
for you find one environment that you're

681
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,798
going to do this experiment in then mix

682
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:07,449
up four or five different types of soil

683
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:09,489
however many pots you can put in that

684
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,769
room to flower mix up that many

685
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:15,819
different types of soil take very good

686
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:17,440
notes again label pot a pot b or pot one

687
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:20,048
through six however you want to do it

688
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,970
then mark down what was in each pot very

689
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:24,730
carefully I put this in here I put this

690
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,249
in here then grow your plants all in the

691
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,440
same environment so it is scientific the

692
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:32,259
only acceptable variable in this

693
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,149
experiment is the soil that is the only

694
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:36,730
thing that should change do not change

695
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:38,709
lights do not change pot sizes do not

696
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,839
change frequency of watering do

697
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,058
everything the same don't top one plant

698
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,308
don't Wally pop one if you do something

699
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:48,339
to one plant do it to every plant in the

700
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:50,378
room treat them all equally then pay

701
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,988
close attention to the plants take a lot

702
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:55,658
a lot of notes take excessive notes take

703
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:57,489
excessive photos if you can then use

704
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:59,139
your grower intuition and your grower

705
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:02,288
knowledge and grower skills to determine

706
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:04,628
which soil is working best for your

707
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:07,898
plant now this is where the fun part

708
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:10,238
comes in when you dry cure harvest smoke

709
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:12,608
those plants you and I may completely

710
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:14,619
disagree on which one was better that is

711
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,569
the magic of cannabis you may get that

712
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:18,579
soil perfect and you may smoke it you'll

713
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:20,829
say that's exactly what I was going for

714
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,928
and then I'm a smoke sample be that you

715
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:25,358
reject it I'll go that's exactly what I

716
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:27,220
would have bought so it is a frustrating

717
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:29,470
struggle but it is a fun struggle

718
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,629
perfection is all up to you what is your

719
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,038
goal what are you trying to do I know

720
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:35,469
you're trying to get this plant to

721
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,808
express itself to its fullest potential

722
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,940
you want the most Terps you want the

723
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:41,990
most potency you want the most colors

724
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,519
you want the most flavors and aromas you

725
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,038
the best buzz who want the best

726
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,139
photography and I admire that but keep

727
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,898
in mind that best is a very relative

728
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,120
word so my opinion of best your opinion

729
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:54,949
of best could be different as long as

730
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,658
you reach your goal that is what matters

731
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,880
so my friend you were going to have to

732
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,730
mix up a bunch of batches of soil and I

733
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,220
recommend running the same clone over

734
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,019
and over in that soil take a lot of

735
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,240
notes get very familiar with the soil

736
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,950
get very familiar with that plant then

737
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,990
once you have got that plant and that

738
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,759
soil dialed in that's when I would

739
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,950
recommend putting some other clones in

740
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,390
that mix and see how they react and see

741
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,490
if that makes is perfect for those

742
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,679
plants as well then see how you need to

743
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,329
adjust that mix then we can start doing

744
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,059
some science and find out the happy

745
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:28,250
medium then maybe you can have the magic

746
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:30,408
soil in the future but honestly I think

747
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,630
it is going to be different soil for

748
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:35,570
every plant and for every single

749
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,309
phenotype but don't feel alone my friend

750
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:40,158
because you are on the quest that every

751
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:42,319
advanced grower reaches we want to find

752
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,990
out how to make those plants express

753
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,298
their truest potential and I admire you

754
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,579
for going down that path it is a rabbit

755
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:51,679
hole keep taking notes and don't let

756
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:53,418
yourself become a mad scientist I think

757
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,278
you're on a great path alright there is

758
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,049
more to this message it says another

759
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,750
question maybe you could dispel some of

760
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:00,889
the myths surrounding long-term storage

761
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,659
of beans

762
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,549
I've always back packed mine and kept

763
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,559
them in an airtight waterproof case in

764
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:08,898
the fridge it seems to work but I do

765
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,658
notice older seeds become less viable

766
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:13,969
less vigorous and growth anyway as a

767
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,880
breeder how would you store your beans

768
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,679
for long periods of time I really do

769
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,559
like your podcasts love to pop up some

770
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,019
of your beans someday when time allows

771
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,418
thanks from either hey this is a great

772
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:30,740
message thank you let's talk briefly

773
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:33,590
about seed storage a big factor in how I

774
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,750
decide to store my seeds is how long I

775
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,879
intend to keep those seeds in storage

776
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,069
and if I plan to remove them and show

777
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,620
them to friends or anything like that in

778
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:45,349
most cases I prefer to keep them in a

779
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,569
cool dry dark environment that is the

780
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,788
main thing cool dry and dark we want

781
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:51,200
them dark we want them cool heat will

782
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:52,970
kind of deactivate them and kill them

783
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,069
heat is not good for anything it

784
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,700
degrades just about everything cool will

785
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,888
kind of keep

786
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,538
in that suspended animation state keep

787
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:01,548
things alive we keep things in

788
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,528
preservation in a cooler I don't

789
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:06,589
recommend a freezer although some people

790
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:09,558
do do that dry absolutely keep your

791
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:11,509
seeds dry any moisture will cause them

792
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,788
to germinate so let's talk about storage

793
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:16,308
and why I don't like to put some seeds

794
00:29:13,788 --> 00:29:18,528
in the refrigerator or in containers in

795
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:21,408
the fridge if you are going to remove

796
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:24,349
your seeds from your cold storage

797
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:27,019
frequently I do not like to put them in

798
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,490
the fridge just put them in the safe put

799
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,109
them on a shelf in the basement where it

800
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,058
stays consistently cool and it never

801
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:34,069
gets too hot something like that will be

802
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:35,329
sufficient if you were the kind of

803
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:37,250
person that wants to show your

804
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:40,220
collection off to your friends the

805
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:43,099
reason I say this is every time you move

806
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,200
your seeds from cold storage you are

807
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:47,359
changing the temperature of the seed the

808
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,120
packaging and the environment inside of

809
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,219
that packaging and you do increase the

810
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,069
risk and opportunity of some type of

811
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,048
condensation or moisture making contact

812
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:58,460
with your seeds why would we want to

813
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,058
change the temperature once you've got

814
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,470
them cool

815
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:02,210
they think they're stored they think

816
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,528
they're in the snow they think they fell

817
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,788
out of a plant they're sitting in the

818
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:06,888
snow they're waiting for spring to come

819
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:09,169
to germinate let's not take them out and

820
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:11,269
keep teasing them I also said I don't

821
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:14,000
prefer to freeze seeds I don't find that

822
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:16,669
necessary there are places that do

823
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,970
freeze the seeds I don't do it I like to

824
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:22,610
keep them in a sealed container that is

825
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,350
airtight and I keep that in a brown

826
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:26,599
paper bag in the bottom of a

827
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:28,250
refrigerator in the crisper drawer if I

828
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,158
intend to keep those seeds for a very

829
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,950
long time now you said as a breeder how

830
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,620
do I store my seeds fortunately my seeds

831
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,659
do not stick around very long so they

832
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:41,089
are produced they are packaged up and

833
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,809
they basically go to vendors and they

834
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,509
are gone

835
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:46,490
my personal seeds are kept in jars which

836
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,308
are kept sealed airtight which are kept

837
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,929
in a safe which is in a very cool area

838
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:53,058
of the house that's in a basement in a

839
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:55,309
very back corner that section is always

840
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:57,648
dark and cool back there so I trust that

841
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:59,720
those seeds will be safe stored like

842
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,609
that for quite a while I've been able to

843
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,278
germinate seeds that have been stored in

844
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,709
that safe for five to ten years and they

845
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:09,579
come out very successfully yes you are

846
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,590
accurate in the idea that some

847
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,659
they get older will become less viable

848
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:16,059
and less vigorous that is just how

849
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,100
nature goes over time those things will

850
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,779
start to degrade but if you've got a

851
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:21,339
large quantity you should be able to

852
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:24,250
germinate some out of those packs

853
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,569
another thing is I don't vacuum seal my

854
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,490
and I just feel like that's unnecessary

855
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:29,799
I feel like it kind of crushes them I

856
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,599
just put them in a sealed container I

857
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:33,700
make sure that no moisture can get to

858
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,799
them and then I put them again in the

859
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,330
back of the fridge in the dark or in

860
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:42,069
that safe which is in a cool dark dry

861
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,779
location I barely ever open that safe

862
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,639
unless I need to get seeds out of there

863
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,680
I get what I need and I put them back

864
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,570
and I don't handle the seeds more than

865
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,210
necessary I also recommend if you're

866
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:54,429
going to handle the naked seed itself

867
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,140
without packaging wear gloves you don't

868
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,090
want to get your sweat your skin oils

869
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,040
and crap on the seeds especially if

870
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:02,709
those are going out for retail please

871
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:04,690
wear gloves now as a seed breeder I do

872
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,970
appreciate that people are buying seeds

873
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,789
and storing them but what I would really

874
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:13,450
recommend is that you grow them the best

875
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:15,940
place for a seed is in some dirt so get

876
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,890
those seeds go in a my new friend Iser I

877
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,779
hope I covered your question I'm pretty

878
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,490
sure I went real deep on your soil

879
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:24,549
question I hope I covered your seed

880
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,710
storage question basically keep them dry

881
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:28,779
dark and cool don't let any moisture get

882
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,519
to them and your seeds should store for

883
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,649
a very long time if you do put them in

884
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,269
the freezer or the refrigerator leave

885
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,830
them there quit bringing them out to

886
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,480
show your friends if you want to show

887
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,970
your friends just keep them in a safe

888
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,799
keep them in a dry airtight Tupperware

889
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,569
container and I think you'll be okay

890
