episode you guys might not be aware that

75
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,989
I am a co-host of a podcast called seven

76
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,450
one nine the blocks and one night me and

77
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,980
my bro that host that with me we were

78
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:17,989
out at a hookah bar and we met a cat

79
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:19,639
named Gary later he messaged us saying

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,360
he wanted to be on the show and talk

81
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,769
about weed

82
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,200
well Gary didn't know that I've got a

83
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,850
weed podcast so he brought him on seven

84
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,699
one nine the blocks with intentions to

85
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:31,370
record seven one nine the blocks and use

86
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:32,780
parts of that for this show so what I

87
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,659
did was cut out the parts I found

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:56,840
valuable for you guys and this is what I

89
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:58,789
got for my friend Gary okay so what I

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,379
thought and for listeners I just didn't

91
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,209
record because I wanted to get what he

92
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,400
was saying we're doing the blocks

93
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,780
podcast and the iGrow culture podcast at

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,330
the same time we're gonna do a dual

95
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,590
episode we're gonna record this way it's

96
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,640
getting himself a cup of coffee and then

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,620
he'll be right here to do the intro

98
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,569
right here but we're gonna record this

99
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:20,980

108
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:41,479
some sort of different educated opinion

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,220
to combat whatever the public chieftain

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,080
says achieved in and then to even if you

111
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,169
don't like growing weed I'm pretty sure

112
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,389
what jeff has to say about growing

113
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:54,740
period probably applies like you know we

114
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,729
haven't even talked much about growing

115
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,530
yet I'm trying to put the audience

116
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,530
before we start the gross no [ __ ]

117
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,689
episode was about edibles oh yeah there

118
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,930
was a big report that the edibles

119
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:13,439
weren't containing what dose of th he's

120
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:19,509
the guy he's a photographer the pole

121
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:21,160
he's got a red card no idea - we

122
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,990
featured a phone interview with Addison

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,720
tomorrow from steep hill labs discussing

124
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,759
who is he's the steep hill labs is the

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,890
industry leader in medical marijuana

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:36,839
testing facilities they test your

127
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:36,839
cannabis for THC CBD [ __ ] coffee

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:51,400
talking about residual solvents left in

129
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:54,819
hash just goings on and of course we try

130
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,649
to dispel myths and that's muy

131
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:58,959
importante just because it's another

132
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,879
information source for people even if

133
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,009
you don't agree with marijuana there's

134
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,589
still another information source so I

135
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,689
don't agree with the Bush presidency so

136
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,969
I agree with everything he said so I

137
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,620
watch YouTube okay and there's a lot of

138
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,450
information on YouTube about George Bush

139
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,040
you get to watch him turn into a reptile

140
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:20,379
yup all right do the little intro

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,569

00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:28,059
sound distracted on the show often yeah

206
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,948
I grabbed the microphone on Comedy Works

207
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,750
and I talked into it and I don't think

208
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,818
it's on because the sound is that

209
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,159
perfect it was perfect in the perfect

210
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:42,338

00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,230
not the set but just the the set up I

216
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,740
should say is that the stage it is so

217
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,420
personal that audience is right there

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,649

219

rows everyone's very involved they are

220
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,938
right on top of you and you get the

221
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,750
looks of if you're bombing at all you

Colorado and define this statement

301
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:12,929
essentially well gosh weird of like a UH

302
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:14,789
like significant economic genesis here

303
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,949
right with the legalization of marijuana

304
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:20,849
they just reported today the revenues

305
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,980
were up revenues were up again Friday

306
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,870
Eric Holder the US Attorney General

307
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,250
announced publicly that he wanted to

308
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,179
work with Congress to reschedule

309
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:33,230
marijuana

310
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:35,939
what do you mean reschedule Gary let's

311
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,990
take it to from where it's being treated

312
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,620
as you know um like heroin now treated

313
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,889
more like nicotine or alcohol reclassify

314
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,159
the caliber of drug it is which i think

315
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:51,840
is legit well that that's legal I think

316
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,429
changing it is legit I don't think the

317
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,030
current is legit I think changing and

318
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,189
it's a way to go

319
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,769
yeah and that's that's gonna be you know

320
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,170
that's legalization effectively you know

321
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,990
it well-regulated of course a highly

322
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:10,339
taxed of course of course but just like

323
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:14,820
Alcohol Tobacco leo obtainable okay so

324
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:17,780
if that does happen do you feel an

325
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,190
onslaught coming do we feel that

326
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,909
Colorado is going to be under a

327
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,560
microscope even more probably less yeah

328
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,289
nationwide there begin

329
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,789
well more places to stare at some

330
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,439
indication that it could be a global

331
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:32,000
thing

332
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,089
if you really follow there's you know

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,250
Uruguay legalized right you have $1

334
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,720
grand at the time that they legalized

335
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,850
which is somebody what's six seven

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,579
months ago they were criticized by the

337
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,740
UN still are being criticized by well

338
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:47,179
the UN's changed this position now on

339
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,490
drugs in general saying that

340
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,399
criminalization is not effective and

341
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,799
there now this was official as of like

342
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,500
the beginning of the month that they're

343
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,789
officially changing their position that

344
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,278
criminalization of drugs is detrimental

345
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:02,659
to the population and they they're

346
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,528
advising against it now

347
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:08,528
so do you think the government's just

348
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:10,490
try to get a jump in unlike the the

349
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:11,870
process the money that they're missing

350
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,220
because they're getting the weed but I

351
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,078
mean if they want their sticky fingers

352
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,310
and sticky fingers well another

353
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:21,919
significant indicator and just a

354
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,778
delicious bit of irony is that the

355
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:28,969
government got a jump on everybody by

356
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:30,828
patenting in 1999 cannabinoids wait well

357
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,610
staff wasn't aware I didn't heard about

358
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:33,649
it but I didn't know what actually

359
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,889
happened yeah the US Department of

360
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:39,049
Health holds the patent medical patent

361
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:44,778
on cannabinoids and you can look it up

362
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:46,818
numbers it was valuable and useful and

363
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:49,519
medicinal yeah and you can also say that

364
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:56,568
this is this movement of legalization is

365
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:58,278
probably pre-planned once it was legal

366
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,778
everything just fell right into place so

367
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,838
quickly that I wouldn't doubt that one

368
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:04,609
bit so okay we're not gonna [ __ ] move

369
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,068
on from this no you guys are just

370
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:11,000
throwing some [ __ ] assumptions out

371
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:12,470
there without some details guys it seems

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,519
like I don't have any details but it

373
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,919
looks like everything fell into place

374
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,318
perfectly from my view like you talk

375
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,650
about the things that are coming what do

376
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,759
you call it

377
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,288
Pueblo Springs Ranch correct dude that

378
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,720
happened like the day after they

379
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:35,000
announced oh yeah those ranch was

380
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:37,159
supposed to be going up 2008 just boom

381
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,690
everything went right away like okay and

382
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,470
it was just like this the troops were

383
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,380
lined up talking about since January

384
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,500
first or since MMJ January first okay

385
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,900
yeah mm Jay was a good start so what the

386
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,079
fight what the [ __ ] is the fight for

387
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,730
then from like city city council and

388
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,349
[ __ ] like that like do you feel City

389
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,558
Council for the most part City Council

390
00:17:55,349 --> 00:18:01,129
is allowing this they are being kind of

391
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:05,069
shitty on the no AMJ inside city limits

392
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,169
[ __ ] thing yeah that's ridiculous they

393
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,759
should they should allow at least one

394
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,900
good dispensary within city limits cuz

395
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,900
they're losing out on money they're

396
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,919
losing on so much money and it's just

397
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,960
locally here in Pueblo it's old blood

398
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,950
that is voting against the dispensaries

399
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,679
they're trying to keep downtown a

400
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,779
historic district and let it be so

401
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,780
historic do they put a gym called reps

402
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:29,158
in any way they left it it still looks

403
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,668
like an old school building out front

404
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,710
except for that trendy reps the building

405
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,150
is a lot of that stuff downtown is

406
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,529
untouched there's signs for buildings

407
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,330
that there's signs for businesses that

408
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:45,480
were there way back in the day that

409
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:47,339
don't exist because this those signs I

410
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,589
try to be more diplomatic about talking

411
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,240
[ __ ] about my public officials you're

412
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:53,038
right [ __ ] them because they do really

413
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,480
try to think they control everything and

414
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,150
they don't listen to what their public

415
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,509
wants here well they've had they've had

416
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,580
a history of such actions I mean if you

417
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:04,230
go back to the smoking ban they expand

418
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,668
smoking without putting it to a public

419
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,429
vote then we had to make this whole big

420
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:11,280
issue out of it they've wasted a lot of

421
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:15,419
money and a lot of resources on a lot of

422
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,428
Gaudi [ __ ] ie like the [ __ ] Newman in

423
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,809
school [ __ ] police court or whatever

424
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,900
the [ __ ] that building is and I don't

425
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:23,460
want to go inside of ever ten million or

426
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,140
however much and they still can't

427
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,048
[ __ ] pay enough people put inside

428
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:32,509
there they just have a lot of goddamn

429
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:35,158
issues and marijuana seems to be a

430
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,690
capable tool of solving if you look if

431
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,090
their reports no crimes have gone up

432
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,769
near dispensaries if anything it's gone

433
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:44,009
they just released another report

434
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:45,779
stating that crimes have gone violent

435
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,400
crimes have gone down I guess it's

436
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,079
depending on where you read because any

437
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,769
news report just says what they want no

438
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,929
they they they released a national

439
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,910
a Colorado crime report for the past

440
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,980
night the ninety days like almost

441
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,200
basically like the first quarter which

442
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,779
is a snapshot or probation period yeah

443
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,700
that's a good way of looking at it and

444
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:07,759
it basically everything was down there

445
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,490
were they were like I want to say there

446
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,869
was like 80% of all of the things that

447
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,420
they thought would be shitty were

448
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:15,859
actually yeah roofers realize that the

449
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,600
we'd head to the peaceful guys sitting

450
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,219
on the couch chilling you know we're not

451
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,019
all sitting on the couch but we're doing

452
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,430
our daily things when we get baked the

453
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,930
worst thing we're gonna do is eat

454
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,640
everything in the fridge well here's

455
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,890
what I find hilarious is that they're

456
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,770
trying to find things to highlight now

457
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,320
they're trying I like searching and it's

458
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:35,629
not just people's physical reaction to

459
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,559
marijuana it's it's anything that

460
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,890
marijuana can do horrible to you so Gary

461
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,779
comes from Texas yeah how how is how is

462
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,850
the difference of seeing I'm sure in

463
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,559
Texas you I have friends that have been

464
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:52,549
incarcerated in Texas just for having

465
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,139
weed and here you can carry you I don't

466
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,700
know I fear not a medical patient in

467
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,440
Colorado you can possess an ounce if

468
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,930
you're just any random Joe and Colorado

469
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,360
21 and over how does it feel to just

470
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,700
have it's almost freedom here it is a

471
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:08,990
huge difference that it really took me a

472
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,460
while to adjust to that once you know

473
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,980
I've gone to some of the clubs like in

474
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,049
the springs and you know walk into a

475
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,839
room with a group of people that I don't

476
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,609
know that are all high and getting high

477
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,459
and it's open and it's legal and it's

478
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:24,859
free that's a completely unique

479
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,240
experience for me and I'm 43 years old

480
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,649
nobody has to hide their [ __ ] we have

481
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,569
anybody who's there when the police

482
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,920
would like walk into cloud 9 were you

483
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,210
there I was there when the police walked

484
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,950
and walked through us and hello to

485
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,029
everyone and seemed just pleased that

486
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,160
everybody was there and having a good

487
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,319
time yeah they were like polite and

488
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,910
cordial I was the first person you see

489
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,439

511
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,640
like I'm able to educate them now I'm

512
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,380
not afraid anymore and I've I've been

513
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,030
adult now I know how to present myself

514
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,710
and I feel like well that's really just

515
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:54,379
part of it people not having the fear

516
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,150
just get over your fear of it to the

517
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,190
other just people do it I mean respect

518
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,600
them yes sir no sir no [ __ ] can be a

519
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:08,090
dick to any cops but don't have any

520
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:11,889
super-duper authority how are the cops

521
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,889
in Texas when they find you with weed

522
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,290
any amount of weeds it's identifiable as

523
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,720
weed is that a felony or just a

524
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,279
misdemeanor misdemeanor okay reasonable

525
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:30,920
quantity anything under four ounces

526
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:32,960
misdemeanor okay four ounces well that's

527
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,400
[ __ ] but think about it's Texas and

528
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,690
they're talking about the the Mexican

529
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,490
brick weed I would assume because that's

530
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,519
mostly what's around Texas it's just

531
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,230
they throw it over that [ __ ] border

532
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,960
concentrates though were there a felony

533
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:50,539
just like heroin so having a DAB would

534
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,819
be a felony yeah sure what's the point

535
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:56,470
of that though it's concentrate it's

536
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:58,519
derived it's like wow heroin okay

537
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,529
think about that all my Colorado

538
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:09,799
California Washington Oregon listeners

539
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:11,180
Michigan right here go ahead Illinois we

540
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,220
have a good friend who's Illinois in

541
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,419
Illinois and he's like I can't find weed

542
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,679
anywhere so I did a quick

543
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,200
Google searches like you guys have

544
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,538
medical marijuana there in Illinois and

545
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,429
he's like get it for me find it and so I

546
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:24,710
did more research they've got the rules

547
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,989
in place and there are doctors that can

548
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,019
recommend cannabis for you but there is

549
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:32,480
not a known place that I can find to buy

550
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,950
medical marijuana so some of the states

551
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,389
that claim to have medical marijuana are

552
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,399
kind of [ __ ] and you you can

553
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:38,689
basically grow your own but you guys

554
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,128
that are listening in these states where

555
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,259
you can just drive somewhere down the

556
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:44,209
street and get some dad's and drop a

557
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,940
half gram dab and choke for 20 minutes

558
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,108
and laugh and just take it for granted

559
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,058
this dude right here would have gone to

560
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:51,378
prison you don't look like you'd enjoy

561
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:53,269
prison much by the look so you don't

562
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:54,439
look like the prison type no they don't

563
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:55,759
have a lot of books or computers in

564
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,629
prison those seem to be things you'd

565
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,980
enjoy how much money does Texas so

566
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,449
here's like the big question I don't

567
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,259
take a dad world go ahead it'll go

568
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,369
around the table when you hear us

569
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:07,878
coughing that's what's going on all

570
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:10,220
right here's a question so I think this

571
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:12,469
was something maybe the the number

572
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,720
crunchers and the government dot Oh

573
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,700
Green Green that's who we're dabbing

574
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:23,089
from just a shout out since we're doing

575
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:24,440
it on the show I think the number

576
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:30,648
crunchers in the government wanted to

577
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:32,330
see if the revenue would outdo the

578
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:34,758
revenue made off of marijuana sales

579
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:37,099
would outdo the revenue made off of like

580
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,679
DUI busts marijuana bust properties

581
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,939
these years correct correct yeah I think

582
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,590
that was something they were trying to

583
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,528
see if they were going to do if that's

584
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:47,689
gonna be able to get away with and I

585
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:49,940
would say that's driving legalization as

586
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,690
much as anything yeah cuz Colorado it's

587
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:58,129
more than double really they were saying

588
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:01,009
that a typical year they they net about

589
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:02,719
sixty million in seizures yeah and

590
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:05,028
they're projecting now based on what the

591
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,399
numbers they have this year's first year

592
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:13,759
revenue from taxes 334 million from

593
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:17,349
marijuana sales yeah so it's more than

594
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,349
double so you know

595
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:30,039
we was a crime I used to have to think

596
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,140
[ __ ] the police smile at him on there

597
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,819
behind me and Chuck benefits so the

598
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,860
benefits is marijuana that will becoming

599
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,750
like him growing him from what will come

600
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:40,869
from growing him like how much money can

601
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,660
can community start to save by having

602
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,489
hemp products grown by the community

603
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,308
instead of shopping at [ __ ]

604
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,920
Walmart dr. Bronner's the company that

605
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:52,210
makes him soap has to buy him grown in

606
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,029
Canada and have it shipped to America

607
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,150
what the [ __ ] to make because it's

608
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,558
illegal to produce so the first major

609
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,540
hemp crops that were produced in

610
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:04,410
Colorado guess who swooped that [ __ ] up

611
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,670
bro dr. Bronner's made soap out of it no

612
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,490
I think it was bought before it was

613
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,900
harvested oh yeah which is how you know

614
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:16,839
you're doing a good job you have had a

615
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:19,360
crop like that before how do you how do

616
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:22,329
we fight hypocrisy with vets going on

617
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:25,419
within the state so there's we often see

618
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:29,259
there's the every time I see an alcohol

619
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,360
ad and at the same time see someone or

620
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,970
anytime I see someone like drink a glass

621
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:38,529
of wine and then say marijuana is bad

622
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,769
shits me too we see bars that are

623
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:46,808
polluted our town is polluted with bars

624
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:49,650
we have more bars than we could ever

625
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:55,420
possibly need we do

626
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:57,040
absolutely which how much collateral

627
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:02,019
damage do you think comes from the bar

628
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,359

and went into his heart because he

636
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,990
helped bouncers kick some rough dudes

637
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:31,299

for you this is a and it's interesting

647

658
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:44,859

659
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:46,990
left a bar where you were serving yeah I

660
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:49,869
don't know where you're attached to yeah

661
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,349
Wow and and we had to show like video

662
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:55,389
evidence video evidence that was like

663
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:57,898
this is at what time they were here this

664
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:00,669
is what we were responsible for okay and

665
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:02,528
then there's only a couple of other

666
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,570
details there's only one detail that I

667
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:08,349
will not I won't get that up because

668
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:09,700
it's a detail that is public but in that

669
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,949
detail that's the only thing that

670
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,590
basically saved me and another bar who I

671
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,159
won't say from from getting in a lot of

672
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:23,038
trouble a lot of bars in this town don't

673
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:26,380
take a lot of responsibility bro at all

674
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,940
we can name so many I'm proud that I

675
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,230
don't drink anymore but when I did drink

676
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,000
there would be plenty of bartenders

677
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,038
we're ready just to over serve me

678
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,898
because when you're drunk you tip well

679
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,879
and they build that relationship with

680
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:38,769
you you buddy up the bartender oh yeah

681
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,080

719
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,139
we're seeing that marijuana is like

720
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:05,480

721
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:09,860

clean skippy that's what we's doing to

723
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:13,490
be more clear that up a little bit

724
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,159
because there's there needs to be some

725
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,569

726
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,920
these little kids are given cannabis do

727
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:20,119

have seizures all day long or don't eat

732
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:32,479
or have a debilitating addition when you

733
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,430
give them cancer it cures not hears it

734
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,779

735
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,000
these little kids that have cancer they

736
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:40,279

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,819
little bit of a buzz from it but you

741
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,950

742
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:51,889

support group and get a gallon a rocky

748
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:09,619
road because it is a journey my friend

749
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:11,150
weights kind of a panty understatement

750
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,259
when it comes to movies alright we've

751
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,639
got about if you want to leave at the

752
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:32,660
time you said we've got about 15 minutes

753
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:34,429
so let's let Gary see I think he

754
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,379
addressed us he said I want to discuss

755
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,909
the state of weed in Colorado so we've

756
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,099
talked about how the finances and it's

757
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,899
gonna be global we've talked about

758
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,849
finances and how we see global growth

759
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,980
what else do you see coming from it what

760
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,630
else do you predict since you're you're

761
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,159
a thinker bro you're a far thinker I

762
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,200
think like you said you've got a you

763
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,940
work for a guy that grows I'm too

764
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,589
focused on the grow and I slip on a lot

765
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,170
of the things the logistics that you're

766
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,000
good at so what's your what are your

767
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,039
predictions since you seem to see a lot

768
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,190
clearer image of what's going on than I

769
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,960
do well I don't know you know my guess

770
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,000
is as good as anybody else is right but

771
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,710
I do follow things I did watch the news

772
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,199
and as part of my

773
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,260
I kind of did a review of like the media

774
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,809
coverage on the rollout as a final

775
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:22,050
project for my last yeah do two classes

776
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:24,269
every eight weeks online schedule so

777
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,220
it's pretty hectic but for the last

778
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:29,429
class it was a media and communications

779
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:32,339
class my final project was to look at

780
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:41,009
the media coverage from November 1st

781
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:44,670
2013 to March 1st 2014 the rollout of

782
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:48,750
legalized recreational marijuana sales

783
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:51,510
in Colorado and see how the media

784
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:54,780
depicted and you know the principles we

785
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,970
focused on during this you know during

786
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,780
this class we're how you know the media

787
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:02,368
serves to recreate the reality right it

788
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,950
tells you the same story over and over

789
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,329
so you keep believing what's that how

790
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:08,849
you know your look that's what we're

791
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:10,529
looking for is the analysis of this and

792
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,858
so I'm looking at three media outlets

793
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:18,330
and looking at all the stories they

794
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:20,940
released during that time period and how

795
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:23,400
those stories you know depict the

796
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,630
legalization of marijuana you know what

797
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:32,608
bias and the media outlets I chose were

798
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:34,920
or the BBC CNN and Fox News okay so what

799
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:36,210
I predicted what my thesis was for the

800
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,539
whole project is I'm gonna see it

801
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,579
divided we're you know CNN Lee the

802
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,429
liberal leaning network is gonna be more

803
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,829
in favor Fox the conservative leaning

804
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:48,690
network is gonna be more opposed and the

805
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:53,489
BBC is used was gonna be more neutral

806
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:55,829
right but they just totally wrong really

807
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:59,969
what was is totally wrong was a BBC

808
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:02,690
liberal I found one negative story and

809
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:06,419
it was on CNN and it was an op-ed piece

810
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,070
all the op-ed pieces and Fox and I went

811
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,050
ahead and looked at Forbes 2 because I

812
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,830
wasn't believing yet why not

813
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:16,340
same with Forbes all the op-ed pieces

814
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:18,989
were like some conservative libertarian

815
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,690
talking about why drugs should be legal

816
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,149
all drugs should be legal why the war on

817
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,519
drugs

818
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:30,579
is working lots of ways for money right

819
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,980
nothing negative at all not even on Fox

820
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,710
News not on not even that lady who said

821
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,630
the n-double-a-cp champions well I'm

822
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:57,670
talking about the stories the imprint

823
00:37:37,630 --> 00:38:02,798
released on their website you know I

824
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:05,769
think it's you know the journal the the

825
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:09,389
journalistic you know reflection yeah

826
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:12,190
you know the written stories were not

827
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:18,940
reflecting negatively at all so so when

828
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:21,130
you say that that really makes me upset

829
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,568
that's been the last half of my project

830
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,210
explaining why I was wrong

831
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:27,239
well you're talking about one is Fox

832
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:31,710
News Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch

833
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,848
Rupert Murdoch is literally like a very

834
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,119
Republican of Republican that's Rupert

835
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:40,650
Murdoch conservative based like he like

836
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,480
Fox News represents his his will but

837
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,450
billionaire he also has that libertarian

838
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,740
bent but is so but that's cool it's cool

839
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,480
but what I'm saying is when it breaks

840
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,068
down all the way to the local level

841
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,318
though when it breaks down to our level

842
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:55,778
and we open up our [ __ ] shitty

843
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:58,358
newspaper I grow culture does not

844
00:38:55,778 --> 00:39:02,829
represent the opinions of wait in the

845
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:06,548
toilet so when we open up this [ __ ]

846
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:08,170
newspaper we have so many pieces still

847
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:11,170
in our newspaper our local newspaper

848
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,940
that say wait is bad weed sucks we're

849
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,630
dying this is the reason why it's all

850
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,639
going downhill so that's you know that's

851
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:21,970
local hard-headed old-school old

852
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:24,578
establishment liquor store owners and

853
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:28,389
owners I don't like that [ __ ] what they

854
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,859
you know think about it the same thing

855
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,650
is gonna happen with the paper companies

856
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:34,489
the timber

857
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,170
companies excuse me it's legal that's

858
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:38,479
gonna get bloody because it's you know

859
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:42,500
they're gonna move jobs offshore they're

860
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,800
gonna you know it's gonna be move jobs

861
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,269
offshore from Colorado well if you can't

862
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
cut timber here you're gonna cut timber

863
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:50,119
somewhere yes that's what you do is you

864
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,650
cut timber it's something else I wanted

865
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,929
to ask you about since we're working at

866
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,329
a dispensary now and you're helping this

867
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:58,669
guy set up his stuff do you see cannabis

868
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:00,980
shortages happening in locations yeah

869
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,740
well there was an article yesterday that

870
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,019
I was reading about there's in high

871
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:08,079
times and it was about how the black

872
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:10,639
mark is still thriving in Colorado and

873
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,619
that's the whole thing right that there

874
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,599
aren't enough recreational dispensaries

875
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:18,319
so the ones that are there have very

876
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,819
high prices and we - so ubiquitous that

877
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,880
people just give it off the street

878
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,220
cheaper without the tax so until you

879
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,300
deregulate that enough that it can

880
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:30,709
compete price-wise with the street you

881
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,220
get the black markets gonna remain

882
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,840
intact

883
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:35,359
correct the black mark is completely

884
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,220
unregulated and untaxed correct doesn't

885
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,200
have any hoops to jump through yeah I

886
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:41,449
was driving yesterday I ended up out of

887
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,889
town and realized that the people I was

888
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:44,509
partying with I was gonna need more dabs

889
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:46,969
and I had available with me at the time

890
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,220
I only traveled lightly and so I hit up

891
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:51,319
Facebook and I said hey I'm gonna be in

892
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:53,480
Denver I need a gram or two a shatter

893
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,550
are there any recreational shops around

894
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,840
that you'd recommend I just want her to

895
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,700
check out a wreck shop if I had the

896
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,950
opportunity I've been in plenty of legal

897
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:02,750
shot or Med shops I was actually the

898
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:06,589
first person to buy wreck weed in Pueblo

899
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,269
at the greener side but before I could

900
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,340
blink there were several posts from

901

927
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,880
so we're gonna have it's already global

928
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,309
right already growing across the world

929
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,039
in forest e jungle e type places where

930
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:27,019
cannabis is from that didn't really back

931
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,838
to be beneficial and problematic for the

932
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:33,440
industry well if it's if it's completely

933
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:36,500
legalized let's say people are like oh

934
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,530
that was all [ __ ] they were talking

935
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,320
about and it's fully except in marijuana

936
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,390
what's the next step for what can be

937
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,190
what's what's the next step for Colorado

938
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:49,009
if we're pioneering and leading the way

939
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:51,409
in this cannabis culture and you're all

940
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:55,790
in y'all's opinion what is the next step

941
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:57,679
for not only Colorado one small thing

942
00:42:55,789 --> 00:43:00,440
I'd like to see happen is reinstate

943
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,000
Kings or re its they've outlawed things

944
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,650
like the ganja gourmet and if you don't

945
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,358
know about the ganja man I don't you

946
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:08,000
used to be able to go to this restaurant

947
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,739
and you would sit at a little bar type a

948
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,269
seating area they had a couple tables in

949
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:13,399
the back area and you could smoke

950
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:15,170
cannabis in there they would offer you a

951
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,700
joint or a bomb whatever when he walked

952
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,740
in they had a little a counter that was

953
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:20,989
a dispensary so you could buy they just

954
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:22,250
had good weed good flowers at seven or

955
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,709
eight strains at a decent price I think

956
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,059
was forty five or fifty and eight and

957
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,409
head taxes included because it's a first

958
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:28,670
[ __ ] went weird through paying forty

959
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:30,348
five or fifty an eighth and they need to

960
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,000
sit down and order a meal and everything

961
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,579
in your meal would have weed and it

962
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,358
would all be medicated ooh

963
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:44,089
ganja tip nod I got high as giraffe

964
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,769
[ __ ] Joe Rogan I got high as giraffe

965
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,108
[ __ ] in that restaurant I didn't even

966
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:49,909
realize it I'm just [ __ ] but they

967
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:52,789
bring you a joint before your meal yeah

968
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:54,649
you eat your meal little aperitif and

969
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:56,690
then you eat dessert and I smoke that

970
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,220
joint after my meal and

971
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,409
should be before dessert you know just

972
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,929
get a refresher in the bathroom I

973
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:03,858
realized the bathroom is melting and I

974
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,269
walked out I looked at my girlfriend

975
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:07,098
that was with me at the time and I was

976
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,759
like babe she goes we gotta go and I was

977
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,440
like huh huh

978
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,740
and so we had to make the two-hour trek

979
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,088
from Denver a little bit intoxicated I'm

980
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:16,549
glad she's a pro cuz she was driving

981
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:18,230
that night it was great but we need to

982
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,060
get things like that back that would be

983
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,179
great because you can't do that now well

984
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:25,039
that's take it home but they can't sell

985
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:27,289
it to you edible hot there and you can't

986
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:31,099
consume it on-site and that was half the

987
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:32,900
fun I could see half the reason for that

988
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:34,640
maybe because that's a health issue type

989
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,680
of thing well and it's also well you

990
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,049
could do it they're certified Mme the

991
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,338
kitchens now correct everything's we

992
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,539
could do it just like that but part of

993
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:42,190
the problem is then you're driving out

994
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:44,690
of there

995
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,380

00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,690
bounce and do my job it's been getting a

1050
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,630
lot of stage time and he looks more less

1051
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,460
robotic less he looks less like a game

1052
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:23,568
show host and more like a comedian now

1053
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:25,130
and that's a big try to find the most

1054
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:27,099
gentle way to tell him before is like

1055
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:30,019
your kind of game show host Ebro a

1056
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:32,869
couple of conversations in like passing

1057
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:34,009
though you know like or whatever because

1058
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:35,150
I don't hurt your feelings and I want to

1059
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:48,020
be able to walk away while you deal with

1060
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:50,960
it no learning to if anything that

1061
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:54,949
competition that I didn't lose but lost

1062
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:59,900
there you go taught me is to control

1063
00:47:54,949 --> 00:48:04,368
that energy like you and Tommy is

1064
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,260
abrasive come across as as [ __ ] people

1065
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:08,599
you know to say well yeah and that's

1066
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,030
what like last night was a huge focus

1067
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:15,140
for me was to not let that energy and

1068
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:16,849
excitement take over my body action type

1069
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:18,778
of thing yeah I'm saying every moment of

1070
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:20,999
your stage time last night was precise

1071
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:22,498
it felt it felt like you should have

1072
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:24,028
been doing like you know what I mean

1073

like you said you're one of the only

1074
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:28,498
people that used a lot of the stage only

1075
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:30,808
the more experienced guys use the stage

1076
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:33,149
the first few people before you stood at

1077

1103
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:15,989
you go you know where where were you in

1104
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,929
you know in relation to marijuana as a

1105
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:22,289
business when it was made legal for

1106
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:24,630
medical use when it was made legal for

1107
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:26,400
medical use I wasn't established as a

1108
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,959
business yet I was a medical patient I

1109
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,789
took me a while to catch on as a medical

1110
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:32,798
patient I've been I was a street

1111
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:34,929
when I was in high school right and I

1112
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:36,788
knew the guys that had all of it and so

1113
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,999
they were they kind of recruited me

1114
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:41,140
right because a charismatic and I was

1115
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:42,879
always buying an ounce here and there

1116
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:45,400
great and you know I was that guy that

1117
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,929
seems like into smoking weed I didn't

1118
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,608
want to buy it because I smoked way too

1119
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:49,989
much to buy it so I'd buy an ounce and

1120
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:52,119
make my quarter out of it by giving

1121
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:53,679
everybody else theirs for whatever so

1122
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,989
that's how I started my entrepreneurship

1123
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,568
and then I started shopping at a

1124
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:00,249
specific dispensary I was going to met

1125
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:03,188
amar ministries it was the first

1126
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:05,018
dispensary in Pueblo and the guy I was

1127
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:07,868
shopping there and they were good at

1128
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:09,818
what they did but they didn't I didn't I

1129
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:10,869
can't say I didn't like the way they

1130
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:12,099
treated the customer but I wasn't

1131
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:13,630
satisfied I knew there was something

1132
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:15,338
lacking in their customer service and

1133
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,869
one day a customer we were all sitting

1134
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,130
at the table of businesses I called it

1135
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:19,479
the wild wild west we would sit in there

1136
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,919
and smoke all day and just hang out I

1137
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:22,688
could buy another eight and smoke that

1138
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:24,608
eight while I'm there and just hang out

1139
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:28,868
if I had a day off I just be there [ __ ]

1140
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:30,909
what you oh I want to see 2008

1141
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:34,329
approximately and I've got a bad memory

1142
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:36,399
when it comes to great medical uses

1143
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:38,559
well-established right yeah it was well

1144
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,818
it going and so I'm pretty unregulated

1145
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,659
as Florence just been completely

1146
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:45,699
unregulated I was I was finding friends

1147
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:47,619
that grow and maybe myself that might

1148
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:49,298
have been growing illegally well it was

1149
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:51,400
legal then because I had my card now and

1150
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:52,900
I was bringing those pounds and quarter

1151
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,209
pounds to the dispensary and selling

1152
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,918
those off the shelf and just selling

1153
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:58,088
those to my boss like here you go and he

1154
00:51:56,918 --> 00:51:58,568
would just pay cash for him like here

1155
00:51:58,088 --> 00:52:00,518
you go

1156
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:02,768
and so it'd be like I had two jobs all

1157
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:04,178
the time yeah and so I got in good with

1158
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:06,278
the guys that worked at that dispensary

1159
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:08,259
when I kept going there and a good lady

1160
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:09,369
asked a question and I could tell the

1161
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,958
guy that owned the place around the

1162
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:12,309
place was stumped and I chimed in with

1163
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:14,858
my answer and I could tell he was

1164
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:16,269
impressed so as I left he said hey can

1165
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:18,188
you come help me transplant some plants

1166
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:20,348
tomorrow and of course I showed up early

1167
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:21,548
and eager because I knew this was my way

1168
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:23,289
I wanted to get into the medical

1169
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:25,298
industry I've always liked customer

1170
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:27,849
service but I've always hated customer

1171
00:52:25,298 --> 00:52:29,409
service right it feels really good

1172
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:30,880
helping people that want to be helped

1173
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:33,939
but people that don't want to be helped

1174
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,858
that I've worked at guitar stores where

1175
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:37,719
I want to sell you the really good [ __ ]

1176
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:39,248
but the store wall it's too expensive

1177
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:40,599
and your budget doesn't allow but I can

1178
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:41,169
help you cure your elements with

1179
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,088
cannabis

1180
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,798
that right knowledgeable so it's

1181
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:45,639
wonderful working there and so I was

1182
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:46,929
there for quite a while and then

1183
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:48,578
eventually they shut down the store is

1184
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:50,828
the short story the city came in and

1185
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:52,599
lawyer and a cop and handed us a letter

1186
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:54,970
that said cease and desist that was the

1187
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,930
end of that dispensary Wow what were the

1188
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:58,689
grounds what did they should have done

1189
00:52:55,929 --> 00:53:01,058
you know we were improperly zoned was

1190
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,530
their main clause and we're right we

1191
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:04,390
were right in the middle of town that's

1192
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:08,530
where everything meets is right there

1193
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:09,969
right I made a joke about we should if

1194
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:11,440
we had better products we could charge

1195
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:12,818
more have more business which because I

1196
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,159
I'm a connoisseur I wanted better

1197
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:16,929
product and so they gave me plants and

1198
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,460
they said grow these and they wanted me

1199
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:21,759
to grow their strains and I brought back

1200
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:23,139
their clones that I grew and my boss

1201
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,150
said well [ __ ] you produce better

1202
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:26,588
medicine than me and giggled and so I

1203
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,349
signed up people to be care giver for

1204
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:31,210
and sort of growing for them and I got

1205
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,730
really good at it really quickly and

1206
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:35,289
then I started I bought seeds and as

1207
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,298
soon as I bought seeds I saw the

1208
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:38,619
difference in seed figure compared to

1209
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:41,170
clones because there are seeds where

1210
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:42,789
it's a turd and you don't get bugs every

1211
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,380
time I got clones from any dispensary or

1212
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:45,759
anybody I found something I wish I

1213
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:48,818
wouldn't have found on nearly every

1214
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,150
clone right seed that's your fault if

1215
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:55,929
you get it from a seed crop so I start

1216
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:57,130
girl from seed and then I knew I saw

1217
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:58,389
strains that I liked but I knew there

1218
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,430
was something I could get out of it

1219
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:02,588
better and so I just started doing what

1220
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:03,969
any you know enthusiastic cannabis core

1221
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:05,679
would do and I started getting males and

1222
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:07,629
females and put them in separate and

1223
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,308
rooms together and making seeds and

1224
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,690
growing those and right eventually I

1225
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:12,160
felt comfortable with the seeds I'd

1226
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:14,139
produced from a couple of strands and I

1227
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,179
started sharing them and as soon as

1228
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:18,039
other people posted pictures I saw that

1229
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:19,358
I had some [ __ ] nobody else had and that

1230
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,239
there was a good following that I had to

1231
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:24,130
make a bunch of these and it became not

1232
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,689
only profitable but it was I feel really

1233
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,579
good about the seeds I put out my goal

1234
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,230
was I got a golden goat clone and one of

1235
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:31,960
my first goals was to get golden goat

1236
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:35,019
around the world because it helps so

1237
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:38,769
many medicinal problems it'll help

1238
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:39,759
headaches seizures anxiety it's just a

1239
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,588
really great strain

1240
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,390
golden goats got some great genetics in

1241
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:45,338
there that produces great cannabinoids

1242
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:47,259
that really heal so I wanted that

1243
00:54:45,338 --> 00:54:49,808
available I don't think it's fair that

1244
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:51,280
we hoard genetics that's kind of I mean

1245
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:53,920
people that just keep their clones to

1246
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,720
themselves if you've got a good CBD cut

1247
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,889
a cancer patient should get one of those

1248
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:59,558
you know you shouldn't keep it to

1249
00:54:56,889 --> 00:55:00,940
yourself so I wanted to get it around so

1250
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,380
I started makin seeds and then it just

1251
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,190
grew from there at snowball there was

1252
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:08,140
demand and making the seeds cost money

1253
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:11,079
so I was found a way to make the seats

1254
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:13,179
profitable and then I made a clothing

1255
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,670
line which I sell more shirts and

1256
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:18,690
stickers and pins than I have ever sold

1257
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:21,400
seeds which I find ironic yeah that's

1258
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:23,650
that's testament to branding abilities

1259
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,889
well thank you thank you and I I seem to

1260
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:28,809
be a sort of a social media monster I

1261
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:31,298
like to tweet and Facebook and Instagram

1262
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:33,460
and that's built me up a lot I've got

1263
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:35,130
5,000 Instagram followers which isn't

1264
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,358
huge yet but that's getting there

1265
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,309
spectable right just like that's my

1266
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,529
canvas photography and I try to answer I

1267
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:43,750
hit 90 percent of the questions back I

1268
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,430
respond personally myself it's just me

1269
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,829
doing I read genetics his internet stuff

1270
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:50,019
so a question some of them I have to

1271
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:51,789
I'll say refer to my forum because I do

1272
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,259
have a forum and if you've asked a

1273
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:54,608
question a thousand times it's probably

1274
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,069
answered somewhere else on the internet

1275
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:58,269
you can find that I hate to be rude

1276
00:55:57,068 --> 00:55:59,739
about it but that's it I'll answer your

1277
00:55:58,269 --> 00:56:01,000
some stuff that's I'm like cool if it's

1278
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:02,649
an interesting question I'll definitely

1279
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,269
answer right now but I do the same one I

1280
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,990
get bored with you got it you got to

1281
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:06,670
read your own books

1282
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:07,719
simple books or simple books that you

1283
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:12,280
should have already for gonna grow a

1284
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:15,219
weed right and any any books you would

1285
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:19,660
recommend like except me I was a good

1286
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:22,989
example I the grower that I'm going to

1287
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:25,000
work for his model is to take a

1288
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:29,500
caregiver a new caregiver and train him

1289
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,239
to be a grower and they they have a

1290
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,380
dedicated space that they live in and

1291
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:37,389
they grow in and it's a three grow

1292
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,548
commitment and you split the proceeds of

1293
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:41,170
each grow and he has the market already

1294
00:56:39,548 --> 00:56:45,969
established with his dispensaries right

1295
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:47,769
and so that's how you look that's pretty

1296
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,879
neat yeah and then you're you know

1297
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:51,219
you're free to go you're free to grow

1298
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,210
your own yeah or go to work and so you

1299
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:55,239
know we're thinking about the next

1300
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:57,849
logical step here would be when we talk

1301
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:03,839
to the dispensary their biggest problem

1302
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:06,300
is keeping a a competent you know

1303
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,579
so what if we offered you grower as a

1304
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,370
service you pay us X number of dollars a

1305
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:12,840
month and we provide you with a grower

1306
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:19,289
you know all the expertise we have

1307
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:24,059
oversight the expert guide forty hours a

1308
00:57:19,289 --> 00:57:25,860
week to be there right a lot of guys now

1309
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:27,630
yeah especially these larger

1310
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,519
dispensaries that really have to produce

1311
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:31,619
a product on a consistent basis with

1312
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:34,019
limited space you know you can't afford

1313
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,779
to lose a crop just right right your

1314
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:37,980
schedules too tight so this could ensure

1315
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,450
some continuity and we're thinking

1316
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,389
that's a good way to maybe grow in the

1317
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:44,250
future so you know think about the

1318
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:46,019
impact of that like on you know the

1319
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,480
industry it would be a significant

1320
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:50,130
change would be a real shift everybody

1321
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,900
would be growing quality cannabis which

1322
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:54,480
would really help out help with pricing

1323
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:58,139
start to come down and one more uniform

1324
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,990
product right you'd have more stable

1325
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:02,639
career as a new guy I won't ask you a

1326
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:04,529
question how does the product very now

1327
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,679
what do you see while you're in Colorado

1328
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,000
on a scale of like holy [ __ ] oh man

1329
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,719
what do you see it is that's a good

1330
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,550
question and I've seen like you know

1331
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:17,789
real variation in pricing from

1332
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:20,039
recreational dispensaries to Medical

1333
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:22,769
dispensaries to the street you know huge

1334
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,440
huge variation and a huge variation in

1335
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:27,480
quality cues right from A to Z

1336
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,950
completely from one to ten on the scale

1337
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:33,929
so far no source is more predictable for

1338
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:35,849
quality they're all three justice

1339
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:38,099
underlined whether I'm buying from the

1340
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:40,589
street a medical dispensary or from a

1341
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,449
recreational sensory I'm rolling the

1342
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,039
dice and that's why I recommend the

1343
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:46,199
caregiver model absolutely I've been

1344
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:49,440
I've been a caregiver for the same five

1345
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,879
people for probably five years now and I

1346
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,320
know them all personally we sit on the

1347
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,579
can we sit at this table together and

1348
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,470
talk about what's wrong with them and

1349
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,909
and that's that's really keeping to the

1350
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:59,129
spirit of the caregiver model and that's

1351
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:00,719
what they established when I'm working

1352
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,010
with that's the way they do it too they

1353
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:03,480
really want you to be an actual team

1354
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:07,350
giver check this one out

1355
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,960

[Music]

1385
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,820
seed sales I do seeds is what I do care

1386
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:32,649
giver all of my my flowers are taken up

1387
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:35,170
by my patients and myself I make dad out

1388
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:37,119

1389
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,119
guy wants half dad's half flowers Kevin

1390
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,929

1391
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,639
flowers today

1392
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:44,259
I know what they want one person I have

1393
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,000
to make topicals and food for them and

1394
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,110
it's pain in the ass I don't like doing

1395
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,420
it but it's well worth it you know

1396
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,789
they're gonna take care of people so my

1397
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:53,980
my business is based in seeds and

1398
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:55,719
clothing mostly so the clothing it

1399
01:00:53,980 --> 01:01:01,690
really helped out because you can talk

1400
01:00:55,719 --> 01:01:03,459
about sticker so that's getting super

1401
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:06,070
popular because you can heart dabs now

1402
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:09,309
you don't have to hide it for the seeds

1403
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:11,680
most of my seeds I give them to somebody

1404
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:14,920
and he distributes them for me in his

1405
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,659
manner so I've seen and that goes

1406
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,579
internationally Greg so I've seen a

1407
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:22,089
growth he says a lot of people from

1408
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:24,400
Colorado are inquiring and if we're face

1409
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,289
to face week I can get seeds to you

1410
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,769
but I can only be so many places at one

1411
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:31,840
time I'm not I'm not available in the

1412
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:34,480
recreational shops yet we're still

1413
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:38,110
getting the the OPC there are a lot of

1414
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,550
offers but people want my brand and they

1415
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,710
don't want to help me I feel like they

1416
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:44,560
want to corrupt me and like you were

1417
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:46,090
saying growers I'm busy growing you know

1418
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,059
I'm busy reading and growing and getting

1419
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,380
that OPC going that's it it's a

1420
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:51,849
challenge for a guy like me I'm supposed

1421
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,349
to be in the grow room and the more I

1422
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:56,199
spend out there with the lawyer in the

1423
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:58,239
accountant I get anxious so it's not my

1424
01:01:56,199 --> 01:02:00,699
realm at all so once I get that

1425
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:03,519
established I know my sales will boom I

1426
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:05,409
just need that OPC spot I'm figuring it

1427
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,539
out so you like to take baby steps in

1428
01:02:05,409 --> 01:02:08,739
that I'm not gonna give my brand away oh

1429
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:12,489
you can pump the Michael fix all that

1430
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:18,009
later I'll try I'll try there you go

1431
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:20,349
turn the legs that's yeah yeah your

1432
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:22,000
branding is perfect you do it very very

1433
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:23,380
well and I don't notice that like from

1434
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,920
the very beginning when I first started

1435
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:28,780
look your stuff up it's like consistent

1436
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,730
good I tried to keep this logo to stick

1437
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,530
in your head everybody brags about

1438
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:34,269
California right and so I took the

1439
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,460
Colorado flag straight off and was like

1440
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:39,550

1442
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:45,390

1448
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:05,049
so that's a that's a is what I'm saying

1449
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:07,120
really I don't know this is arguable of

1450
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:08,800
course but what I see is I think that

1451
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,309
the industry is gonna go one of two ways

1452
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,720
we have a real chance like especially me

1453
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:19,420
someone's getting an education someone

1454
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:24,309
like you has a strong background you

1455
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:26,170
apply that in the right way if cannabis

1456
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:27,639
stays illegal like on the state level

1457
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:29,590
say they reschedule when it takes the

1458
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:32,650
state's a few years to catch up that

1459
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:35,380
could be better for us than if it was

1460
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:37,059
like instantly legal all over the world

1461
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,010
at one time when things are really

1462
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:41,110
profits are absolutely higher exactly

1463
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,760
yes and well and you know you also were

1464
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:45,340
able to build like credentials and

1465
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:48,100
expertise and like go through the stuff

1466
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:50,350
and small scale and enlarge it slowly

1467
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:53,079
rather than just be boom large scale all

1468
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:55,659
at once and that's there's a huge

1469
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:57,219
benefit and to find something that works

1470
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,920
and be a bit replicated over and over

1471
01:03:57,219 --> 01:04:01,569
again in a massive market would be

1472
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,769
amazing and you may already be there

1473
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,230
with yours you have you might already

1474
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:07,300
have enough expertise it really sounds

1475
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:11,050
like it to me yeah you know I have the

1476
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:13,240
capabilities right and uh you know like

1477
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,769
the other guy I'm working with he's kind

1478
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:18,459
of in the same spot he has this vision

1479
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:21,849
of a way to like stabilize the whole

1480
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:25,840
grower situation in in the dispensary

1481
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:27,880
market which is like a key element of

1482
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,130
stable growth you know what I mean right

1483
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,680
so I see that it's like a massive

1484
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:35,019
opportunity as well it just it makes

1485
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:37,059
that industry so much more stable you

1486
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:39,460
know agriculture it's hard to get stable

1487
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:41,769
you know it takes a lot of management to

1488
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,909
get a stable production and agriculture

1489
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:44,349
oh yeah especially a product like

1490
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:45,670
cannabis and that's why you end up with

1491
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:47,380
factory farms where everything is

1492
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:49,300
regimented and they put X number of

1493
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:51,760
chemicals in and X number of chemicals

1494
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:54,190
come out and you know because that's the

1495
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,300
best they can do and you know the the

1496
01:04:54,190 --> 01:05:00,610
model we're using the small modules you

1497
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:03,250
keep everything small and organic if one

1498
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:06,579
person has hands on it but you can scale

1499
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:08,349
that okay so you take a guy like me and

1500
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:09,759
ask me how many lights can you run by

1501
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:12,159
yourself that would pretty much be the

1502
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,080
basic question and then I'd say you know

1503
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,759
I could do 10 to 15 lines by myself no

1504
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,139
problem 40 hours a week I'd probably do

1505
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:27,130
more if it weren't a facility that were

1506
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:29,859
easier but like I feel like since I've

1507
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:31,539
got a smaller facility I feel like I'm

1508
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,610
able to love each of those plants more

1509
01:05:31,539 --> 01:05:35,259
absolutely if I had seven kids I feel

1510
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:39,910
like that seventh kid I'm not gonna give

1511
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:41,230
too much of a [ __ ] but if there were

1512
01:05:39,909 --> 01:05:42,719
three of them I probably want to slap

1513
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:45,639
each one of them a little bit more

1514
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:49,029
exactly so I feel like that happens with

1515
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:50,670
your plants that struggle like there's a

1516
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,920
point when it's work that you love

1517
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,300
but I felt like oh [ __ ] before like I'm

1518
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,889
never gonna get through this trim job I

1519
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,960
got a call a couple more friends over or

1520
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:59,369
something once that gets overwhelming it

1521
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,710
becomes work and I feel like the plants

1522
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:03,150
will suffer from that my plants know I

1523
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:08,429
love them because I get to hurt each one

1524
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:10,289
and tell them and I yeah absolutely

1525
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:12,119
that's and you know that's what makes

1526
01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:14,420
the difference right is that personal

1527
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,460
attention that you know the more the

1528
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:18,480
more detailed you can be with everything

1529
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:25,110
the better off you are

1530
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:26,880
absolutely yeah I wasn't that good when

1531
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,769
I first started so it's also a lot of

1532
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,539
experience yes that's then that's the

1533
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:33,059
real key here too it's experience and

1534
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:34,920
you know that's what I feel like I did I

1535
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:37,559
need time to build more experience in

1536
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:45,139
the industry you know I'm confident

1537
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:48,509
about my skills but I need further I

1538
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:59,009
missed all the industry stuff I was busy

1539
01:06:48,510 --> 01:07:00,960
branding creating seeds and strains the

1540
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:02,700
Wolves I've had a couple of offers

1541
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,300
there's been money thrown in my face but

1542
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:08,039
it all feels all those guys feel like

1543
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,510
they're trying to I want to take I read

1544
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,880
genetics and do this with it they don't

1545
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:13,440
understand that that's my baby that it's

1546
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,990
got to be golden for me to jump on that

1547
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,670
yeah I understand that my brand is worth

1548
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:20,219
way more than money I've been living as

1549
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:24,119
a poor white guy for 35 years I'll did

1550
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:33,989
for 35 more I'm good at that yeah I mean

1551
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:37,019
that's you gotta have that so that's

1552
01:07:33,989 --> 01:07:41,339
that's another key element is that there

1553
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:45,269
has to be a real diehard you know Austin

1554
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:47,180
Texas Texas chili parlor where they make

1555
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:50,250
real [ __ ] Texas chili every [ __ ] day

1556
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:53,119
365 days a year then you know there has

1557
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:53,119
to be that route

1558
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,670
in generic you know Bobby nobody will

1559
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,780
have standards about production and

1560
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,309
that's what I'm afraid of

1561
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,839
I'm afraid it's been gonna become weed

1562
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:06,429
Mart and a lot of people will be okay

1563
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:08,818
with it because we're just happy to have

1564
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:12,399
cannabis and they haven't seen top-shelf

1565
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:16,960
cannabis you know excited get a whole

1566
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:19,088
eight for ya and then they're gonna do

1567
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,539
you see the cheap beer sells like a boss

1568
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:25,000
yeah the most yeah so you know the only

1569
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:28,060
way to combat that too is to grow you

1570
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,579
know be as big as you could be and still

1571
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:32,798
keep what you do what you do and that's

1572
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:35,289
you know it's difficult at times for

1573
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:38,710
somebody like you once who has to be

1574
01:08:35,289 --> 01:08:41,979
hands-on with everything but you can be

1575
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:46,119
done my position is a great position to

1576
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:47,948
be in and I try not to take it for

1577
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:49,420
granted I try to wake up and say thank

1578
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:51,039
you something every day

1579
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,899
well you know in the podcast it's a huge

1580
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:55,238
start and doing this growth school is

1581
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:56,979
just amazing just really that's what I

1582
01:08:55,238 --> 01:08:58,629
did do the listeners weren't part of

1583
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,619
that conversation earlier they may have

1584
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:03,489
been I'm not sure we've been recording

1585
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:04,899
for an hour and a half now I said

1586
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:07,000
earlier that I want to turn my version

1587
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:08,379
of the hydro culture podcast into what

1588
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,539
it'll be a gross cool you guys will get

1589
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,069
full-growed class every lesson or every

1590
01:09:10,539 --> 01:09:14,588
episode to be a grow less and so we'll

1591
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:16,600
go from germinating to transplanting to

1592
01:09:14,588 --> 01:09:18,909
the veg stage right up in flower through

1593
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,520
harvest and cure which i think is

1594
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:22,659
important and then we'll teach you Kevin

1595
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:30,580
will come and talk about making Dada

1596
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:31,649
safely tell you what not to do but

1597
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:38,710
that's what's gonna come in the future

1598
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:40,988
that's making safely that's one of the

1599
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:44,829
big threats to the concentrates industry

1600
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:46,238
is the danger of making people take that

1601
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:48,039
stuff too hard yeah there's a lot of

1602
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:57,329
people I still read about about one

1603
01:09:48,039 --> 01:10:00,760
every two weeks so please don't do that

1604
01:09:57,329 --> 01:10:02,050
all of us we've taken far steps and you

1605
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,440
knock us down a little bit every time

1606
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,440
you do it

1607
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:18,059
people in the house they always seem to

1608
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:22,380
be the ones to get the most hurt I agree

1609
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:24,150
I agree that's our version let's not

1610
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,640
pretend like so many dudes there's

1611
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:29,069
absolutely no danger everything

1612
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:33,420
associated with marijuana is rosy and

1613
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:35,369
perfect you know you have to be

1614
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:45,090
responsible with your [ __ ] everybody

1615

school kids are gonna walk by and steal

1618
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:52,500
some buds off of it and take them to

1619
01:10:50,609 --> 01:11:04,429
school and get the whole cop thing going

1620
01:10:52,500 --> 01:11:04,429
on it looks bad on everyone in the car

1621
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:16,920
park some are if you're gonna dab in the

1622
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:18,840
car scary I saw it this weekend does in

1623
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:24,119
Denver saw somebody dropping a dab

1624
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:28,050
driver their knee sloppily yeah on the

1625
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:39,238
interstate that's my friend are you out

1626
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:43,310
of what do you I see a lot of corporate

1627
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:43,309
stuff coming up like via the weed Mart

1628
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:50,550
once people forgot that we can vote on

1629
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:52,319
[ __ ] it feels like and once we remind

1630
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,539
people that we can vote on things there

1631
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,219
will be moratoriums lifted and

1632
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:59,219
dispensaries will put in places and once

1633
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:01,408
money comes to show politicians here my

1634
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:04,289
whatever check for however much here it

1635
01:12:01,408 --> 01:12:08,988
is can we build people will say yes I do

1636
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:08,988
fear a lot of a lot of commercialization

1637
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:13,290
core pretty stuff really I don't like it

1638
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,150
I try not to shop at the theater stores

1639
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:18,840
so that stuff really intimidates me and

1640
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:20,488
I see it could be decline in products in

1641
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,239
quality or it could really increase the

1642
01:12:20,488 --> 01:12:24,279
quality but it's hard to say

1643
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:26,380
River Rock is my largest example that I

1644
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:29,559
know of that produces quality cannabis

1645
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:31,300
on a large scale and it took them they

1646
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,160
have killer products now but it took him

1647
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,230
a couple of years to get to where I

1648
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:37,149
would say that they've got a competitive

1649
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:39,129
product that's its top shelf their top

1650
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:40,599
shelf is top shelf and they produce more

1651
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,989
than any other dispensary that I'm aware

1652
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,940
of

1653
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:45,609
I could be wrong correct me if I am I

1654
01:12:42,939 --> 01:12:48,219
grow culture on Twitter please inform me

1655
01:12:45,609 --> 01:12:50,559
so you know something that that touches

1656
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:55,210
on for me is that you know I'm all about

1657
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:58,180
you know really high volume solutions

1658
01:12:55,210 --> 01:13:01,180
that you know do things well do things

1659
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:09,820
properly organically like the tomato

1660
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:11,829
farm highway I can see that that's kind

1661
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:13,479
of what I fear well because I grow from

1662
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:15,689
my heart and that's no there's no heart

1663
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:18,809
and then that's part of what heals well

1664
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:20,949
that's if you talk but where's the

1665
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:23,850
where's the balance between the two

1666
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:27,010
because demand is gonna dictate

1667
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:30,370
production right and we all know what

1668
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:32,170
the demand is so if doing it with all

1669
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:50,250
your heart your soul doesn't produce

1670
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:52,659
enough they're gonna let strip people I

1671
01:13:50,250 --> 01:14:01,510
mean everything else is flowing to the

1672
01:13:52,659 --> 01:14:05,229
top of profits go to the 1% this is

1673
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:06,880
something if we maybe the answer is I

1674
01:14:05,229 --> 01:14:11,679
was reading something about this co-op

1675
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:14,859
model where small operations boutique

1676
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,980
operations band together where they say

1677
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:20,079
put 10% of their stop cause 10% of their

1678
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:23,409
ownership into a general fund that

1679
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,909
everybody owns part of so the little

1680
01:14:23,409 --> 01:14:26,498
piece of each other's business no matter

1681
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:31,510
how different they are

1682
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:33,908
and we use that unity to fight off you

1683
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:36,248
know r.j. Reynolds who is Jahi

1684
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:39,339
corporation you know individually we're

1685
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:41,649
small businesses together we're huge

1686
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:43,119
co-op you kind of see that in the if

1687
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:45,129
you're in the scene you kind of see that

1688
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:46,689
with the growers like yeah on my scale

1689
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,090
we're kind of we're trying to do that

1690
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:52,629
yeah that I see that is you know that

1691
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:55,630
unity is a real potential way of making

1692
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:58,420
that you know expansion that can meet

1693
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,679
the demand but at the same time keeping

1694
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,630
it in the hands of people who really

1695
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:06,940
give a [ __ ] about the problem yeah keep

1696
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:08,440
us in the grow rooms yeah you know for

1697
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:10,658
me marijuana has always been a sacred

1698
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:13,808
thing even when I didn't view it as

1699
01:15:10,658 --> 01:15:17,439
medicine it was something that did

1700
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:22,349
something from day one I knew the first

1701
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:22,348
time I smelled it before I was smoking

1702
01:15:26,578 --> 01:15:30,549
so I've seen in my mind I've seen those

1703
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:33,038
big farms are talking about big

1704
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,989
greenhouse I I've been in gigantic

1705
01:15:33,038 --> 01:15:37,179
houses forever flowering what's up

1706
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:38,498
bezels are great greenhouses you could

1707
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:40,210
drive cars into those things you could

1708
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:41,679
drive your tractor into there and dig

1709
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:44,769
your holes out for your 12 foot tall

1710
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:47,590
plants and those things that that is the

1711
01:15:44,769 --> 01:15:49,659
future of cannabis in Colorado there are

1712
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:51,340
some states that are gonna try to try to

1713
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:53,529
go really slowly but are we gonna buy up

1714
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:56,739
all of our vacant land all of our land

1715
01:15:53,529 --> 01:16:03,698
that's semi flat and able to get water

1716
01:15:56,738 --> 01:16:04,629
are we just gonna I think the people

1717
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:06,339
just need to learn to grow their own

1718
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:07,779
yeah I like your idea of having a

1719
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:10,119
caregiver teach people give you some

1720
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:12,009
oats here your time or three crops of

1721
01:16:10,118 --> 01:16:14,738
your time yeah get you going this is how

1722
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:16,748
you do it see you grow now get out yeah

1723
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:28,978
and then you've helped us grow and then

1724
01:16:16,748 --> 01:16:32,019
you have that I do a lot of teaching

1725
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:37,929
yeah I should have charged one dollar

1726
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:40,449
per hour and that's that's what I'm here

1727
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:43,239
for I feel like I've done I don't

1728
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:44,949
like stutter and stop talking a lot have

1729
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:46,149
fun not super good on a mic but I feel

1730
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:47,739
like I know enough towards worth

1731
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:49,149
listening to where I can write I can get

1732
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:50,170
you through [ __ ] if you deal with me for

1733
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:52,689
enough episodes we'll get comfortable

1734
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:57,039
together when that teaching stuff is

1735
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:58,359
it's that's where you know I was a drum

1736
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,340
teacher for quite a while I used to

1737
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:02,619
teach I teach music so I steer teen year

1738
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:10,210
old boys how to play drums the people

1739
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:12,849
who value that's kind of a great huge

1740
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:15,939
compliment it's been teaching for free

1741
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:21,610
means you do it from your heart just

1742
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:22,929
reflects the plan yeah it's a sacred

1743
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:25,539
plant like you said we have to give it a

1744
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:27,400
lot of respect and I feel when I see

1745
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:32,399
somebody started that I know I'm just

1746
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:32,399
like oh it's like seeing abused monkeys

1747
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:41,340
we have to be thinking and I hope that

1748
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:44,320
you know your listeners and yourself

1749
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:45,819
just spread that thought among you know

1750
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:53,399
people in the community we need to be

1751
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:53,399
thinking about you know how we can

1752
01:17:54,359 --> 01:18:00,909
resist sometimes I have to rely on just

1753
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,550
the dispensaries and the corporations

1754
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:04,869
[Music]

1755
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:06,970
I don't think and sometimes I'll be in a

1756
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:08,769
pinch if I'm going to a comedy show I

1757
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:15,730
love to eat and I said we'll stop at a

1758
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:45,190
shop that I grow from my heart that

1759
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:46,059
corporate machine okay research that

1760
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:48,239
sounds like it might have been some

1761
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,240
mile-high

1762
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:59,219
that's something else you know the

1763
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:02,090
edibles is a whole different aspect of

1764
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:05,340
cannabis consumption that I haven't even

1765
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:08,220
began to touch you know something that

1766
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:12,569
like just as in the dark about anybody

1767
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:16,070
it's a high dose seeing everything I'm

1768
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:18,119
some licensing just because I research

1769
01:19:16,069 --> 01:19:20,789
of the kitchen stuff

1770
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:22,529
yes today because I have no desire to do

1771
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:24,930
a kitchen I'm not a cook yeah that's

1772
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:27,509
that's crazy that's probably why there

1773
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:30,200
is no place that serves cannabis least

1774
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:32,789
foods because those regulations are

1775
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:53,369
several pages of the standards of the

1776
01:19:32,789 --> 01:19:55,979

a sore subject bro the Ultimate Warrior

2015
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:09,190
is gone growing up as a kid bro I

2016
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:11,809
remember watching all the wrestling and

2017
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:14,179
I didn't love anybody more than the

2018
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:16,160
Ultimate Warrior that was my guy you'd

2019
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:18,199
grab the ropes shake the [ __ ] out of him

2020
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:21,079
and the fireworks go off behind him oh

2021
01:33:18,198 --> 01:33:23,988
man there are many great wrestlers and

2022
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:25,640
at times I had switched my favorites but

2023
01:33:23,988 --> 01:33:29,479
I would have to say if you told me to

2024
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:31,579
pick one from forever the Ultimate

2025
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:35,149
Warrior would be the top of my list the

2026
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:36,920
top dog yeah eww yeah I think his uh his

2027
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:40,299
face paint was stolen by the wu-tang

2028
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,300
clan and they made their little Wooten

2029
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:50,948
what's your favorite battle with

2030
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,948
Ultimate Warrior that you remember

2031
01:33:57,588 --> 01:34:08,668
every year did he push up earthquake one

2032
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:13,128
time yeah he was his charisma his

2033
01:34:08,668 --> 01:34:15,838
persona was was unmatched in my opinion

2034
01:34:13,128 --> 01:34:18,899
only person has a comparable persona to

2035
01:34:15,838 --> 01:34:22,738
that in my opinion is the Undertaker and

2036
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:27,149
it's not as energetic but the intensity

2037
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:29,338
of it is entirely there so absolutely

2038
01:34:27,149 --> 01:34:30,599
I've kind of fallen out of wrestling I

2039
01:34:29,338 --> 01:34:32,158
haven't watched in quite a while but

2040
01:34:30,599 --> 01:34:34,078
when I saw on Facebook that he killed

2041
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:40,288
himself did he did he come stuff that's

2042
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:41,908
what I ran attack okay I'm gonna Google

2043
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:43,648
that right quick but once I saw that he

2044
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:48,918
was gone I was I was kind of heartbroken

2045
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:51,679
he's like aw man so I'm gonna sound says

2046
01:34:48,918 --> 01:34:53,698
Ultimate Warrior found dead at 54 I

2047
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,868
apologize if I jump the gun and said he

2048
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:57,058
killed himself because I read that on

2049
01:34:54,868 --> 01:35:00,179
Facebook and I don't trust Facebook days

2050
01:34:57,059 --> 01:35:01,859
after oh this websites playing music and

2051
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:04,109
muted it for you days after his

2052
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:12,539
induction into the WWE Hall of Fame and

2053
01:35:04,109 --> 01:35:14,459
I feel weird saying WWE yeah he just got

2054
01:35:12,538 --> 01:35:18,179
inducted right before WrestleMania on

2055
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:21,019
Sunday so on Saturday he was inducted

2056
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:21,019
into the Hall of Fame

2057
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:31,639
finally the cause of death was not

2058
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:52,890
released so I apologize that I said on

2059
01:35:31,640 --> 01:36:26,640
Facebook that was going on in the

2060
01:35:52,890 --> 01:36:29,310
background then yeah or the domed yeah I

2061
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:38,400
prefer the way the other one hits but I

2062
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:40,380
think that one looks better so stupidly

2063
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:48,059
did not take enough concentrates with me

2064
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:49,650
and I had to have twice that so Facebook

2065
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,870
and eat sand dabs and big shoutouts to

2066
01:36:49,649 --> 01:36:54,239
the people that helped me out I got some

2067
01:36:51,869 --> 01:36:54,809
super quality dabs from some friends old

2068
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:57,119

2072
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:12,330
couple dabs after a show late last night

2073

2079
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:30,880

2080
01:37:29,409 --> 01:37:33,369
a FOMO it's called the fear of missing

2081
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,510
out I've got that I don't want to miss

2082
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:54,489
anything that's part of the reason I

2083
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:59,409
spend money I shouldn't spend part of

2084
01:37:54,489 --> 01:38:04,630
the reason I can't really place is way

2085
01:37:59,409 --> 01:38:08,079

2086

01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:14,260
months with legal marijuana Denver has

2113
01:39:11,409 --> 01:39:18,189
not turned into an urban wasteland so

2114
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:23,829

01:39:36,859 --> 01:39:44,880
thanks for letting me [ __ ] with you just

2121
01:39:43,680 --> 01:40:02,579
be right in your [ __ ] name on the

2122
01:39:44,880 --> 01:40:03,840
wall so what else could tag that so

2123
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,819
we've had legal marijuana for three

2124
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,380
months and this report says after three

2125
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:09,359
months of legal marijuana Denver has not

2126
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,430
turned into an urban wasteland in fact

2127
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:14,039
as Vox reported this week denver crime

2128
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:15,900
in the first two months of 2014 is down

2129
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:19,890
across the board from the first two

2130
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:21,988
months of 2013 yes it's still early but

2131
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:23,610
the numbers so far don't suggest that

2132
01:40:21,988 --> 01:40:24,389
Denver is about to succumb to a crime

2133
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:27,059
wave

2134
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:29,789
fueled by pot addicted hooligans as some

2135
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:31,770
law-enforcement officials warned as pot

2136
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:33,689
addicted hooligans haven't ravaged the

2137
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:45,750
town yet proud of you guys you're doing

2138
01:40:33,689 --> 01:40:48,779
well you're holding on your [ __ ] we just

2139
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:53,550
[ __ ] destroy destroy that's what we

2140
01:40:48,779 --> 01:41:03,149
do yeah because we weren't smoking pot

2141
01:40:53,550 --> 01:41:04,739
before it was purchase purchase it was

2142
01:41:03,149 --> 01:41:06,960
[ __ ] the crime we were committing

2143
01:41:04,738 --> 01:41:08,609
then now we're legit no we're good

2144
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,050
law-abiding citizens we mentioned on the

2145
01:41:08,609 --> 01:41:11,969
last podcast if you guys didn't mention

2146
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:14,190
or listen one of the things they were

2147
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:16,198
worried about they make money

2148
01:41:14,189 --> 01:41:18,479
confiscating land and vehicles and money

2149
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:20,069
by doing weed raids and they were

2150
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,319
concerned they were gonna lose that

2151
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:26,130
revenue but we have surpassed that by

2152
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:30,630
pot sales they're not worried we're

2153
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:34,590
gonna have your [ __ ] confiscated

2154
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:38,640
vehicles and [ __ ] that's cool so I'm

2155
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:40,170
gonna continue whoa that can't be the

2156
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,030
next paragraph to the same story

2157
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:43,529
Wow it is it says the 25 year old is

2158
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:45,090
shot dead trying to sell marijuana the

2159
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:46,409
old-fashioned illegal way two men from

2160
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:48,449
Texas set up a warehouse

2161
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:49,710
more than they would ever need and three

2162
01:41:48,449 --> 01:41:52,979
people buying pot in a grocery store

2163
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:53,939
parking lot or robbed at gunpoint while

2164
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:56,250
no one expected the state's

2165
01:41:53,939 --> 01:41:57,569
first-in-the-nation recreational sales

2166
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,250
would eliminate the need for dangerous

2167
01:41:57,569 --> 01:42:00,569
underground sales overnight the violence

2168
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:02,670
has raised concerns among police

2169
01:42:00,569 --> 01:42:04,619
prosecutors and pop advocates that the

2170
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:08,850
black market for marijuana is alive and

2171
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:10,409
well in a Colorado indeed the black

2172
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:13,980
market is alive and well here in

2173
01:42:10,409 --> 01:42:16,460
Colorado it's the beautiful rainbow II

2174
01:42:13,979 --> 01:42:19,079
market it's not black dude it's not

2175
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:22,050
ridiculously overpriced it's not under

2176
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:24,659
trimmed under cured under purge the

2177
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:26,100
black market is beautiful because they

2178
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:29,939
don't have to rush anything they don't

2179
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:33,360
have to mass-produce anything I hope we

2180
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:35,669
can try to figure out a way to get the

2181
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:37,579
quality of the black market to the

2182
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:40,170
dispensaries and shops one of these days

2183
01:42:37,579 --> 01:42:43,489
but and also the pricing keeps people

2184
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:45,989
from wanting to go to the dispensaries

2185
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:49,500
you're nodding cats naughty countries

2186
01:42:45,989 --> 01:42:50,729
don't have to pay taxes right you can

2187
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,140
sit on the couch while you're there and

2188
01:42:50,729 --> 01:42:54,179
blaze a bowl and you don't have to stand

2189
01:42:52,140 --> 01:43:01,050
in line and wait some people don't like

2190
01:42:54,180 --> 01:43:02,430
that [ __ ] I feel that there's gonna be

2191
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:05,000
and that's why the black market will

2192
01:43:02,430 --> 01:43:07,590
exist there's the option for both still

2193
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,500
some of the older cats we know well not

2194
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:12,060
go into dispensaries they just they're

2195
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,649
afraid of it they're paranoid by it for

2196
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:15,570
some reason they're all afraid of that

2197
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:17,039
list I don't want to be on some list man

2198
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:17,489
is what we hear from a lot of the older

2199
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,189
cats

2200
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:21,659
so my response used to be so you just

2201
01:43:20,189 --> 01:43:24,719
want to get arrested for a legal weed

2202
01:43:21,659 --> 01:43:27,569
like if you just says you can carry pot

2203
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:31,920
but I think I did that thing my grandma

2204
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:33,809
used to say which is I digress I've

2205
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,590
never said that before I think it sounds

2206
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:39,720
funny I was doing it though the article

2207
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:41,789
continues with scary stories from Denver

2208
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:44,039
and its suburbs but wait crime is down

2209
01:43:41,789 --> 01:43:46,260
in Denver isn't it which is why the AP

2210
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:47,970
has only anecdotes one paragraph is the

2211
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:50,850
closest the article comes to attempting

2212
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:52,770
to find actual figures it's difficult to

2213
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:54,570
measure whether whether there has been

2214
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:56,340
an increase in pot related crimes beyond

2215
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:58,049
anecdotal reports because no one either

2216
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:59,699
side the federal or state level is

2217
01:43:58,050 --> 01:44:01,289
keeping track of numbers of killings

2218
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:03,920
robberies and other crimes linked

2219
01:44:01,289 --> 01:44:07,409
directly to marijuana

2220
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:09,569
have we had any major marijuana murders

2221
01:44:07,409 --> 01:44:15,989
lately has there been have there been

2222
01:44:09,569 --> 01:44:18,359
any unsolved weed murders no I'll admit

2223
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:20,429
there have been a few break-ins and

2224
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:21,119
small residual crimes resulting but

2225
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:25,220
nothing

2226
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:25,220
[ __ ] happens no matter what you're doing

2227
01:44:26,869 --> 01:44:33,569
right less than what a 7-eleven would

2228
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:34,920
deal with because you usually find a

2229
01:44:33,569 --> 01:44:36,359
couple of homeless dudes out front

2230
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,890
looking for cigarettes there's that one

2231
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:41,849
weird guy that seems to be leaning up

2232
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:43,410
against the payphone like that's more

2233
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:45,030
riffraff than you see the dispensaries

2234
01:44:43,409 --> 01:44:47,099
don't allow that they rush you off you

2235
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,019
can't hang out here homeless guy look

2236
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:54,120
like you're bad for business

2237
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:55,770
sure oh man that's kind of weird all

2238
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:56,579
right did I scroll down I don't want to

2239
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:58,590
okay

2240
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:00,630
so violent property crimes are down in

2241
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:01,560
Denver and we have no way of knowing how

2242
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:03,659
many of the crimes have been committed

2243
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,820
related to legalized marijuana yet the

2244
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:07,529
AP The Associated Press goes ahead and

2245
01:45:05,819 --> 01:45:10,039
quotes law enforcement officials who say

2246
01:45:07,529 --> 01:45:13,649
the entire region is erupting into chaos

2247
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:15,539
last night I didn't see much chaos most

2248
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:17,789
chaos I saw was inside the comedy show

2249
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:19,170
and it was hilarious but the same people

2250
01:45:17,789 --> 01:45:20,760
who predicted as much before the

2251
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:22,680
legalization took effect and so of

2252
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:26,039
course have an interest in seeing it

2253
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:27,600
come to pass these people predicted that

2254
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:30,090
we're gonna fail and so they want to see

2255
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:33,240
us fail they want to be right they're

2256
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:36,180
haters they just want to be right there

2257
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:38,789
are some three million people in the

2258
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:40,020
Denver metropolitan area all of them are

2259
01:45:38,789 --> 01:45:43,609
trying to park in the same [ __ ]

2260
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,610
parking spot last night I think I was

2261
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:49,680
pop weather pot is legal or not and

2262
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,750
there will be crimes that in some way

2263
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:53,400
involve pot whether a pot is legal or

2264
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:55,680
not just as their crimes related to

2265
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:57,659
alcohol money sex and charity hockey

2266
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:00,510
games why did they pick charity hockey

2267
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:02,099
games because people fight yeah it's

2268
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:13,110
just random they wanted to pick

2269
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:15,240
something obscure there's just as many

2270
01:46:13,109 --> 01:46:16,769
crimes related to the liquor stores and

2271
01:46:15,239 --> 01:46:19,319
money money's got plenty of crime

2272
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:21,060
attached to it the banking systems sex

2273
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:23,609
prostitution has plenty of money

2274
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,289
attached to that so they go on to say

2275
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:27,599
it's also certainly possible that the

2276
01:46:25,289 --> 01:46:29,310
high tax on pot in Colorado has enabled

2277
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,510
black markets to continue and exist

2278
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:34,289
that's kind of what I was hinting at

2279
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:38,430
earlier that 25% tax makes street weed

2280
01:46:34,289 --> 01:46:39,420
is cheap if you know the right people if

2281
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,950
you're hooked up and if you've been here

2282
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,359
for a while you probably know where

2283
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:44,279
there's a thirty dollar eight you know

2284
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:46,259
what I mean you probably find 175 dollar

2285
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:48,539
routes if you shopped around yeah yeah

2286
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:50,220
if you don't care too much about quality

2287
01:46:48,539 --> 01:46:52,680
you can find 150 dollar routes around

2288
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:55,860
here from one of your friends if you buy

2289
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:59,850
that same 150 dollar ounce which that's

2290
01:46:55,859 --> 01:47:01,259
not gonna happen at a dispensary some of

2291
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:03,449
the medical places

2292
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,650
you can yeah what that doesn't count for

2293
01:47:03,448 --> 01:47:06,238
what I'm getting at because I was gonna

2294
01:47:04,649 --> 01:47:10,558
I'm just headed recreational he had the

2295
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:13,348
rec shops 200 at least closer to five

2296
01:47:10,559 --> 01:47:33,090
like I've seen go for 450 in the rec

2297
01:47:13,349 --> 01:47:35,369
shops man that's a lot of taxes dude so

2298
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:38,460
that's and then that's exactly the black

2299
01:47:35,368 --> 01:47:40,229
market will continue to exist it's also

2300
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,239
at least possible that pot is fueling

2301
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:44,368
crime that were it not for legalization

2302
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:49,768
both violent and property crime would

2303
01:47:44,368 --> 01:47:52,828
have fallen even more how so what if

2304
01:47:49,769 --> 01:47:54,630
somebody can tweet me how legalized

2305
01:47:52,828 --> 01:47:57,090
marijuana contributes to crime I would

2306
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:59,340
appreciate it like street crime less

2307
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:00,960
legalized cannabis how it's causing how

2308
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,690
it would contribute how would prevent

2309
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,179
crime rates from going down let me know

2310
01:48:03,689 --> 01:48:21,299
maybe I'm missing something I'd like to

2311
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:22,679
have an open mind almost I would see 90%

2312
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:33,300
of the people we hang out with their

2313
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:34,828
cannabis consumers yeah at some point

2314
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,538
yeah at some point I think they've all

2315
01:48:34,828 --> 01:48:38,038
gotten stoned with us at you know all of

2316
01:48:36,538 --> 01:48:39,899
our friends pop down once in a while

2317
01:48:38,038 --> 01:48:43,380
with us and

2318
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:52,920
at least we are you know bad people dude

2319
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:54,389
we're not any crimes yeah I don't I

2320
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,099
don't see how they're coming up with

2321
01:48:54,389 --> 01:48:58,079
that and this article agrees with us

2322
01:48:56,099 --> 01:48:59,520
that's this article is kind of saying

2323
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,139
the same thing as I like where is that

2324
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,400
so they continue this is the last

2325
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:04,170
paragraph it says but that's all

2326
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:06,539
speculation there's no evidence that any

2327
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:08,940
of those things are happening all we

2328
01:49:06,539 --> 01:49:10,260
have from law enforcement so perhaps

2329
01:49:08,939 --> 01:49:11,848
journalists should hold off on the

2330
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,070
panicky stories and pop field crime

2331
01:49:11,849 --> 01:49:16,829
waves especially since the early data

2332
01:49:14,069 --> 01:49:18,868
showed that crime has actually dropped

2333
01:49:16,829 --> 01:49:21,300
crimes going down you guys legalized

2334
01:49:18,868 --> 01:49:23,639
cannabis and crime drops so they're just

2335
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:28,289
saying [ __ ] and the data actually says

2336
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:52,380
that it dropped so the law enforcement

2337
01:49:28,289 --> 01:49:57,389
people are just saying things lowering

2338
01:49:52,380 --> 01:50:04,099
crime Colorado rakes in say raising

2339
01:49:57,389 --> 01:50:06,480
revenue 3.2 million dollars in February

2340
01:50:04,099 --> 01:50:08,400

01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:10,229
medical and recreational marijuana sales

2342
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:12,000
and February increased from the previous

2343
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:16,559
month according to figures released by

2344

the state two million dollars in

2345
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:22,980
February below the state's projection of

2346
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:31,348
3.7 but slightly above the 2.9 million

2347

hundred and thirty-eight thousand two

01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,030
hundred and fifty three dollars from the

2369
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:40,569

2373
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:52,270
tax on medical marijuana produced

2374
01:51:47,829 --> 01:51:54,760
revenues of what is that oh it's one

2375
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,960
point zero to two and then it's a whole

2376
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:59,199
nother paragraph because the way this

2377
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:01,210
page advertised one point zero to two

2378
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:06,300
million in February and increase from

2379
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:06,300
the nine hundred and thirteen thousand

2380
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:09,730
nine hundred thirteen thousand five

2381
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:11,560
hundred nineteen dollars collected in

2382
01:52:09,729 --> 01:52:13,629
January and far above the seven hundred

2383
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:17,430
and ninety one thousand dollars the

2384
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:19,690
stated per day projected in February

2385
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:21,909
conversely the state projected that the

2386
01:52:19,689 --> 01:52:23,619
fifteen percent excise tax on the sale

2387
01:52:21,909 --> 01:52:25,840
of recreational marijuana would bring in

2388
01:52:23,619 --> 01:52:27,519
seven hundred and thirty nine thousand

2389
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,130
three hundred and thirty dollars the

2390
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,750
actual total was three hundred and

2391
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:34,029
thirty nine thousand six hundred and

2392
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:36,250
fifty fifteen dollars which is fifty

2393
01:52:34,029 --> 01:52:38,229
four percent below expectations the

2394
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:40,810
fifteen percent excise tax produced a

2395
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:42,279
hundred ninety three thousand a hundred

2396
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:43,750
ninety five thousand three hundred and

2397
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:44,699
eighteen in January I'm trying to read

2398
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:47,729
ahead

2399
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:51,569
I see other states reading this article

2400
01:52:47,729 --> 01:52:54,119
somebody uh some governor and some small

2401
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:58,009
town is going holy [ __ ] they made more

2402
01:52:54,119 --> 01:52:58,010
money on weed than our whole town

2403
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:07,979

2404
01:53:03,149 --> 01:53:09,389

2405
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:13,909

2438
01:54:31,289 --> 01:54:34,859
[ __ ] burgers that's part of my

2439
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:36,780
problem but I don't want to follow every

2440
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:45,739
trend I'm a little bit older than a lot

2441
01:54:36,779 --> 01:54:45,739
of you guys daily and I can all at once

2442
01:54:56,899 --> 01:55:01,920
I'll take the pins before the nascar

2443
01:54:59,488 --> 01:55:05,039
jacket so if anybody wants to throw down

01:55:08,698 --> 01:55:14,129
four or five pins

2447
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:17,698
that's a highly-educated pin I'd rock

2448
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:20,429
that and if there was a sweet stone pin

2449
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:23,158
I may put that one on a hat but I feel

2450
01:55:20,429 --> 01:55:25,829
I'm a minimalist and I feel if if I put

2451
01:55:23,158 --> 01:55:28,170
20 on there that takes away from each

2452
01:55:25,829 --> 01:55:30,539
one if I have to then each of those must

2453
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:32,658
be my [ __ ] favorite but you can guys

plug for a task there's a reason why

2463

2469
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:09,480
if you guys forgot we're talking about

2470
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:10,949
how much money Colorado made from the

2471
01:57:09,479 --> 01:57:12,569
sales of cannabis and what I'm trying to

2472
01:57:10,949 --> 01:57:13,859
do is encourage other states to join in

2473
01:57:12,569 --> 01:57:15,239
I'm just hoping that somebody makes

2474
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:16,739
rules is listening to how much money

2475
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:18,899
these people made is when you see other

2476
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:25,829
people making money you want some or you

2477
01:57:18,899 --> 01:57:27,239
hate them anymore just inspires me to do

2478
01:57:25,829 --> 01:57:28,439
better so I hope other states see all

2479
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:30,079
this money we're making it want to jump

2480
01:57:28,439 --> 01:57:33,449
in I'm gonna read now to stab setting in

2481
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,710
just a few months just a few months into

2482
01:57:33,449 --> 01:57:37,010
the first year of legalized recreational

2483
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:39,300
marijuana sales finding certainty

2484
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:40,860
finding certainty when it comes to pot

2485
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:42,539
revenues has proven to be elusive

2486
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:45,210
in February Governor John Hickenlooper

2487
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:47,039
--zz Budget Office predicted tax and fee

2488
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:48,810
revenues for marijuana would total about

2489
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,479
a hundred and thirty-four million

2490
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:54,150
dollars in the fiscal year however a

2491
01:57:51,479 --> 01:57:55,769
month later the state's Legislative

2492
01:57:54,149 --> 01:58:00,269
Council said the total would be half as

2493
01:57:55,770 --> 01:58:01,770
much the legislators joint Budget

2494
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:03,600
Committee on Tuesday pledged to craft a

2495
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:05,070
bill that would force the state to wait

2496
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,710
until it had actual figures before

2497
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:08,729
spending the revenues from marijuana

2498
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:10,109
that's what a drug dealer would do to

2499
01:58:08,729 --> 01:58:12,149
you know wait for you spend your shoot

2500
01:58:10,109 --> 01:58:14,099
if you're right this story was first

2501
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:15,989
published on the Denver Post calm and I

2502
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:17,490
read it from the cannabis feel like I

2503
01:58:15,989 --> 01:58:19,739
should give them credit often cuz they

2504
01:58:17,489 --> 01:58:32,639
helped to show out a lot just by posting

2505
01:58:19,739 --> 01:58:34,229
all this good [ __ ] stead of crap I guess

2506
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,030
they can't do anything until they've got

2507
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:38,699
actual figures so they can't spend any

2508
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:41,279
that's I agree with that I think that

2509
01:58:38,699 --> 01:58:42,239
should be let's write your money until

2510
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:46,789
you [ __ ] have it

2511
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:48,599
yeah that's agreed with you there so uh

2512
01:58:46,789 --> 01:58:49,890
seems like we're on a good roll it's

2513
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:51,600
news I'm gonna read one more thing and

2514
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:53,730
then we're gonna chat for a second here

2515
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:57,000
I've got something I want to rant about

2516
01:58:53,729 --> 01:58:57,719
after I read this article the Denver

2517
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,689
County Fair

2518
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:02,730
Ben Kevin and I had a little talk about

2519
01:59:00,689 --> 01:59:05,099
this the Denver County Fair is doing

2520
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:06,109
something that I find revolutionary and

2521
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:08,280
I'm impressed

2522
01:59:06,109 --> 01:59:10,319
the Denver County Fair has been known

2523
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:12,149
for being

2524
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:14,189
not your normal County Fair they've had

2525
01:59:12,149 --> 01:59:17,159
some weird and freaky exhibits before

2526
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:19,829
and crazier events and I guess

2527
01:59:17,159 --> 01:59:21,090
counterculture type stuff so when an

2528
01:59:19,829 --> 01:59:25,319
article that was on the Denver Post

2529
01:59:21,090 --> 01:59:26,760
written by Steve Raab I hope I didn't

2530
01:59:25,319 --> 01:59:28,109
butcher your name there's two A's in a

2531

row there and that always [ __ ] me up

2532
01:59:28,109 --> 01:59:36,029

2533
01:59:29,909 --> 01:59:39,420

2534
01:59:36,029 --> 01:59:40,769
way I'm gonna share with you guys that's

2535
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:43,770

2539
01:59:47,819 --> 01:59:52,049
this like we're a commercial pot plant

2540
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:54,689
growing competitions pot brownie judging

2541
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:56,220
pipes vaporizers rolling papers oh and

2542
01:59:54,689 --> 02:00:03,269
by the way there's also a County Fair

2543
01:59:56,220 --> 02:00:05,550
taking place counties anyway so but

2544

2546
02:00:08,909 --> 02:00:12,359
public interest is high that's such a

2547
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:13,920
great I read it all [ __ ] up cuz I was

2548
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:16,349
trying not to laugh even the first time

2549
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,670
I read it I laughed out loud organizers

2550
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:19,440
said Tuesday that the fair's pot

2551
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:21,510
pavilion will now occupy the entire

2552
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:23,250
floor of the national Western complex

2553
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:26,730
during the event which is August 1st

2554
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:28,409
through 3rd originally the pot pavilion

2555
02:00:26,729 --> 02:00:30,869
was going to take just half of the 3rd

2556
02:00:28,409 --> 02:00:32,340
floor said fair director Dana Kane but

2557
02:00:30,869 --> 02:00:36,239
the response has just been enormous

2558
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:38,310
we're having to turn away sponsors so

2559
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:40,409
the fairs kind of a weird place to go

2560
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:46,110
until we introduce weed and now they

2561
02:00:40,409 --> 02:00:48,260
have to turn down sponsors so there will

2562
02:00:46,109 --> 02:00:51,000
be no actual cannabis on the premises

2563
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:53,850
plant and brownie judging will take

2564
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,310
place off-site then shown via video at

2565
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:58,020
the pot pavilion but sponsors and

2566
02:00:56,310 --> 02:01:00,810
vendors will be showing and selling

2567
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:03,780

2569
02:01:03,779 --> 02:01:10,349

2570
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:12,150

2571
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:17,070
the third floor will be restricted to

2572
02:01:12,149 --> 02:01:28,710
age 21 and over we've been to some

2573
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:30,329
places where I don't think you realize

2574
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:33,090
if you kicked us out we're all leaving

2575

2577
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:56,369

2579
02:01:56,369 --> 02:02:02,189
competing will be there means we got a

2580
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:07,710
girl some we'd get a special crop

2581
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:10,639
selected for that for that don't get to

2582
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:10,640

prizes will be given for fastest join

2584
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:22,259
trolling using using oregano in place of

2585
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,609
weed table or some [ __ ] you know so that

2586
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:26,310
people can watch new everyone rolls the

2587
02:02:23,609 --> 02:02:27,659
fastest joint get surprised but part of

2588
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:33,990
rolling a good joint is making it burn

2589
02:02:27,659 --> 02:02:35,880
kids will be arranging shuttle rides to

2590
02:02:33,989 --> 02:02:38,099
nearby dispensaries and recreational

2591
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:41,220
stores I heard some shops to get on that

2592
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:44,190
[ __ ] make some money okay noted that the

2593
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:46,050
pop billions poster a cherry pie with a

2594
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:48,599
crust cut out resembling a marijuana

2595
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:50,940
leaf is outselling the fares main poster

2596
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:53,730
by a 10 to 1 ratio

2597
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:56,519
so more people want to buy this that

2598
02:02:53,729 --> 02:02:59,519
leaf on it for ya a poster for the show

2599
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:01,110
or for the fair I find entertaining

2600
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,909
well people from out of town find it

2601
02:03:01,109 --> 02:03:05,130
fascinating bro they really do

2602
02:03:02,908 --> 02:03:06,988
people wanted I have a friend from New

2603
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:08,730
Mexico and he wanted my just my empty

2604
02:03:06,988 --> 02:03:09,649
packaging from a dispenser he's like I

2605
02:03:08,729 --> 02:03:11,129
just want to show this to my friends

2606
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:13,229
that's weird

2607
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:16,350
people want receipts just to take back

2608
02:03:13,229 --> 02:03:18,869
and showing people in a frame and [ __ ] I

2609
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:20,219
haven't I bought weed on the first I was

2610
02:03:18,869 --> 02:03:21,779
the first person I know I keep repeating

2611
02:03:20,219 --> 02:03:23,369
this I'm proud I was the first person to

2612
02:03:21,779 --> 02:03:26,429
buy recreational cannabis at the greener

2613
02:03:23,369 --> 02:03:27,988
side dispensary in Pueblo Colorado and I

2614
02:03:26,429 --> 02:03:29,489
still have the weed that I bought sealed

2615
02:03:27,988 --> 02:03:32,459
in the package that they sold it to me

2616
02:03:29,488 --> 02:03:37,468
and in which they sold it to me it's in

2617
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:40,489
that package still on my desk I marvel

2618
02:03:37,469 --> 02:03:50,219
at it once in a while I might one day

2619
02:03:40,488 --> 02:03:51,779
the novelty is wearing off would it be

2620
02:03:50,219 --> 02:03:53,429
illegal though or could I just sell it

2621
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:55,679
for a nostalgic well no in 10 years dude

2622
02:03:53,429 --> 02:03:57,449
you're like collectible I have the

2623
02:03:55,679 --> 02:04:00,569
receipt as well so I could keep it with

2624
02:03:57,448 --> 02:04:01,710
it good like put it all in a frame in 10

2625
02:04:00,569 --> 02:04:03,149
years we won't have to worry about me

2626
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:04,529
trying to sell that to somebody because

2627
02:04:03,149 --> 02:04:05,879
we'll just be able to I could ship it to

2628
02:04:04,529 --> 02:04:08,698
wherever and they won't carry like ashes

2629
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:15,510
we'd just be completely legal [ __ ]

2630
02:04:08,698 --> 02:04:18,408
weed in jar not gonna hurt anything

2631
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:18,409
that's the truth

2632
02:04:20,149 --> 02:04:31,698
we were going to talk about the dude

2633
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:37,289
that ADA that's weird

2634
02:04:31,698 --> 02:04:39,000
okay we should just I hate its if you're

2635
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:41,279
looking up it'll pop up and you can

2636
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,139
probably look all kinds of [ __ ] up on it

2637
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:47,340
and read about a lot of it but I don't I

2638
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:49,650
haven't done it so I don't wanna express

2639
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:52,110
alright we'll skip that we should

2640
02:04:49,649 --> 02:04:53,098
respect him and his family yeah you guys

2641
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:55,078
should read about that if you're

2642
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:56,429
interested the guy the guy that jumped

2643
02:04:55,078 --> 02:04:59,308
after he ate an edible it's kind of

2644
02:04:56,429 --> 02:05:03,090
weird it is being debated as the

2645
02:04:59,309 --> 02:05:06,480
possible the possible death from

2646
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:09,560
marijuana which I highly doubt I think

2647
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:12,889
some other things were

2648
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:15,800
affecting that [ __ ] so but I don't know

2649
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:17,329
enough to yeah and it's not on the

2650
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,710
website that I saw it on before it's

2651
02:05:17,329 --> 02:05:20,479
disappeared so I don't know what

2652
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:25,279
happened to it yes I was looking for it

2653
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:29,269
I find that it's gone yeah so we can

2654
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:32,479
talk about that I said I had a rant yes

2655
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:34,370
you did people in Colorado and I'm gonna

2656
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:38,359
get some hatreds a backlash but guys

2657
02:05:34,369 --> 02:05:40,909
stop shipping weed out of state oh my

2658
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:46,099
god please

2659
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:47,479
oh my god please but he's right there's

2660
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:48,710
a couple of things that suck about that

2661
02:05:47,479 --> 02:05:50,209
we worked hard

2662
02:05:48,710 --> 02:05:52,550
I can't I'm not gonna take any credit

2663
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:54,859
but the people that got this happening

2664
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:59,090
worked really hard to get cannabis

2665
02:05:54,859 --> 02:06:01,489
legalized for us and we're shipping it

2666
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:02,930
to plate were low on weed because we

2667
02:06:01,489 --> 02:06:05,229
have medical there are medical patients

2668
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:08,990
that are not getting cannabis because

2669
02:06:05,229 --> 02:06:11,179
the shops have more profit by selling it

2670
02:06:08,989 --> 02:06:12,439
recreationally so there are medical

2671
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:13,820
patients that are now not getting their

2672
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:16,579
weed I've ranted about this on another

2673
02:06:13,819 --> 02:06:18,349
episode but that weed that you're

2674
02:06:16,579 --> 02:06:20,269
growing could go to somebody in Colorado

2675
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:23,240
that needs some medical weed instead of

2676
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:24,560
somebody in a state five states away

2677
02:06:23,239 --> 02:06:26,029
that just wants to make a little bit

2678
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:27,560
more money and you're making more money

2679
02:06:26,029 --> 02:06:29,989
off that pound that you're shipping I

2680
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:34,400
think about that and it's not worth

2681
02:06:29,989 --> 02:06:35,779
[ __ ] up what we've worked for and

2682
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:37,699
you're gonna get busted eventually

2683
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:39,229
they're they're gonna start this is my

2684
02:06:37,699 --> 02:06:40,670
prediction just like they're pulling

2685
02:06:39,229 --> 02:06:42,109
people over out of state with Colorado

2686
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:43,489
plates they're gonna start oh this came

2687
02:06:42,109 --> 02:06:45,170
from Colorado and they're gonna start

2688
02:06:43,489 --> 02:06:46,729
cutting open boxes yeah

2689
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:49,819
if nothing else they're just gonna take

2690
02:06:46,729 --> 02:06:53,329
your [ __ ] if it's somebody you know it's

2691
02:06:49,819 --> 02:06:55,159
some young dude that's ambitious [ __ ] if

2692
02:06:53,329 --> 02:06:57,439
it's some old guy or some snooty old

2693
02:06:55,159 --> 02:06:59,059
ladies from church Lee your box smells

2694
02:06:57,439 --> 02:07:00,500
like reefer and says Colorado she's

2695
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:02,720
gonna do what she can to find out what's

2696
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:05,090
in there so I guess eventually you'll

2697
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:06,050
get yours you'll get your but bad karma

2698
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:07,610
will come to you I don't wish it upon

2699
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:12,230
you but it'll happen dude and I don't

2700
02:07:07,609 --> 02:07:13,939
want I don't want on the community and

2701
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:16,039
the movement not just the individual

2702
02:07:13,939 --> 02:07:18,799
yeah yeah and we don't need more

2703
02:07:16,039 --> 02:07:21,128
cannabis leaving Colorado it's hard

2704
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,748
enough to keep Colorado supplied

2705
02:07:21,128 --> 02:07:25,149
in a couple of years that won't be a

2706
02:07:22,748 --> 02:07:26,738
problem we got everybody's got gigantic

2707
02:07:25,149 --> 02:07:32,559
plans and everyone's building [ __ ]

2708
02:07:26,738 --> 02:07:34,268
greenhouses but yeah don't ship it come

2709
02:07:32,559 --> 02:07:35,889
here if you want to drive home with it

2710
02:07:34,269 --> 02:07:37,269
if you want to drive it somewhere I

2711
02:07:35,889 --> 02:07:39,368
don't even encourage you driving

2712
02:07:37,269 --> 02:07:40,840
quantity somewhere keep it in Colorado

2713
02:07:39,368 --> 02:07:43,958
get it to a patient that needs it

2714
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:47,078
patients will pay as well like you don't

2715
02:07:43,958 --> 02:07:48,969
need to make an arm and a leg I know how

2716
02:07:47,078 --> 02:07:50,648
much weed you should be producing

2717
02:07:48,969 --> 02:07:51,698
through a thousand watt light most of

2718
02:07:50,649 --> 02:07:53,349
you guys don't know how much light

2719
02:07:51,698 --> 02:07:56,078

2730
02:08:16,179 --> 02:08:39,550
at the shop and I give knowledge that

2731
02:08:36,939 --> 02:08:41,320
part of it being able to sit and answer

2732
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:43,899
questions for people and give them

2733
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:47,078
cannabis knowledge and let them know how

2734
02:08:43,899 --> 02:08:51,099
it'll help them or what might be better

2735
02:08:47,078 --> 02:08:53,188
for them or why this is really neat to

2736
02:08:51,099 --> 02:08:58,179
see someone come in they may as never

2737
02:08:53,189 --> 02:09:00,699
may have never had cannabis before but

2738
02:08:58,179 --> 02:09:02,378
had read some stuff about it and you

2739
02:09:00,698 --> 02:09:03,998
know had decided to give it a try and

2740
02:09:02,378 --> 02:09:06,639
they come in very uncomfortable and

2741
02:09:03,998 --> 02:09:08,198
unsure and uneasy which if you don't

2742
02:09:06,639 --> 02:09:12,998
know much about anything you're gonna be

2743
02:09:08,198 --> 02:09:15,038
like that with any kind of new thing and

2744
02:09:12,998 --> 02:09:16,628
then after by the time they leave and

2745
02:09:15,038 --> 02:09:19,300
after I answer their questions and stuff

2746
02:09:16,628 --> 02:09:20,948
it's really nice that they they kind of

2747
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:22,748
they're much more comfortable they're

2748
02:09:20,948 --> 02:09:24,788
happy they're enthused

2749
02:09:22,748 --> 02:09:28,538
they're already feeling better they

2750
02:09:24,788 --> 02:09:30,550
haven't even had any medicine yet and

2751
02:09:28,538 --> 02:09:32,288
part of that is just spiritual uplifting

2752
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:33,579
that's really good for people and that's

2753
02:09:32,288 --> 02:09:35,170
good for your karma too bro so you

2806
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:12,619
down a little bit but still give them a

2807
02:13:05,239 --> 02:13:14,750

rinkle interesting there's other people

2817
02:13:44,408 --> 02:14:00,219
there like sounds like cheese I don't

2818
02:13:46,630 --> 02:14:01,750
like that particular flavors they tell

2819
02:14:00,219 --> 02:14:03,639
me what kind of a high they want or what

2820
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:05,198
they're looking for mainly and I'll pull

2821
02:14:03,639 --> 02:14:06,159
out three or four different strains and

2822
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:08,529
they'll be like well what's the

2823
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:10,598
difference and they'll all be similar in

2824
02:14:08,529 --> 02:14:12,130
the high that they get but they'll be so

2825
02:14:10,599 --> 02:14:15,159
different in their flavor and smell

2826
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:17,250
profiles I'm just like everyone smells

2827
02:14:15,158 --> 02:14:19,750
the best to you that's the one you want

2828
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:21,130
maybe that's kind of a neat I do that

2829
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:23,738

our nose it follow the nose that always

2831
02:14:23,738 --> 02:14:27,518
knows maybe maybe your body is like that

02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:29,860
one right there's got to stuff you need

2833
02:14:27,519 --> 02:14:31,989
because you know we've liked the sound

2834
02:14:29,859 --> 02:14:35,170
diesel a lot and it works medicinally

2835
02:14:31,988 --> 02:14:41,259
very well that's not a medicinal plant

2836
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:45,940

2932
02:19:59,859 --> 02:20:09,568

some really active sounding intestines

2934
02:20:09,568 --> 02:20:16,478
we want to elaborate too much on its

2935
02:20:14,559 --> 02:20:18,670
rerouting inside of him from some

2936
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:22,219
childhood things but he's sometimes he

2937
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:30,840
sounds like a freaking drainage system

3051
02:28:34,050 --> 02:28:39,579
I've heard that it came from students in

3052
02:28:36,909 --> 02:28:40,601
Harvard or Yale where they would go that

3053
02:28:39,579 --> 02:28:42,220
would be the time that they would get

3054
02:28:40,601 --> 02:28:45,940
out of school and they would go and

3055
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:48,129
smoke and it just affiliated from there

3081
02:30:15,329 --> 02:30:18,750
gonna give thanks to the Waldos because

3082
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,670
those guys coined something that is

3083
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:21,329
lasted forever it's become integral to

3084
02:30:20,670 --> 02:30:23,819
the scene

3085
02:30:21,329 --> 02:30:25,260

trying to go somewhere 420 friendly is a

3088
02:30:27,629 --> 02:30:34,350
common phrase we're having the Cannabis

3089

Cup on 4/20 that's how it's raised you

3090
02:30:34,351 --> 02:30:41,641

3091
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:43,620
in the community you can use smoke that

3092
02:30:41,640 --> 02:30:46,379

random topic

3116
02:31:48,129 --> 02:31:50,828
know how to say it because both you were

3117
02:31:49,629 --> 02:32:04,658
just giving me [ __ ] about how I say

3118
02:31:50,828 --> 02:32:06,458
Pueblo okay that all of us hippies like

3119
02:32:04,658 --> 02:32:08,488
to put on [ __ ] almost everything we

3120
02:32:06,459 --> 02:32:10,959
eat I've heard of it I've never date

3121
02:32:08,488 --> 02:32:13,988
sriracha factory in Irwindale California

3122
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:16,779
has been recently declared a public

3123
02:32:13,988 --> 02:32:18,609
nuisance by Irwindale City Council yeah

3124
02:32:16,779 --> 02:32:20,109
yeah I think it's funny because it

3125
02:32:18,609 --> 02:32:22,568
relates to the Denver topic when people

3126
02:32:20,109 --> 02:32:24,488
were complaining about weed smells the

3127
02:32:22,568 --> 02:32:26,260
pungent pepper fumes burned locals eyes

3128
02:32:24,488 --> 02:32:28,510
and throat and causes respiratory issues

3129
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:30,158
holy Fong foods open the plant two years

3130
02:32:28,510 --> 02:32:35,590
ago and they've been working to minimize

3131
02:32:30,158 --> 02:32:38,020
odors they have 90 days to correct the

3132
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:40,630
issue this could lead to a shortage of

3133
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:46,328
my favorite rooster sauce bro we can't

3134
02:32:40,629 --> 02:32:51,938
let this happen to get their [ __ ]

3135
02:32:46,328 --> 02:32:53,228
together and make it not stink yeah once

3136
02:32:51,939 --> 02:32:54,760
you write him and recommend amended

3137
02:32:53,228 --> 02:32:56,438
carbon filter it's gonna take some

3138
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:57,309
industrial-strength [ __ ] they claim to

3139
02:32:56,439 --> 02:32:58,630
have it under control

3140
02:32:57,309 --> 02:33:00,549
but I thought that was interesting that

3141
02:32:58,629 --> 02:33:01,478
the neighbors are complaining it's if

3142
02:33:00,549 --> 02:33:06,188
they feel like they're getting tear

3143
02:33:01,478 --> 02:33:10,719
gassed all day over there [ __ ] a

3144
02:33:06,189 --> 02:33:13,300
discount on my [ __ ] rent well your

3145
02:33:10,719 --> 02:33:17,260
landlord didn't do it so that's part of

3146
02:33:13,299 --> 02:33:18,938
the problem was it really that big of a

3147
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:21,398
problem in Denver when it first started

3148
02:33:18,939 --> 02:33:22,840
that it was it was that apparent like

3149
02:33:21,398 --> 02:33:24,519
you couldn't go downtown anywhere

3150
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:25,539
without smelling pop there were certain

3151
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:27,908
neighborhoods like there's a little

3152
02:33:25,539 --> 02:33:30,760
commercial area it's like a commercial

3153
02:33:27,908 --> 02:33:33,578
industrial area that's where all the

3154
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:35,139
warehouses are oh it just stinks like

3155
02:33:33,578 --> 02:33:36,908
you can I could smell it and I don't

3156
02:33:35,139 --> 02:33:39,698
even notice the smell of weed in some

3157
02:33:36,908 --> 02:33:42,399
places when I walk into dispensaries oh

3158
02:33:39,699 --> 02:33:46,230
it smells so good in here

3159
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:49,119
like describe it yeah I'm immune I guess

3160
02:33:46,229 --> 02:33:50,619
all right so nobody was interested in

3161
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:54,150
the sriracha story at the table here

3162
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:54,150
maybe this will get somebody's attention

3163
02:33:57,870 --> 02:34:03,851
use that hot sauce a lot so there was

3164
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:05,140
recently you guys got to pay attention

3165
02:34:03,851 --> 02:34:07,150

3166
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:08,079
Oh your microphones gonna fall out of

3167

cases of child abuse or neglect in the

3175
02:34:38,409 --> 02:34:46,780
children's code what they're trying to

3176
02:34:42,851 --> 02:34:49,271
do what they're attempting to do is they

3177
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:50,950
want to there are no rules in place if

3178
02:34:49,271 --> 02:34:52,271
they come into your house and you're

3179
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:55,811
doing drugs in the house and there's a

3180
02:34:52,271 --> 02:34:57,761
child there there aren't rules that

3181
02:34:55,810 --> 02:34:59,829
there are vague rules and things but

3182
02:34:57,761 --> 02:35:02,771
they're trying to make it they're trying

3183
02:34:59,829 --> 02:35:05,440
to put like definitely a street codes

3184
02:35:02,771 --> 02:35:06,851
rules I'll read from it'll say it'll

3185
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:08,739
make more sense but controlled

3186

Services family courts and the criminal

3198
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:35,649
justice system currently do not have a

3199
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:36,790
common definition of a drug in danger

3200
02:35:35,649 --> 02:35:38,529
child that's what I was trying to

3201
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:41,261
stumble into but dads are [ __ ] making

3202
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:43,391
it clogged law enforcement agencies have

3203
02:35:41,261 --> 02:35:44,739
Human Services and statutory mandated

3204
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:47,289
reporters of suspected child

3205
02:35:44,739 --> 02:35:49,630
maltreatment need common tools and

3206
02:35:47,290 --> 02:35:51,011
training well I [ __ ] all that up

3207
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:53,109
trying to say it but these guys need

3208
02:35:51,011 --> 02:35:55,450
common tools and training to identify a

3209
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:57,431
child at risk of abuse and neglect

3210
02:35:55,450 --> 02:35:59,440
as a result of the EU's production and

3211
02:35:57,431 --> 02:36:01,840
distribution of drugs in a child

3212
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:03,130
environment this goes on and on and on

3213
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:04,659
and on and there are a few things that

3214
02:36:03,129 --> 02:36:07,680
kind of pissed off a lot of people in

3215
02:36:04,659 --> 02:36:10,869
Colorado got some feathers ruffled here

3216
02:36:07,681 --> 02:36:12,730
drugged endangered child means any child

3217
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:15,311
in a case in which any of the following

3218
02:36:12,729 --> 02:36:18,459
situations occur the presence of a child

3219
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:20,529
or on the premises where a child is

3220
02:36:18,459 --> 02:36:24,279
found or resides a controlled substance

3221
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:25,271
is defined in Section 1818 - 102 there's

3222
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:27,280
a lot of stuff here that's gonna sound

3223
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:29,110
ridiculous to you guys but there's a

3224
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:31,960
there three words here manufactured

3225
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:35,079
distributed distributed cultivated

3226
02:36:31,959 --> 02:36:38,409
cultivated is aiming at us at growing

3227
02:36:35,079 --> 02:36:39,819
growing at marijuana users and there are

3228
02:36:38,409 --> 02:36:42,129
also other things in this in the

3229
02:36:39,819 --> 02:36:44,709
language that will come back to bite

3230
02:36:42,129 --> 02:36:47,049
cannabis users medical marijuana

3231
02:36:44,709 --> 02:36:48,489
patients growers smokers this will come

3232
02:36:47,049 --> 02:36:52,180
to bite us in our ass first of all

3233
02:36:48,489 --> 02:36:54,219
because well can I mention that you've

3234
02:36:52,181 --> 02:36:55,300
got kids and they know because that's

3235
02:36:54,219 --> 02:36:57,340
kind of why I bar not brought you on

3236
02:36:55,299 --> 02:36:59,109
this episode when I said this you got

3237
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:01,090
pissed because well tell me I'll let you

3238
02:36:59,110 --> 02:37:10,391
just moved here from this is my friend

3239
02:37:01,090 --> 02:37:11,681
Adam by the way anything pretty much

3240
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:13,270
east of the Mississippi unless you're

3241
02:37:11,681 --> 02:37:17,230
North in Michigan and things like that

3242
02:37:13,271 --> 02:37:18,641
DC it's it's it's not even relevant like

3243
02:37:17,229 --> 02:37:20,260
there's no shops you know a lot of the

3244
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:22,149
lot of the states even Florida where I'm

3245
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:24,280
from is starting to look towards medical

3246
02:37:22,149 --> 02:37:26,440
medicalization but it's still gonna take

3247
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:28,870
three years to pass all the [ __ ]

3248
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:31,649
gray lines and to even place it into law

3249
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:33,670
so before it gets rolling around I mean

3250
02:37:31,649 --> 02:37:36,520
when I left there they were still

3251
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:38,649
writing laws saying if you had more than

3252
02:37:36,521 --> 02:37:40,659
three sprouted seeds then your ass is

3253
02:37:38,649 --> 02:37:43,931
going to jail for four Colts for

3254
02:37:40,659 --> 02:37:46,299
cultivation but that's that's not it

3255
02:37:43,931 --> 02:37:47,560
it's it's more along lines of the dabs

3256
02:37:46,299 --> 02:37:48,969
are really making this hardener that's

3257
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:50,860
right that's right everyone else's dab

3258
02:37:48,969 --> 02:37:52,930
down listening to so you came here to

3259
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:55,739
Colorado to get away from going on

3260
02:37:52,931 --> 02:37:58,329
prison for having three sprouted seeds

3261
02:37:55,739 --> 02:38:00,819
it's absolutely having cannabis freedom

3262
02:37:58,329 --> 02:38:03,700
having the ability to come here and as a

3263
02:38:00,819 --> 02:38:05,229
legal adult who follows the laws I

3264
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:06,641
should be able to grow my six plants now

3265
02:38:05,229 --> 02:38:07,189
they're saying if I follow the laws then

3266
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:09,829
I'll have no

3267
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:14,180
but they're also saying that if I'm

3268
02:38:09,829 --> 02:38:15,530
using marijuana once is cultivated if

3269
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:16,880
you're cultivating marijuana in your

3270
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:18,409
backyard and your child lives there

3271
02:38:16,879 --> 02:38:21,709
you've got an in danger a drug

3272
02:38:18,409 --> 02:38:23,810
endangered child you know that's that's

3273
02:38:21,709 --> 02:38:25,729
hard because I just moved here and got

3274
02:38:23,810 --> 02:38:30,049
my med card and they thought you were

3275
02:38:25,729 --> 02:38:32,359
cool right I'm cool and now you said

3276
02:38:30,049 --> 02:38:33,770
earlier that this is strictly Colorado's

3277
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:35,690
as a Colorado ville yes is this the

3278
02:38:33,771 --> 02:38:38,450
Colorado bill so this isn't anywhere

3279
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:41,030
else I just moved here to get away from

3280
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:43,880
the stimula I mean I've I've had issues

3281
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:46,010
where me and her have had arguments and

3282
02:38:43,879 --> 02:38:48,049
then DCF is in our life just like they

3283
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:49,909
have to be oh yeah yeah they step in for

3284
02:38:48,049 --> 02:38:51,979
45 days or however long they give us a

3285
02:38:49,909 --> 02:38:53,810
piss test they make sure they come by a

3286
02:38:51,979 --> 02:38:56,000
couple times they ask the kids they see

3287
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:58,610
this you know everything's good we've

3288
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,860
had no problems beyond that but what

3289
02:38:58,610 --> 02:39:01,310
it's been always is if you can pee in

3290
02:39:00,860 --> 02:39:04,010
this Cup

3291
02:39:01,310 --> 02:39:05,449
and it the line isn't there it always

3292
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:07,640
what it's been and if the lines there

3293
02:39:05,450 --> 02:39:09,800
then we're gonna have a problem and now

3294
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:11,719
they're saying that oh no go ahead move

3295
02:39:09,799 --> 02:39:14,000
out there and I packed my family up and

3296
02:39:11,719 --> 02:39:16,129
moved 1,200 miles to come out here and

3297
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,260
then now you're you know three months

3298
02:39:16,129 --> 02:39:21,039
into it it's they're gonna pass a law

3299
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:23,750
and saying I can't cultivate you know

3300
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:26,450
six plants in the backyard where I

3301
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:27,920
follow everything state law wide you

3302
02:39:26,450 --> 02:39:30,351
know I don't I don't have the plants in

3303
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:32,090
the backyard right now but I moved here

3304
02:39:30,351 --> 02:39:34,819
in the promise that's what I'm doing

3305
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:38,540
this year that's so there was an

3306
02:39:34,819 --> 02:39:39,560
amendment to this bill it says and I'm

3307
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:41,180
gonna skip some of the technical

3308
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:43,159
partners cuz it bores our listeners and

3309
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:45,079
it makes me stumble nothing in this part

3310
02:39:43,159 --> 02:39:47,149
for shall prohibit the use possession

3311
02:39:45,079 --> 02:39:48,440
cultivation distribution or manufacture

3312
02:39:47,149 --> 02:39:50,629
of a controlled substance that is

3313
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:52,880
permitted by Colorado law and that is

3314
02:39:50,629 --> 02:39:54,890
used possessed cultivated distributed or

3315
02:39:52,879 --> 02:39:57,350
manufactured in accordance with Colorado

3316
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:59,750
law in a situation that does not pose a

3317
02:39:57,351 --> 02:40:03,340
threat of injury to a child's life or

3318
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:07,819
health so they are vaguely trying to

3319
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:09,710
help us out but the why do I still feel

3320
02:40:07,819 --> 02:40:12,680
like this is pointed toward smokers well

3321
02:40:09,709 --> 02:40:15,079
the legal growth that guides me with my

3322
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:17,060
little bit of my legal ideas they got me

3323
02:40:15,079 --> 02:40:18,530
onto this here want to talk about it he

3324
02:40:17,060 --> 02:40:20,239
says that's not enough he says it's

3325
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:20,820
still the way that it's worded we are

3326
02:40:20,239 --> 02:40:22,590
still gonna

3327
02:40:20,819 --> 02:40:24,360
boned in the butt is essentially what is

3328
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:28,440
saying prescription pills what about

3329
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:30,239
alcohol a little bit differently but

3330
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:32,790
he's more taught this is more aimed at

3331
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,021
like meth labs and weed grows and that

3332
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,400
sort of thing because the things you're

3333
02:40:34,021 --> 02:40:38,601
aiming for are regulated by other

3334
02:40:35,399 --> 02:40:41,789
entities I'm all down with you know

3335
02:40:38,601 --> 02:40:43,261
tackling down on the meth labs there's

3336
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:44,761
no way to do it so that's part of what

3337
02:40:43,261 --> 02:40:46,409
this is gonna do but in the mix we're

3338
02:40:44,761 --> 02:40:48,690
getting caught in there mm-hmm they were

3339
02:40:46,409 --> 02:40:49,920
to put us to [ __ ] us up in there so I'm

3340
02:40:48,690 --> 02:40:51,420
scrolling through this guy's Facebook

3341
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:53,970
page because I had the page to where I

3342
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:56,250
could find the the people's email

3343
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:57,689
addresses that we need to email so that

3344
02:40:56,250 --> 02:41:03,379
we can try to stop this crap from

3345
02:40:57,690 --> 02:41:06,271
happening I don't I don't have kids but

3346
02:41:03,379 --> 02:41:09,420
my issue with this thing is there's

3347
02:41:06,271 --> 02:41:11,851
there are a lot of new studies with with

3348
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:13,829
cannabis helping a lot of children and a

3349
02:41:11,851 --> 02:41:18,960
lot of families moving here to help

3350
02:41:13,829 --> 02:41:21,989
their children for all kinds of things

3351
02:41:18,959 --> 02:41:25,229
and so how are you gonna make this bill

3352
02:41:21,989 --> 02:41:27,271
that they can't cultivate medicine that

3353
02:41:25,229 --> 02:41:29,520
their child needs that's gonna be

3354
02:41:27,271 --> 02:41:31,739
endangering them saving life is going to

3355
02:41:29,521 --> 02:41:33,980
be endangering them I think that's a

3356
02:41:31,739 --> 02:41:38,239
very completely hypocritical bill

3357
02:41:33,979 --> 02:41:42,270
completely you have multi million viewed

3358
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:46,440
videos and such things on in SMBC

3359
02:41:42,271 --> 02:41:48,989
on people doing moving here Marines and

3360
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:50,700
and and homemaker don't even use

3361
02:41:48,989 --> 02:41:52,351
marijuana that are moving here just to

3362
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:53,880
cultivate it yeah and I mean I would

3363
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:55,471
understand that this law would not even

3364
02:41:53,879 --> 02:41:56,339
threaten him is what somebody would say

3365
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:58,229
who was in power

3366
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:59,280
oh this they would have nothing to worry

3367
02:41:58,229 --> 02:42:01,109
about that because they would be under

3368
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:02,431
accordance by state law obviously

3369
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:03,960
they're not there to do it illegally

3370
02:42:02,431 --> 02:42:06,360
we're just going after the illegal

3371
02:42:03,959 --> 02:42:08,909
people but how many times well with this

3372
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:10,380

02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:56,600
she lives with her mom because uh

3395
02:42:55,129 --> 02:42:57,979
because partially because of what I do

3396
02:42:56,601 --> 02:43:00,409
because I think it's better to have her

3397
02:42:57,979 --> 02:43:05,359
there I feel a little doesn't need to be

3398
02:43:00,409 --> 02:43:07,761
around my weed life she's a child if she

3399
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:09,530
were to come here to the house and I

3400
02:43:07,761 --> 02:43:10,579
happen to have I wonder if my seeds

3401
02:43:09,530 --> 02:43:12,500
would count you know what I mean

3402
02:43:10,579 --> 02:43:16,550
absolutely if they were if they were

3403
02:43:12,500 --> 02:43:17,959
popped some seeds in a bag what if the

3404
02:43:16,550 --> 02:43:20,209
rig sitting here right here on the table

3405
02:43:17,959 --> 02:43:21,739
what if me and the kid come in and we

3406
02:43:20,209 --> 02:43:23,029
walk in and the rigs just sitting there

3407
02:43:21,739 --> 02:43:24,560
on the table if she's suddenly a drug

3408
02:43:23,030 --> 02:43:26,601
endanger child because the rigs on the

3409
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:28,789
table and you know what else edibles

3410
02:43:26,601 --> 02:43:30,590
they're really hunting on edibles right

3411
02:43:28,790 --> 02:43:32,471
now they're shaped like candies and

3412
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:35,210
things like that you know if you had the

3413
02:43:32,470 --> 02:43:37,579
table is that a drug endanger child in

3414
02:43:35,209 --> 02:43:40,970
my mind that qualifies because that's

3415
02:43:37,579 --> 02:43:42,890
[ __ ] up you failed your that's your

3416
02:43:40,970 --> 02:43:43,939
medical marijuana brownie or cookie

3417
02:43:42,890 --> 02:43:45,319
should be treated just like your

3418
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:47,271
percocets your vicodins your heart

3419
02:43:45,319 --> 02:43:51,440
medication with you so that is a drug

3420
02:43:47,271 --> 02:43:52,851
endanger child in my opinion and I gotta

3421
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:54,620
support some kind of control of some

3422
02:43:52,851 --> 02:44:04,940
kind of law like I love kids I got my

3423
02:43:54,620 --> 02:44:10,250
own kid if if you supported we have to

3424
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:17,601
also support regulation it also has to

3425
02:44:10,250 --> 02:44:19,431
be reasonable regulation so much and

3426
02:44:17,601 --> 02:44:22,040
then they're like struggling to catch

3427
02:44:19,431 --> 02:44:25,780
back up they do the definitions after

3428
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:25,780
they make the regulations marches

3429
02:44:27,670 --> 02:44:31,970
written it's been passed on or it's been

3430
02:44:30,351 --> 02:44:35,000
amended and then it's been passed on to

02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:09,329
those who see this situation as a

3564
02:52:06,239 --> 02:52:11,250
contradictory is Miguel Lopez the 4/20

3565

weekends advised organizer who applied

3566
02:52:11,250 --> 02:52:25,319
for the right to sell beer in the first

3567
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:27,720
place that's just the first basic

3568
02:52:25,319 --> 02:52:29,399
question it says the beer and liquor

3569
02:52:27,719 --> 02:52:31,140
will not be allowed outside the

3570

McNichols building during the two-day

3571
02:52:31,140 --> 02:52:36,359
event ok people can't just get it and go

3572
02:52:34,379 --> 02:52:48,539
outside it's in a controlled area is

3573
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:50,400
actually what it says yeah they're

3574
02:52:48,540 --> 02:52:52,950
trying to discourage us from smoking pot

3575
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:54,719
and giving us booze yeah so let's see

3576
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:56,990
make it more and I'm not hoping for bad

3577
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:59,640
[ __ ] I'm really hoping it goes well but

3578
02:52:56,989 --> 02:53:01,949
let's see if duis increase let's see if

3579
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:12,329
there's problems it's a perfect it's a

3580
02:53:01,950 --> 02:53:14,641
perfect case study right here where they

3581
02:53:12,329 --> 02:53:16,590

3582
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:18,209
behind the wheel hi and in most the

3583
02:53:16,590 --> 02:53:20,250
times it came out they had a higher

3584
02:53:18,209 --> 02:53:23,069
percentage of like staying in they were

3585
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:24,750
more aware I would believe you I haven't

02:57:41,659 --> 02:57:45,500
small study of casual marijuana smokers

3673
02:57:43,639 --> 02:57:48,079
has turned up evidence of changes in the

3674
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:50,629
brain a possible sign of trouble head

3675
02:57:48,079 --> 02:57:52,039
reaches and researchers say the young

3676
02:57:50,629 --> 02:57:54,049
adults who volunteered for the study

3677
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:56,510
were not dependent on pot nor did they

3678
02:57:54,049 --> 02:57:58,250
show any marijuana related problems well

3679
02:57:56,510 --> 02:58:00,290
we think we're seeing here is a very

3680
02:57:58,250 --> 02:58:02,228
early indication of what becomes a

3681
02:58:00,290 --> 02:58:04,729
problem later on with prolonged use

3682
02:58:02,228 --> 02:58:07,340
things like lack of focus and impaired

3683
02:58:04,728 --> 02:58:09,909
judgments and dr. hands brighter that's

3684
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:12,170
gotta be a German name a study author

3685
02:58:09,909 --> 02:58:13,969
longer term studies will be needed to

3686
02:58:12,170 --> 02:58:17,930
see if such brain changes cause any

3687
02:58:13,969 --> 02:58:19,369
symptoms over time like how long we've

3688
02:58:17,930 --> 02:58:28,120
been smoking weed for a hundred

3689
02:58:19,370 --> 02:58:30,860
something years there's you've seen the

3690
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:32,300
cannabinoid receptors we have brain you

3691
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:34,250
don't see that's that's been found in

3692
02:58:32,299 --> 02:58:37,219
the past five years now that they just

3693
02:58:34,250 --> 02:58:38,840
opened research previous studies have

3694
02:58:37,219 --> 02:58:40,579
shown mixed results in looking for brain

3695
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:43,489
changes from marijuana use perhaps

3696
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:48,379
because of difference in the techniques

3697
02:58:43,489 --> 02:58:51,190
used in Wednesday's issue of the Journal

3698
02:58:48,379 --> 02:58:53,269
of Neuroscience what that makes me think

3699
02:58:51,190 --> 02:58:54,850
guess what he's thinking well they don't

3700
02:58:53,270 --> 02:58:56,720
know because they're not in the scene

3701
02:58:54,850 --> 02:58:59,020
Kem's looking at me like he knows what

3702
02:58:56,719 --> 02:59:01,399
I'm leading to it's the dabs bro

3703
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:03,200
concentrates and because the new

3704
02:59:01,399 --> 02:59:04,850
advanced ways of consuming all right the

3705
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:06,440
study is among the first to focus on

3706
02:59:04,850 --> 02:59:08,649
possible brain effects and recreational

3707
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:10,729
pot smokers said dr. Nora Volkow

3708
02:59:08,649 --> 02:59:13,010
director of the National Institute on

3709
02:59:10,728 --> 02:59:14,269
Drug Abuse the federal agency helped pay

3710
02:59:13,010 --> 02:59:16,639
for the work she called the work

3711
02:59:14,270 --> 02:59:18,200
important but preliminary the twenty pot

3712
02:59:16,639 --> 02:59:19,489
users in the study ages eighteen to

3713
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:22,100
twenty five said they smoked marijuana

3714
02:59:19,489 --> 02:59:24,289
an average of about four days a week for

3715
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:26,930
an average of average total of about

3716
02:59:24,290 --> 02:59:28,970
eleven joints half of them smoked fewer

3717
02:59:26,930 --> 02:59:30,500
than six joints a week researchers scan

3718
02:59:28,969 --> 02:59:32,390
their brains and compared the results of

3719
02:59:30,500 --> 02:59:34,761
those twenty non-users

3720
02:59:32,390 --> 02:59:36,529
compared those results to 29 users who

3721
02:59:34,761 --> 02:59:38,960
were matched of age sex and other traits

3722
02:59:36,530 --> 02:59:41,030
the results showed differences in two

3723
02:59:38,959 --> 02:59:48,350
brain areas associated with emotion and

3724
02:59:41,030 --> 02:59:53,271
motivation yeah a part of the brain and

3725
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:55,431
the nucleus a kyumin's user showed

3726
02:59:53,271 --> 02:59:58,250
higher density than non users as well as

3727
02:59:55,431 --> 03:00:00,351
different differences in shape of those

3728
02:59:58,250 --> 03:00:02,300
areas both differences were more

3729
03:00:00,351 --> 03:00:08,540
pronounced and those who reported

3730
03:00:02,300 --> 03:00:10,310
smoking more marijuana doctor also said

3731
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:12,261
large studies are needed to explore

3732
03:00:10,310 --> 03:00:14,479
whether casual to moderate marijuana use

3733
03:00:12,261 --> 03:00:16,729
really does cause anatomical brain

3734
03:00:14,479 --> 03:00:19,100
changes and if so whether that leads to

3735
03:00:16,729 --> 03:00:20,600
any impairment the current work doesn't

3736
03:00:19,101 --> 03:00:22,040
determine whether casual to moderate

3737
03:00:20,601 --> 03:00:25,880
marijuana use is harmful to the brain

3738
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:28,820
she said so we can see changes but we

3739
03:00:25,879 --> 03:00:31,250
don't know if it's harmful yet casual to

3740
03:00:28,819 --> 03:00:33,229
moderate I would say maybe maybe you

3741
03:00:31,250 --> 03:00:34,940
really got high four times a week that

3742
03:00:33,229 --> 03:00:37,129
would be casual with Monica you know I'm

3743
03:00:34,940 --> 03:00:40,011
saying like somebody had it like you

3744
03:00:37,129 --> 03:00:42,800
didn't buy anything like that or just

3745
03:00:40,011 --> 03:00:45,170
when somebody had you know and you

3746
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:46,640
smoked what they had that would be that

3747
03:00:45,170 --> 03:00:50,000
would be acceptable casual moderate

3748
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:53,479
anything besides that your user and you

3749
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:56,329
you use it to get that that chemical

3750
03:00:53,479 --> 03:01:06,829
change you know I mean I dude I don't we

3751
03:00:56,329 --> 03:01:09,379
answer smoke some Sour Diesel I can't

3752
03:01:06,829 --> 03:01:10,851
see it now I'll think I'm gonna smoke a

3753
03:01:09,379 --> 03:01:12,379
bowl and watch a movie or something else

3754
03:01:10,851 --> 03:01:17,780
our diesel ended up doing the damn

3755
03:01:12,379 --> 03:01:20,629
dishes I feel like I mean soon as I get

3756
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:24,530
high I mean I'm not that lazy stoner you

3757
03:01:20,629 --> 03:01:25,729
know we're all three here though there

3758
03:01:24,530 --> 03:01:31,521
are a bunch of people that are not here

3759
03:01:25,729 --> 03:01:36,920
because their garden you like to be well

3760
03:01:31,521 --> 03:01:38,721
oh yeah that way it gets you you're not

3761
03:01:36,920 --> 03:01:39,779
sidetracked with this you're you're

3762
03:01:38,720 --> 03:01:42,559
focusing on one

3763
03:01:39,779 --> 03:01:44,819
at a time you know I feel that same way

3764
03:01:42,559 --> 03:01:47,309
doing construction and stuff down there

3765
03:01:44,818 --> 03:01:49,350
and Florida man we [ __ ] baked all day

3766
03:01:47,309 --> 03:01:51,118
[ __ ] you superintended you're sitting in

3767
03:01:49,350 --> 03:01:52,890
your truck while I'm blowing down and

3768
03:01:51,119 --> 03:01:58,520
setting trusses what are you gonna do

3769
03:01:52,889 --> 03:02:01,318
climb up here and get me fat boy reason

3770
03:01:58,520 --> 03:02:04,520
it was it I've never been that type of

3771
03:02:01,318 --> 03:02:05,969
person to really smoke and be

3772
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:07,738
unmotivated

3773
03:02:05,969 --> 03:02:09,510
you know like I I could definitely see

3774
03:02:07,738 --> 03:02:10,828
it you know if it's just me and her

3775
03:02:09,510 --> 03:02:16,289
sitting there in the house we don't have

3776
03:02:10,828 --> 03:02:17,520
anything to do yeah yeah all right well

3777
03:02:16,289 --> 03:02:18,930
they continue to say the effects of

3778
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:21,029
marijuana can occur much earlier than

3779
03:02:18,930 --> 03:02:22,770
previously saw some of the effect may

3780
03:02:21,029 --> 03:02:24,569
depend on a person to age when marijuana

3781
03:02:22,770 --> 03:02:26,488
use starts he said another brain

3782
03:02:24,568 --> 03:02:28,010
researcher of the state of University of

3783
03:02:26,488 --> 03:02:32,998
wisconsin-milwaukee

3784
03:02:28,010 --> 03:02:37,289
that's odd just one new state Wisconsin

3785
03:02:32,998 --> 03:02:40,708
Milwaukee no okay I'm dead I don't know

3786
03:02:37,289 --> 03:02:42,270
it's just all one word I am she sent her

3787
03:02:40,709 --> 03:02:43,799
own work has found similar results I

3788
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:45,119
think the clear message is we see brain

3789
03:02:43,799 --> 03:02:47,939
alterations before you develop

3790
03:02:45,119 --> 03:02:49,859
dependence so that says that uh your

3791
03:02:47,939 --> 03:02:51,869
brain is starting to change before we

3792
03:02:49,859 --> 03:02:54,328
notice that we're craving some dabs

3793
03:02:51,869 --> 03:02:56,399
again I don't know how you guys feel

3794
03:02:54,328 --> 03:02:58,609
about that article some of it seemed I

3795
03:02:56,398 --> 03:03:01,198
don't feel like as a kid

3796
03:02:58,609 --> 03:03:03,479
when I was young getting high it was it

3797
03:03:01,199 --> 03:03:05,699
was like oh I need to get high it was

3798
03:03:03,478 --> 03:03:09,448
all along the lines of when I could get

3799
03:03:05,699 --> 03:03:11,549
it and when came around you know I'm

3800
03:03:09,449 --> 03:03:14,399
talking sixteen seventeen living in

3801
03:03:11,549 --> 03:03:16,739
Gainesville Florida like it was

3802
03:03:14,398 --> 03:03:18,930
everywhere but it still wasn't

3803
03:03:16,738 --> 03:03:20,698
everywhere for a 17-year old you know

3804
03:03:18,930 --> 03:03:27,629
you had to have your skate rat friends

3805
03:03:20,699 --> 03:03:30,328
that you know older brother who you know

3806
03:03:27,629 --> 03:03:32,069
I'm saying I mean it's I don't know that

3807
03:03:30,328 --> 03:03:34,828
was years and years and years ago but

3808
03:03:32,068 --> 03:03:36,180
that's the way it was back then so glad

3809
03:03:34,828 --> 03:03:38,369
that I grew up in California it's where

3810
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:39,809
they're just always loved it I'm gonna

3811
03:03:38,369 --> 03:03:41,399
move to Colorado right at the right time

3812
03:03:39,809 --> 03:03:43,588
well I've been here for 20 years now but

3813
03:03:41,398 --> 03:03:46,048
I mean it was the right time in

3814
03:03:43,588 --> 03:03:47,129
California he's always like this is the

3815
03:03:46,049 --> 03:03:49,080
way it's been over

3816
03:03:47,129 --> 03:04:11,938
yeah he doesn't even know he's my age

3817
03:03:49,079 --> 03:04:14,689
and he's never and I'm like no no I

3818
03:04:11,939 --> 03:04:16,738
can't dude it's it's still there and I

3819
03:04:14,689 --> 03:04:19,949
feel like it's gonna be there for a

3820
03:04:16,738 --> 03:04:22,738
while it's something that I've grown up

3821
03:04:19,949 --> 03:04:28,290
with I mean it's great that I can sit in

3822
03:04:22,738 --> 03:04:30,118
my home and feel comfortable or right or

3823
03:04:28,290 --> 03:04:31,560
drive from point A to point B and not

3824
03:04:30,119 --> 03:04:33,840
worried about getting pulled over and

3825
03:04:31,559 --> 03:04:37,079
like yeah that's one of the best parts

3826
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:39,329
just rolled I've got to rip my dad rig

3827
03:04:37,079 --> 03:04:41,158
in the car and I'm cruising I think it's

3828
03:04:39,329 --> 03:04:43,770
pretty funny sometimes home I just

3829
03:04:41,158 --> 03:04:45,600
forget you know I'm like oh man a few

3830
03:04:43,770 --> 03:04:46,109
