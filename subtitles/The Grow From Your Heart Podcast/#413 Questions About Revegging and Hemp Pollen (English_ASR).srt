elite seeds dot-com it has become a

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
tradition that we start the podcast off

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,600
by talking about what I am smoking today

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,700
I've been taking dad's of Tropicana

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
cookies Fambrough Jie from our friends

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,989
at apothecary farms I picked this up at

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,669
the ambrosia days I was really lucky to

17
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,659
score a four gram jar of this amazing

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,870
concentrate the label says it contains

19
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:53,878
72.4% THC and a total of 85 percent

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,459
total cannabinoids this concentrate

21
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,780
tastes delicious I took a big chunky dad

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,219
it made me kind of sit back in the chair

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,259
for a couple of minutes but once that

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,978
initial punch to the face wore off this

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,239
got me in a really good mood

26
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:07,798
ladies and gentlemen in this episode I

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,809

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,579
this episode I was going to read some

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,549
listen or emails let's get right to it

45
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,739
this first email goes just like this it

46
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,509
says hey Jeff I wanted to start off by

47
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,789
saying that your podcasts are the best

48
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,560
hands down hey I appreciate that great

49
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,240
compliment thank you I do appreciate

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,340
hearing that people think I am the best

51
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,929
I'm not in it for competition but it

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,180
always feels good knowing that you're

53
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,979
winning then he says I've learned so

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,810
much hey I appreciate that I'm glad that

55
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,848
you're learning the message that goes on

56
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,039
to say so I have a question I am

57
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,709
starting my second grow using roots or

58
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,959
soil and canna viga organic supplements

59
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,579
which works great on my first grow hey

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,620
congrats on the first grow I'm glad that

61
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,590
worked out for you he continues to say I

62
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,420
am growing in a 4 foot by 3 foot by 6

63
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,819
foot tent with 2h LG v to 288 LED lights

64
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,068
alright so I got a good visual of your

65
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,628
setup that is a great way to diagnose a

66
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,378
problem or help me figure out what

67
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:38,878
you've got going on

68
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,169
give me a good description of your setup

69
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,479
I've got a good visual of what's

70
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,848
happening in this grow the message says

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,119
so I am growing to pineapple Express by

72
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,688
fast buds and one pink cush CBD by

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,719
seedsman

74
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:53,400
all are Auto flowers I was told by a few

75
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,400
people that it's not safe with my other

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,099
plants since this is a 30 to 1 CBD plant

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,560
and can affect my two pineapples I'm not

78
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,598
sure how but has me concerned with their

79
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,949
background I'm not sure how that would

80
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,798
make a difference since they are all

81
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:10,709
auto females but I've heard hemp plants

82
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,659
being an issue with pollinating non CBD

83
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,729
plants the plants just started veg

84
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,158
should I separate them then he says

85
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,738
thanks Russ to Jeff you are a beast take

86
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,408
a fat dab and hug your mom then they

87
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,849
sign their name from BAFTA shout out to

88
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:25,798
Bassett thanks for the great message

89
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:27,568
let's talk about this for a second

90
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,340
you've got a really great setup it

91
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:31,318
sounds like and you've got some quality

92
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,969
genetics you've got to pineapple Express

93
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,310
in there from fast buds those are

94
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,128
quality seeds you've got one pink cush

95
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,019
CBD from seeds man who is also another

96
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:42,060
reputable breeder those are all auto

97
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,489
flowers so far everything should work

98
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,939
well but you were told by people that is

99
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,639
not safe to have your CBD plants with

100
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,628
you're not CBD plants and then you said

101
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,979
you're not sure that it makes a

102
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:54,780
difference because they are all females

103
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,939
they are all females so you have no

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,459
chance of pollination you have heard

105
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:02,128
that hemp plants being an issue with

106
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,530
pollinating non CBD plants that would be

107
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:06,899
possible if you had a male but you don't

108
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,209
have any males you need a male to create

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,849
pollen or you need to do some reversing

110
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,739
or some stressing to cause a

111
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,628
hermaphrodite but you don't have a male

112
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,579
hopefully you've got three solid females

113
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:20,129
so there will be no problem there is no

114
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,710
way that your CBD plants are going to

115
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,718
affect your non CBD plants that is not a

116
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,908
thing that's nothing to worry about in

117
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:27,409
your indoor environment now if you were

118
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:29,959
in

119
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,510
outdoor environment those plants would

120
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,479
be able to receive pollen from cannabis

121
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,909
or hemp if there were a male hemp plant

122
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,980
or a male cannabis plant somewhere in

123
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,110
the vicinity and some wind picked up

124
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,790
some pollen or a bird picked up some

125
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,740
pollen or an insect one of our

126
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,170
pollinator friends grab some pollen

127
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,600
traveled from that male plant over to

128
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,939
your female Auto flower plants yes they

129
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,460
could be pollinated that way but again

130
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:58,310
we need a male we need a pollinator

131
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,409
plant to add pollen to your females you

132
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,120
said you've got three females unless you

133
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,090
introduce some pollen you will be just

134
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,680
fine there should be no issues so I

135
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,509
completely understand what you're asking

136
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,639
and I hope I have answered your question

137
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,469
thoroughly in short you've got three

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,819
girls where's the pollen going to come

139
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,070
from that is going to pollinate these

140
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,750
plants you either need a male you need

141
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,550
to reverse a female or you need one of

142
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,500
those females to hermaphrodite due to

143
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,180
stress or poor breeding which is always

144
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,779
an option but that's not we're talking

145
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,310
about now

146
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,199
now we're talking about you've got three

147
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,780
females so you are not going to have any

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
pollen now let me elaborate a little on

149
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,889
this subject because something that I

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,849
see happening in the near future is a

151
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:40,669
very realistic concern many people in

152
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,150
many places are growing large-scale

153
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,819
outdoor hemp projects in those same

154
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:50,509
areas people are growing large-scale

155
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:52,310
outdoor cannabis projects now the

156
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,110
Department of Ag and horticultural

157
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,209
experts and other people will argue this

158
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,759
statement but currently what we are

159
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:01,009
deciding what differentiates your

160
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,199
cannabis from your hemp is basically a

161
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,060
lab test at this point if you are

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,009
finished dried and cured product the

163
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,680
product that is tested by the lab if

164
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,379
that product contains 0.3 percent THC

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,590
you have got a cannabis plant if that

166
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:19,339
product contains less than 0.3 percent

167
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:21,469
THC you have got a hemp plant but in all

168
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,659
reality there is nothing stopping a

169
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,060
cannabis plant from receiving hemp

170
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,610
pollen there is nothing stopping a hemp

171
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,189
plant from receiving cannabis pollen we

172
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,189
have got a lot of new farmers that are

173
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:36,199
jumping on the hemp and CBD bandwagon

174
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,660
they're buying big chunks of land which

175
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,149
may be right next to our medical and

176
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,680
recreational cannabis farms and there's

177
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,259
setting up their hemp farm in that same

178
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,980
area many of these people are growing

179
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,469
from seed there are a lot of new seed

180
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,660
breeders and vendors in the hemp game

181
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,790
I'm sure many of those seeds are

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,860
problematic I'm sure that a lot of

183
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,470
people are selling feminized seeds that

184
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,379
are not done properly I think it is a

185
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,630
safe guess to predict that in the very

186
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,339
near future some of these outdoor hemp

187
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,889
fields are going to get out of control

188
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:11,560
they're going to miss a mail and we are

189
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,389
going to pollinate some of our outdoor

190
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,480
medical and recreational cannabis crops

191
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,399
with rogue pollen from hemp that came

192
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,100
from another farm from an irresponsible

193
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,959
farmer I see it happening I know it will

194
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,640
happen in the future I can see it

195
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,979
there's nothing stopping it there are

196
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,050
things that we can do agriculturally we

197
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,420
can set up barriers kind of nature wise

198
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,009
but it's not going to stop every piece

199
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,140
of pollen we can't stop a pollinator

200
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,789
insect or a pollinator bird we can't

201
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,009
stop all of the wind it is going to

202
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,689
happen so I bet that in the very near

203
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,689
future we are going to see outdoor

204
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,819
cannabis and hemp crops that are kind of

205
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:48,620
not destroyed but partially ruined

206
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,509
because they were pollinated by

207
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,399
irresponsible farmers that did not

208
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,529
identify and cull the males in their

209
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,060
outdoor hemp or a cannabis garden this

210
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:57,829
could happen in a hemp or a cannabis

211
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,240
garden I'm kind of assuming it's going

212
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,529
to be more common in a hemp field

213
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,910
because those are that's a little bit

214
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,039
more new of an industry to a lot of

215
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,410
people but this is going to be a thing

216
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,260
in the very near future however let's

217
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,910
get back on track mr. basta I do not

218
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,620
believe that this is an issue you need

219
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,210
to worry about in your indoor grill you

220
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,730
don't have a male plant so nothing is

221
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:18,469
going to get pollinated Bastyr wraps up

222
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,509
this message by saying thanks Rasta Jeff

223
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,250
you are a beast hey I appreciate that

224
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,289
I like supporting the community I'm glad

225
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,329
that you find me to be a beast and then

226
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,939
he says take a phat dab and hug your mom

227
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:31,370
I just took a gigantic dab and I promise

228
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,080
you I'll give mama a hug the next time I

229
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,730
see her hey pastor thank you for the

230
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,470
great message I look forward to hearing

231
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,149
from you in the future

232
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,889
all right I've got another email in

233
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,319
front of me this one is good it goes

234
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:44,210
like this first and foremost thank you

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,530
for doing the podcast it is excellent

236
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,480
hey you're very welcome thank you for

237
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,250
the great compliment they said you make

238
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,899
the world a little better man much

239
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,000
appreciate it hey I appreciate those

240
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,019
kind of compliments that means a lot to

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,879
me the email goes on it says

242
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,799
my question is about how to rejuvenate a

243
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,320
flowered plant I have an amazing

244
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,559
Jamaican blueberry that I do not have

245
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,210
clones of and I would love to save

246
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,979
Jamaican blueberry that sounds delicious

247
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,259
I would have definitely taken a clone of

248
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,970
that one the message goes on it says I

249
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,500
always take clones off of my cultivars

250
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,480
before they flower but something weird

251
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,370
happened with this one it all of a

252
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,320
sudden started flowering in the veg room

253
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,899
at first I thought I had received some

254
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,460
Otto flower seeds by mistake seeing that

255
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,870
other plants from the same seeds in

256
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,670
different parts of the bedroom were not

257
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,950
flowering I investigated further

258
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:31,019
I found a nearby plant of a different

259
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,120
cultivar supposedly feminized and

260
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,939
hermaphrodite it and developed just one

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,070
small set of pollen sacks it is my

262
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,150
understanding that if pollen sacks show

263
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,160
up in a veg room

264
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,319
they can cause female plants in the

265
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,589
bedroom to start to flower I believe

266
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,930
that is what happened to me I would

267
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,450
strongly disagree I do not think I do

268
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:53,519
not believe I do not understand why I do

269
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,650
not think that a hermaphrodite in plant

270
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,019
in that room would encourage the other

271
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,809
plants to flower that is not a thing I

272
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,840
do not believe that pollen sacks from

273
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:06,449
your hermaphroditic feminized plant are

274
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,220
what caused your other female plants in

275
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,200
that bedroom to begin to flower I would

276
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,210
strongly disagree with that from your

277
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,370
message what I strongly believe has

278
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,800
happened is you do not have enough light

279
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,019
in your bedroom you've either got too

280
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,120
little light not enough intensity or

281
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,889
you've got the wrong spectrum or perhaps

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,350
it the light is too far from the canopy

283
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,539
or even you've got the plants to squish

284
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,000
together and they are just frustrated I

285
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,469
would guess that that one feminized

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,539
cultivar that you found be

287
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,430
hermaphroditic flowers on I'm going to

288
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,990
guess it is in the corner it is farthest

289
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,299
from the light and that hermaphrodite

290
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,490
flower is somewhere near the bottom or

291
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,199
it is not getting enough light the main

292
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,509
thing that decides when a plant flowers

293
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,460
is genetics you said you believe you do

294
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,750
not have OTO flowers and we are seeing

295
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,790
that some plants in your room are

296
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,590
flowering and some are not so that leads

297
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,959
me to believe you don't have OTO flowers

298
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,210
the next contributing factor that

299
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,850
decides when your plants flower is light

300
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,400
light interval light intensity light

301
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,690
duration is it all dialed in you're

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,579
telling me that these plants are

303
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,740
starting to flower while they are in veg

304
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,690
it leads me to believe that you don't

305
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,879
have enough light

306
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,800
in there and those select phenotypes

307
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,659
that are flowering just having a little

308
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,159
bit different light sensitivity than the

309
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:18,079
phenotypes which have not chosen to

310
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,850
flower on you so my first question is

311
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,860
going to be what kind of light are you

312
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,480
using how intense is that light how

313
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,639
close to the canopy is that light

314
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,620
fixture then I want to know what is your

315
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,019
light schedule how many hours per day

316
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,090
are you running that light how are the

317
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,949
plants reacting to it they're obviously

318
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,110
trying to flower so I don't think

319
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,670
they're getting enough light also you

320
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,039
have got two Jamaican

321
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,689
blueberry plants in here think about

322
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:44,059
where those plants came from they came

323
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,250
from Jamaica think about the environment

324
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,689
in Jamaica think about the photo period

325
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,750
in Jamaica

326
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,570
these plants want bright intense long

327
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,639
daylight so these plants probably expect

328
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,410
really bright long hot days and they're

329
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,659
probably not getting that in your grow

330
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,639
environment the message goes on it says

331
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,980
to Jamaican blueberry plants have

332
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,319
started to flower I immediately took

333
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,960
clones off of both I was able to get

334
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,150
clones to root no problem on one of them

335
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,400
but none of the clones of the other have

336
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,649
survived now as they are nearing

337
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,799
completion as fate would have it the one

338
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,179
I could not get clones to root looks

339
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,189
unbelievable which leads me back to my

340
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:24,739
original question can you help me

341
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,570
rejuvenate this plant after flower is

342
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,120
there a podcast number that discusses

343
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,150
this topic or is there any other advice

344
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,299
that you can give thank you in advance

345
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,549
signed TJ hey TJ I don't remember if I

346
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:39,169
have done a rejuvenation episode so I'm

347
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,729
going to press pause I'm going to search

348
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:42,229
for that right quick and then when I get

349
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,060
back I'll let you know what number it

350
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,980
was if I've done it and if not we're

351
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,829
going to talk about rejuvenating and

352
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,490
Reve edging your Jamaican blueberry

353
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:55,430
plants alright I gave it a quick check

354
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,289
and I have done a region or an entire

355
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,019
episode on rivetting or cannabis plants

356
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:02,240
it is episode number 152 I'm sure I go

357
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,769
into great detail in that episode so if

358
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,539
you want to learn more about reef edging

359
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:09,139
your flowered cannabis plants I highly

360
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:10,730
recommend revisiting episode 152 but we

361
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,649
are here now and you were asking the

362
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,320
question today so let's talk really

363
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:18,319
briefly a quick lesson on Reve edging

364
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,260
flowered cannabis plants this may sound

365
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,379
crazy but successful reef edging simple

366
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,960
successful revenge

367
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,789
starts late in Flour when you start

368
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,980
flushing approximately two weeks before

369
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:32,399
harvest I suggest you turn the lights

370
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,950
back to 24 hours on and zero hours off

371
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,779
what everyone's head just blew up we're

372
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,040
in the end of flour we were trying to

373
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,019
flush our plants and you're telling this

374
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,110
person to put his lights on 24 hours on

375
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,909
at zero hours off yes we are so late in

376
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,769
the flowering cycle that we are not

377
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,480
going to disrupt the flowering we're

378
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:50,129
about to cut them down so as soon as we

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,409
see any problems we're gonna chop the

380
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,179
plants don't even worry about it we want

381
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:56,579
to reverse the hormones in this plant

382
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,559
this plant is full on an old-lady mode

383
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,970
it is at the end of its life cycle we

384
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,439
need to convince this plant that it

385
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,090
wants to go from old lady

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,130
back to a young girl so that we can

387
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,840
start fresh with her the only way we can

388
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,879
do that is to make this plant think it

389
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,769
is a different season we need to make

390
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,960
this plant think that it is spring and

391
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:14,850
it is time to start over so we want to

392
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,710
put the light cycle in a spring type

393
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,659
condition we don't want this plant to

394
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,460
sleep at all that is when the flowering

395
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,949
is induced is during those dark cycles

396
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,259
so we want to leave it on as much as

397
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,670
possible 24 hours of the most intense

398
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,110
light you can give it you can put it

399
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:30,509
under a thousand watt light that is

400
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,340
where you want it 24 hours a day of a

401
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,090
thousand watt light for our revenge

402
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,639
process so start that 14 days before you

403
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,960
intend to harvest your plant you can

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,549
flush this plant just like you're

405
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,200
flushing the rest of the plants continue

406
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,750
to flush do everything just like you

407
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,050
would except we want the lights on for

408
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,750
24 hours on and zero hours off now in

409
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:54,389
harvest comes harvest almost like you

410
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,809
would any other harvest except we want

411
00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:00,179
to leave the bottom two or four or maybe

412
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,829
six little tiny popcorn buds on this

413
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,379
plant just some bottoms we don't need

414
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,180
much here to revenge the less is better

415
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,789
when it comes to trying to revenge a

416
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,679
plant so you've got it on 24 hours for

417
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,419
two weeks before harvest harvest time

418
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,699
comes we chop down the majority of the

419
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,349
plant we leave for little tiny buds on

420
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,730
the bottom maybe six maybe eight just

421
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,170
just a bunch of little buds on the

422
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,090
bottom we don't need a lot to work with

423
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,729
so you've got these little buds on the

424
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:27,330
bottom just leave those on that 24 hour

425
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,700
light cycle feed them a heavy veg mix we

426
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,889
need a lot of nitrogen we need minimal

427
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,320
amounts of phosphorus and potassium I

428
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,169
would recommend high doses of kelp and

429
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,750
of course a lot of micro

430
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:40,939
the soil that root ball has been around

431
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,769
for quite some time it's probably root

432
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,690
bound if you can put it into a larger

433
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,659
pot without causing damage that may be

434
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,579
advantageous also so get it in a bigger

435
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:51,500
pot if you can feed it some strong

436
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:53,539
VegNews with a lot of nitrogen again I

437
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,278
recommend a kelp product something like

438
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:57,289
liquid karma or something in that vein

439
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,679
would work wonderfully for you keep it

440
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:03,199
on a 24 hour light cycle until you see

441
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:05,719
those buds start producing normal

442
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,200
looking leaves for several weeks that

443
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,850
plant is going to kick out weird weird

444
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,170
looking leaves they're going to be

445
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,700
twisted they're gonna be spun around

446
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:15,439
they're gonna look like a cloth they're

447
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,899
not going to be the right shape that is

448
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,570
to be expected for several several weeks

449
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,399
depending on your cultivar depending on

450
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,350
the plant you're working with reeve

451
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,690
edging this plant could take you six

452
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,550
maybe eight weeks from the time you cut

453
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,250
the rest of it off so keep watching

454
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,599
those leaves eventually it will grow out

455
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,039
of that little bud you've got a little

456
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,659
bud right now that bud is going to

457
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,069
develop new leaves it'll start stacking

458
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:39,259
up and getting taller new growth will

459
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,510
come out of it eventually that new

460
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,250
growth will start to look like a normal

461
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:44,600
plant it will look like what we expect

462
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,149
and what we're hoping for and what were

463
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,940
what we are familiar with so once you've

464
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,250
got that nice healthy familiar growth

465
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,560
happening then I suggest you take a

466
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,389
clone from that if you've got several

467
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,909
healthy tops on that plant and you are

468
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,620
not a really good cloner maybe only take

469
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:03,049
one or two clones and leave one or two

470
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,720
behind in case you don't have good luck

471
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:07,338
with your clones so once you've got that

472
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,798
good growth coming out of the plant it

473
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:12,740
is time to clone it take one or two

474
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:14,869
clones those become the mother plant you

475
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,578
don't want to run those in my opinion I

476
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,769
would grow that out and I would take

477
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,959
five or six clones off of that and that

478
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,000
would be the next crop that I run so

479
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,068
let's recap real quickly my Reeve edging

480
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,289
process it starts approximately two

481
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:30,230
weeks before harvest put your lights on

482
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:32,960
a 24 hour on and zero hours off light

483
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,690
cycle then at harvest time chop it down

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,279
but leave a few bottom buds somewhere

485
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,690
between two and eight bottom buds I

486
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,950
don't know how big of a plant you've got

487
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,779
I don't know what you're working with

488
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,740
leave some stuff on the bottom that's

489
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,799
the important part

490
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,569
leave that part in veg leave it on a 24

491
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,269
hour light cycle with as much light as

492
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:52,579
you can give it continue to feed it

493
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:55,400
heavy veg feed you want a lot of

494
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:57,230
nitrogen and again a kelp product leave

495
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,000
it on that veg cycle until you see it

496
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,759
starting to produce normal-looking

497
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,259
leaves let it grow a little longer once

498
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,680
it's got those normal leaves the longer

499
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,410
the better

500
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,500
but then clone that good-looking growth

501
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,930
and that clone becomes your new mother

502
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,970
plant use that to take clones from and

503
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,490
grow those clones and you should not see

504
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,230
any loss in quality or vigor

505
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,089
there will be no what is known as

506
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,860
genetic drift which we have disproven on

507
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:25,069
this podcast that is not a term that

508
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:27,740
applies in this situation in any way so

509
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:30,439
that is my quick review on how to Reve

510
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,480
edge our cannabis plants now don't

511
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,660
forget that you had problems cloning

512
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,700
this specific cultivar in the past so be

513
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,769
sure to be extra careful when you were

514
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,900
cloning at this time what did you do

515
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,720
wrong why would it not clone last time

516
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,370
do you remember what the issue was this

517
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,200
is your last chance if you can't get

518
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:50,089
clones off of it this time it is time to

519
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,490
let it go you're going to be wasting too

520
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:54,439
much time space and energy in this plant

521
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,900
if it doesn't work this time so make

522
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,150
this one count I have done entire

523
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,950
episodes on producing clones I've done

524
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,600
an episode on cutting clothes into rapid

525
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,730
rooters I've done an episode on cutting

526
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,619
clones and an easy clone machine if you

527
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,079
need help cutting clones I recommend

528
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:11,259
checking out those episodes my most

529
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,639
recent cutting clone episode is number

530
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:15,710
364 so I highly recommend that one

531
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,390
before you try cutting clones again I'm

532
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,799
not disrespecting your clone tech I'm

533
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,720
just saying maybe a little bit of advice

534
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,940
will help you out since you had troubles

535
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,549
with this specific cultivar in the past

536
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,410
I'd really hate to see you revenge and

537
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:29,029
take all of that time and then not even

538
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,980
be able to get a living clone off of it

539
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,730
so maybe check out that cutting clones

540
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,319
episode again that is number 364 all

541
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,940

573
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,818
that I receive from patreon I do things

574
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:36,128
like I pay for my website I hosted this

575
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:38,918
podcast on my website I read genetics

576
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:40,598
Colorado comm I use those funds from

577
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,209
patreon to pay for the website to keep

578
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:45,009
the podcast free for everybody I also

579
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:47,109
use those funds to pay for my internet

580
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,868
connection which also helps us get the

581
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:51,428
podcast out to everybody for free I also

582
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,808
use the funding for things like these

583
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,339
little microphone covers so that I don't

584
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:55,719
have to keep smelling my own breath and

585
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:57,759
spitting into the same microphone cover

586
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:59,709
forever also when Mike comes over he

587
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,940
gets a freshie cover when Davin Granny's

588
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,318
on the show she gets a freshie

589
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,969
whenever I have somebody on the show a

590
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:05,678
new person comes we get a new microphone

591
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:07,599
cover so you guys are covering things

592
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,399
like that also when equipment breaks a

593
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:11,259
while back we had a headphone amplifier

594
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:13,388
take a [ __ ] on us things like that are

595
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,429
replaced with the generosity of our

596
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:16,689
friends from patreon so that is why I'm

597
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,819
doing with the funding and I do

598
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,798
