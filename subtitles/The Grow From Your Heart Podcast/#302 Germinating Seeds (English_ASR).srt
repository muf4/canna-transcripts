for episode 302 of the girl from your

27
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:01,759
heart podcast I'm sure you noticed a

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,320
difference in the intro music I do have

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,640
permission from my friends in the mystic

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,579
roots man to use their track however

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,890
when I put these videos up on YouTube

32
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,560
YouTube Flags every video that has got a

33
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,939
mystic roots track in it so in an effort

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
to prevent myself from pissing off

35
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,469
YouTube I am using my own original music

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,300
I will get permission from mystic roots

37
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,310
they've given me permission we've got

38
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,739
emails about it coots my friend we talk

39
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,019
regularly however YouTube doesn't know

40
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:28,309
that and YouTube doesn't know that we've

41
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,629
had a conversation so until we can

42
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,640
figure out how to get management to

43
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:33,859
clear that with YouTube I will simply be

44
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,049
using my own music the track you just

45
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,790
heard was my own Rasta Jeff reggae

46
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,500
creation using GarageBand nice and easy

47
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,820
I hope you enjoyed that if you've got

48
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,228
some music that you can give me

49
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,659
permission to use on the show I would

50
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,618

53
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:54,140
tracks welcome to episode 302 you guys

54
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:57,620
today I am smoking on some Tahoe og and

55
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,019
it is tremendous track and open the jar

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,600
to give it a little smell it smells

57
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,219
exactly like what Tahoe og is supposed

58
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:08,359
to smell like you guys it's got some og

59
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:10,069
cush to it it's got a little funky fuel

60
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,320
to it it's got a hint of gasoline in

61
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,060
there just a hint of gasoline not it

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,289
doesn't overpower you with gas it's got

63
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,269
more of that oh gee Kush lower earthy

64
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:22,370
coffee sort of a thing do you know how

65
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,530
ice cream coffee ice cream smells like

66
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,640
coffee but not extremely strong but when

67
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,590
you get close to it you can smell that

68
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,449
coffee aroma that's kind of the coffee

69
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,509
the soft coffee aroma that comes with

70
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,679
this Tahoe og batter I just smelled the

71
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:35,659
microphone thinking that that would help

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,750
me smell the batter a little louder it

73
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,629
didn't work uh and it's got a nice

74
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,120
golden buttery texture to it it has got

75
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,280
a very nice indica dominant high to it

76
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,750
when I smoke this my life slows down a

77
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,400
little bit my head gets a little heavy

78
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,360
my eyes get droopy my arms feel like

79
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,819
they weigh a little more than they

80
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,320
should I really like it shout out to our

81

99
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,579
caught up here's my intention my idea

100
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:38,500
what I'm trying to do iTunes and

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,530
stitcher will hold 100 episodes of my

102
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,580
podcast I am at episode 302 as long as

103
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,500
I've got the lat the 100 most recent and

104
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,390
iTunes and then I get everything else up

105
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,889
into YouTube and stay caught up right

106
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,199
there I feel like I'm mostly caught up

107
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:56,319
one day I will have every single episode

108
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,849
up on YouTube all 302 will be there when

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,979
I'm at 302 it's probably it takes about

110
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,919
350 or 400 honestly to catch up with

111
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:05,319
myself but I'm getting there I am making

112
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,000
equipment upgrades I'm doing things that

113
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,530
will speed up my productivity it just

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,939
takes time to be productive you guys

115
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,860
making YouTube videos is very time

116
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,539
consuming making the video doesn't take

117
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,890
that long honestly it's getting the

118
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,089
video to post to youtube that takes

119
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,339
forever I complain about it constantly

120
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,929
I'm sure you guys know a 1-hour YouTube

121
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,939
video will take three to four hours to

122
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,590
post a YouTube while it's happening I

123
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,480
cannot use my computer my computer is

124
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:27,759
basically stuck it is a slave to YouTube

125
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
at that time can't do anything but we'll

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,129
get caught up

127
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,810

192
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,929
first email does this guy see if I can

193
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,189
use his name or not oh you could

194
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:42,288
probably see right through the paper if

195
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,968
you watch the video let's see this one

196
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:47,209
says hey Rasta Jeff I have a terrible

197
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:48,829
dilemma I'm a fairly new grower only

198
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,809
with two grows officially under my belt

199
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,879
I have a friend who uses sativa dominant

200
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:56,209
strains to medicate they're my favorite

201
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,099
to enjoy also and after helping him in a

202
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,379
pinch after my last harvest he asked if

203
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,579
I could grow for his medicinal needs so

204
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,019
it sounds like this dude ran out of some

205
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,158
herb and you gave him some of your

206
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,360
product that you grew and he was

207
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,459
impressed and now he's asking you to

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,629
grow for him that is a great way to get

209
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,488
your foot in the door that's a great way

210
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,468
to become a caregiver that's also a

211
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:13,818
great way to feel some pride knowing

212
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:15,618
that you're doing things right so I'm

213
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,449
gonna keep going he says I agreed of

214
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:19,159
course but now I am having a problem

215
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,348
with getting my seedlings going I've

216
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:23,509
burned through 10 seedlings of IRA

217
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:25,519
genetics seeds and three Doc Johnson's

218
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,259
this cycle I've started from seed before

219
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,699
and I've never had this problem

220
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,939
I built an enclosed 3 by 2 by 1 by half

221
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,860
of

222
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,350
foot enclosure to start my seeds before

223
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,830
moving them into a 4x4 tent with LED

224
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,540
lighting I'm running an LED Gro LED grow

225
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:44,240
light from a big box store paired with

226
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,830
some CFLs to get the party started the

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,829
enclosure is lined with reflective

228
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:52,039
material humidity around 40% and temp

229
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:54,259
from 65 to 70% small computer fans for

230
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,760
fresh air and exhaust I can't figure out

231
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,740
why they are damping off

232
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,079
I even had tomatoes and peppers in there

233
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,210
and they all did the same any advice is

234
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,339
greatly appreciated thanks again and

235
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,629
stay Irie then he signed it with his

236
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,119
name which I'm not sure if he wants read

237
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:11,149
on the air then he says PS I hit up your

238
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,030
patreon thank you so much for all that

239
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,159
you do so there are a lot of things that

240
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:17,989
got my attention here thanks for the

241
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,090
great email by the way this is good

242
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,569
content this gives me a great platform

243
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,729
to get on a rant you've built a 3 by 2

244
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,670
by 1 by half foot enclosure I'm trying

245
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,759
to envision envision that 3 foot tall 2

246
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,930
foot by 1 foot by 1/2 ok I get it now to

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,059
start your seeds I'm guessing I think I

248
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,668
have an idea before moving them into the

249
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:41,269
4x4 so there are a couple of details

250
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:43,129
that you left out um are they dying

251
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,309
before they make it to the 4x4 or are

252
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,570
they at least getting that far I'm not

253
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:49,429
sure if they're even making it out of

254
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,450
your enclosure so you're saying that

255
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,259
you're burning off the seeds you're

256
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,610
killing the seeds they're drying up I

257
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:58,159
would recommend more humidity in that

258
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,669
small space I would get that humidity at

259
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,409
least up around 50% maybe 60 or 75% if

260
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,449
you're starting seeds those little seeds

261
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,679
want some moisture it's getting too dry

262
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,990
in there that's why they're drying out

263
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,319
it's simply too dry and I would get it a

264
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,029
little warmer you've got it 65 to 70

265
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,070
cold and dry come together when it gets

266
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,870
cold your skin gets dry [ __ ] gets dry so

267
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,190
you're getting it too cold and they're

268
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,389
drying out that's simply what's

269
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,540
happening you need more heat and more

270
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:25,549
water and that will create humidity and

271
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,139
that's gonna help you out overall maybe

272
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:29,449
just turn off those small computer fans

273
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,949
for a fresh air and exhaust it sounds

274
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,629
like you're just you've created a wind

275
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,860
tunnel and so you've got a seedling

276
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:35,210
sitting right here and say the

277
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,500
microphone is the seedling and this is

278
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,150
your fan

279
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,980
just blowing on him all day bro just

280
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,209
drying him out your dirts getting dry it

281
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,700
out your seedlings are getting dried out

282
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,650
you just got too much airflow probably

283
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,509
in that little tiny space and not enough

284
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,610
moisture I would add some humidity I

285
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,100
would increase the temperature that

286
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,840
would help him out no um there are a

287
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,090
couple things that you left out that I'm

288
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,560
not sure how to help you because I don't

289
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,440
know what medium you're using are using

290
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,029
cocoa or using soil are you using peat

291
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,920
are using a soilless mix are you in

292
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,509
hydro I don't know what kind of medium

293
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,799
they're getting into I don't know how

294
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,960
far you've gotten them I don't know how

295
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,689
you're sprouting them I don't know so I

296
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,550
can only help you so much also

297
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,190
how often and how much are you watering

298
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,599
these plants are you soaking the [ __ ]

299
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,160
out of them and letting them go from

300
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,870
really wet to kind of dry or you just

301
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,539
barely keeping them wet by watering them

302
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,190
really frequently I'm not sure what

303
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:29,750
you're doing so I'm not sure what your

304
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,610
method is so I'm not sure how to tell

305
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,440
you to adjust other than they need more

306
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,000
water they need more moisture they need

307
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,060
more humidity and they need more heat

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,159
and it would probably help so let me

309
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,169
know what you're doing and I will follow

310
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,179
up with you when I get your follow-up

311
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:47,750
email but so far it just sounds like

312
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:49,849
that small space is getting it's too

313
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,110
cold which sounds like it would keep the

314
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,600
moisture in there but think about when

315
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,070
it's cold your lips get chapped

316
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,080
refrigeration creates dryness so you're

317
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,550
kind of making it too cold in there to

318
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,350
keep your moisture in there all right

319
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:02,719
now I'm gonna read this next email and

320
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,700
it kind of coincides with this one it

321
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,259
says hey Ross - Jeff thanks for the show

322
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,210
and all the calleb cannabis knowledge

323
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:09,740
you throw out I joined in on one of your

324
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,629
Instagram live feeds tonight and I

325
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,980
really enjoyed it I really liked the

326
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,929
story about the guy you met at a show

327
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,340
and traded the Grateful dog with you

328
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,109
guys that story will come up on a future

329
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,720
episode also by the way that is a great

330
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,340
story um then it goes on he says but I

331
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,870
digress I digress how do you go about

332
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,940
popping seeds I've heard many different

333
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,679
techniques that just get more and more

334
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,140
complicated like soaking the seeds in

335
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,000
water then dipping them in mykos once

336
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,769
they crack then putting them in a damp

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,269
paper towel till the tap roots pop out

338
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,240
and then finally planting the seeds in

339
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,129
soil what's wrong with the good ol

340
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,710
finger in the soil and drop the seed in

341
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:45,439
what's the benefits from soaking a seed

342
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,629
or doing the paper towel technique and

343
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,270
he says thanks again you can use my real

344
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:51,830
name from Aaron hey Aaron thanks for the

345
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,120
great email dude and also thanks for

346
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,980
giving me permission to use your name

347
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,090
because it cuts out a lot of uh do I do

348
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,500
this or not and I like to give people

349
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,360

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,620
names if they want it on the show uh I

351
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,509
don't know if you listen but Joey Diaz

352
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,279
said my name on the podcast a few weeks

353
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,389
ago and it made me [ __ ] giddy so I'm

354
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,919
sure that I make people a little bit

355
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:08,240
giddy inside when I say their names so

356
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,250
if you want your name said let me know I

357
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,769
will give you a shout-out now let's get

358
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,049
into these questions here lots of great

359
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,039
questions on this email lots of good

360
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:20,029
stuff to go over

361
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,889
ah the one he says what's wrong with the

362
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,110
good ol finger and the soil and dropped

363
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,669
the seed and uh nothing is wrong with

364
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,050
that technique

365
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:29,959
that's the technique that I used to use

366
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,449
until I became impatient and employed my

367
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,920
new technique just for to be a little

368
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,940
more careful to be a little more to pay

369
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,149
a little more attention to have a little

370
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,300
more control so this is how most people

371
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,409
used to do seeds and also what's wrong

372
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,000
with that technique as seeds are

373
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:45,529
expensive cannabis seeds have become

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,529
ridiculously expensive so when you're

375
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,419
paying more than $10 per seed you want

376
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,039
to do everything you can to get every

377
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,120
seed to count and when you're just

378
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,250
putting them straight into the dirt

379
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,720
there's a lot of chaos that can go on

380
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,549
there there are a lot of variables if

381
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,220
you're not on top of things you can kill

382
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:03,979
those seeds if you're just sprouting any

383
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,410
other seed they're cheap they're less

384
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,690
than $1 per seed most vegetables but

385
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,789
cannabis has gotten ridiculous they're 5

386
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,580
to 15 I've seen $20 seeds out there

387
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,620
there's 10 packs of seeds going for 250

388
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,600
bucks of certain strains right now it's

389
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,060
not uncommon so seeds cannabis seeds are

390
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,620
ridiculously expensive what's wrong with

391
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,329
the old finger and the soil and drop the

392
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,990
seed in technique nothing if you know

393
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,270
what you're doing

394
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,639
what this guy is talking about I would

395
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:31,639
get a solo cup with decent soil

396
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,399
something like I hate saying brands but

397
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,960
something like Fox farms ah the light

398
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,459
warrior or the ocean forest would work

399
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,340
for you something fluffy like that with

400
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,540
perlite a decent starting soil fill your

401
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,100
beer cup up if you're gonna use like a

402
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,569
solo cup or a beer cup fill your beer

403
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,620
cup up most of the way with dirt poke

404
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,290
some holes in it in the bottom so you

405
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,720
have drainage then before you put the

406
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,549
ceiling in there water that pot why do

407
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,550
that cup water that dirt saturate it

408
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:57,799
then take your fingertip and I've got

409
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,779
big fingers so I would go about half way

410
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,069
to my first knuckle I'd say for most

411
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,449
people if you're normal sized person go

412
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,220
almost to the first knuckle deep in that

413
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,060
soil just poke a little hole boink just

414
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,759
put your finger in there

415
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,199
you only need to go I'm trying to find

416
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,289
it something to measure the depth of

417
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,960
that it's if you're using lined paper

418
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:17,149
the length between the lines that's all

419
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,240
you need to go the depth of the width of

420
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,220
a pen so however your finger your finger

421
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,450
the the width of it go that deep I know

422
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,950
that's too many [ __ ] words to

423
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,270
describe what I'm trying to say just

424
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,129
just barely poke it in you just need

425
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,929
that that seed to go under the dirt so

426
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:31,279
poke it and then set the seed there and

427
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,899
then just push a little dirt right over

428
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,490
it and just kind of tap it so that it's

429
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,350
secure and then just leave it alone put

430
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,060
it under a light and that seedling will

431
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,930
grow up toward the light and the taproot

432
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,250
will grow down

433
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,299
that's what seeds want to do they want

434
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,009
to grow up toward the light the taproot

435
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,449
wants to go down that's what it wants to

436
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:46,370
do so if you put it in there you take

437
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,480
good care of it that will work but you

438
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,700
have to keep it at the proper moisture

439
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,710
level you have to keep the room not too

440
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,509
windy you have to keep the lights on you

441
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,589
have to keep things right and like I

442
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,679
said earlier with the price of these

443
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,330
seeds that's kind of risky people don't

444
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,429
have all day to babysit them people

445
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,470
can't risk them so that's when we start

446
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:05,958
employing these other techniques they

447
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,990
get more and more complicated you said

448
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,149
like soaking the seed in water I only do

449
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,759
that with old seeds if my seeds are

450
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,409
fresh and fairly new and from a reliable

451
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,659
breeder and I've gotten them recently I

452
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:19,969
do not do the soak if the seeds are kind

453
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,259
of old I will give them a soak so you've

454
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,720
got some old seeds and you want to

455
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:27,830
germinate them I would start by soaking

456
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,810
them in water for 12 to 18 maybe 24

457
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,040
hours at the most don't go more than 24

458
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,649
hours they'll start getting gooey and

459
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,679
you'll drown them so only with old seeds

460
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,778
so those then if you've got seeds that

461
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,219
are not old there if you just got some

462
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,240
hydrogen etic seeds from the holiday

463
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,860
exceed bank and you're trying to get

464
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,600
those started here's what I would do I

465
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,070
would get a plate and I'd get a paper

466
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,649
towel and I'd pour water all over the

467
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,330
paper towel and fold that into quarters

468
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,100
then I would tip the plate and let all

469
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,389
the excess water run off just let that

470
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,120
water run off you want the paper towel

471
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:57,740
saturated towards filled with water then

472
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,149
just put your seeds right inside and see

473
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,580
you got it fold it into fours already

474
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,659
it's about the size of your iPhone put

475
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,339
the seeds right in the middle and fold

476
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,559
it one more time and then put that

477
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,570
inside of a ziplock baggie and set it on

478
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,458
top of the refrigerator on the plate

479
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,260
leave the plate set the baggie on the

480
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,609
plate on top of the refrigerator now the

481
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,230
refrigerator is gonna get a little bit

482
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,480
warm up top but the plate is gonna give

483
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,459
you a little bit of a buffer zone that

484
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,470
water inside the baggie is going to be

485
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,399
trapped you're going to create humidity

486
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,570
inside of that baggie

487
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,549
you've got enough water in there to

488
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,110
activate those seeds they're gonna crack

489
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,639
they're gonna start growing they're

490
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,079
gonna stay alive in there because you've

491
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
got all the air trapped in there and

492
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,599
they're not gonna dry out it shouldn't

493
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,149
take too long 12 24 36 maybe 48 hours in

494
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,009
that baggie now you've got germinated

495
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,259
crack seeds you can see what's alive you

496
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,328
can see how long your tap root is don't

497
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,740
let that root get too long an inch or so

498
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,389
is long enough that's getting

499
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,649
dangerously long once it starts getting

500
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,088
that long it's gonna start getting real

501
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,730
leggy and it's gonna start growing funky

502
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,019
so you get that sprouted tap root

503
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,370
and this is where you get the beer cup

504
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,810
that we talked about earlier the beer

505
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,730
cup with holes in the bottom that's

506
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:00,439
filled with soil that is already

507
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,329
saturated you guys you want the soil

508
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,649
already wet before you put the seed in

509
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,418
there so that when you put the seed in

510
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,400
there any backfill it you don't disturb

511
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,459
it by watering it so have it wet first

512
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,199
wet the medium first poke your finger in

513
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,818
there you want to go just a little bit

514
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,110
deeper than you would have with a fresh

515
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:17,720
seedling if you've got your sprouted

516
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,369
ceiling just go a little bit just just

517
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,048
maybe your first knuckle then set that

518
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,000
seedling in there real carefully don't

519
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:24,588
disrupt that tap root you want the tap

520
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,750
root pointing down and the seed pointing

521
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:29,240
up set it in there brush a little dirt

522
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,069
over it and let it chill now you've

523
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,990
either soaked them and got them started

524
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:34,519
for 24 hours to soften them up then you

525
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,558
put them in the paper towel and you're

526
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,410
checking them every six hours ish you

527
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,609
want to check them at 12 18 24 hours and

528
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,380
get them in a dirt as soon as they're

529
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,659
starting to sprout now your seeds have

530
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,070
successfully made it to the dirt there's

531
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,840
less risk when you've got them in that

532
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:50,058
paper towel in the baggie because they

533
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,699
can't dry out and drying out seems to be

534
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:54,918
what's killing everybody's seeds also I

535
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,058
do not like a heat mat for the seeds I

536
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,980
said put them on top of the fridge

537
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,389
that's not much heat it's a very little

538
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,980
heat you've got them up on top of the

539
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,929
refrigerator there's a plate and then

540
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,640
they're in the baggie that's very little

541
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,350
heat those heat mats you guys get out of

542
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,000
control they're hard to regulate you

543
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:10,279
guys buy those seed sprouting mats at

544
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,960
the hydro store they're unreliable I

545
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,879
don't [ __ ] like them don't use those

546
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,259
you're just gonna cook your seeds I also

547
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,940
think you're gonna cook your clones with

548
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:20,390
those I don't like them I don't use

549
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,700
those I get rid of them so you also said

550
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,350
uh putting mykos or something in them

551
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,090
once they crack I don't find that

552
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:28,159
necessary unless you've got old seeds

553
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:29,689
good young seeds have enough energy to

554
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,220
get themselves started they've got

555
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,289
enough energy to start their life that's

556
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,669
their whole purpose so once they start

557
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:36,440
sprouting their first set of true leaves

558
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,179
is when I is when I actually started

559
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,950
giving them any nutrients at all they

560
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,900
get to go for like five maybe seven or

561
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,250
ten days before getting fed anything at

562
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,480
all so you've heard so many techniques

563
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,130
they just get more and more complicated

564
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,720
so come in water I only do that with old

565
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,700
seats dipping them in mykos once they

566
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,019
crack that's kind of some OCD stuff and

567
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,370
not necessary but if you want to go

568
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,690
overboard and do a lot of things to your

569
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,489
plants that's cool you can do that it

570
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,740
won't hurt put them in a damp paper

571
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,808
towel until the taproot pops out that's

572
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,429
how I do it put them on top of the

573
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,149
fridge and put them in a baggie inside

574
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,470
that paper towel is a

575
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,900
really good way to make sure you don't

576
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,919
lose your moisture and ruin your seats

577
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,259
now that you've got your seedlings

578
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,720
successfully into a medium you're going

579
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,980
to have to keep that medium semi moist I

580
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,929
wouldn't soak it I wouldn't have it

581
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,610
soggy you need some air in there for

582
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,590
those roots to survive they need air in

583
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,928
the root zone but also they need plenty

584
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:28,369
of moisture to keep themselves alive

585
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,110
those roots are just starting to develop

586
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,729
they want to grow around and move around

587
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,349
through that dirt and they want to go

588
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,269
find nutrients and they want to find air

589
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,849
and they want to spread out so encourage

590
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:40,279
that by having it moist but not too wet

591
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:42,439
and also having some air in there plenty

592
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,149
of oxygen is good for your roots so

593
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,400
don't let it dry out have plenty of

594
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,048
humidity in the room don't get them too

595
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,009
cold because seedlings don't like cold

596
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:50,779
that'll really slow them down

597
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:52,220
but really make them stagnant but

598
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:54,470
probably you could kill them with too

599
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,350
cold so don't get them too cold have

600
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,940
some humidity don't put fans directly on

601
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,428
them but have some airflow in the room

602
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,080
once they start Perkin up put a fan or

603
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,610
really lightly because if you don't they

604
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,009
will start stretching and getting kind

605
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,979
of leggy on you I like to keep a t5

606
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:12,200
light right above my seedlings just a

607
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,579
little bit of t5 light is enough once

608
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,929
you get them going you can increase the

609
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,639
light you don't need a lot of light too

610
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,919
much light may be slowing you down and

611
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,360
speeding up your dry process and that

612
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,160
may kill your plants by dampening them

613
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,889
off which is the problems that people

614
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,200
seem to be having so here's a little tip

615
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,790
also once you've got your seedlings in

616
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,890
the medium and they're starting to grow

617
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,329
when it's time to water don't go in

618
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,100
there with your pitcher or your watering

619
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:35,750
can and just [ __ ] pour water in that

620
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,389
cup because you're gonna disrupt that

621
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,640
seedling what I do is get a spray bottle

622
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,470
and I put my water with a little bit of

623
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,140
nutrients in the spray bottle and I go

624
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,548
ahead and I spray that dirt and I spray

625
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,070
it real lightly until it's saturated

626
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:51,168
that way I'm not going to disrupt my new

627
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:52,730
seedling you don't need to give it

628
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,100
nutrients until you see the first set of

629
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,419
true leaves those little shitty leaves

630
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,829
where it's sprouted and spread in half

631
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,150
and popped open I always tear those

632
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:02,449
little bottom shitty leaves off they

633
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,070
never they're always weak so uh yeah

634
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,870
that's uh basically my rant on how to

635
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:08,418
get some seeds started you guys don't

636
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,659
overthink it keep them keep this in mind

637
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,460
those seeds in nature we're supposed to

638
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,919
fall out of that plant at the end of the

639
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,569
season and fall onto the ground and sit

640
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,710
there and get rained on and snowed on

641
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,689
and sit there through the winter and

642
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,090
then in the spring when that snow melts

643
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,950
and the water gets down into the soil

644
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,980
that's when it starts active

645
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,509
no seeds and they started popping up

646
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,069
don't overthink it you guys those seeds

647
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:33,589
are supposed to be sitting in dirt

648
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,179
outside getting snowed on and when the

649
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:37,189
snow melts that was what was gonna make

650
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,890
him grow you're probably making it too

651
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,900
complicated just make seeds happen super

652
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,240
simply don't overthink it keep them wet

653
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,590
don't drown them they want to be wet but

654
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,789
not drowned all right

655
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,769
because I feel like I've talked enough

656
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,849
about seeds I want to give a couple of

657
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,440
shout outs real quick and then we'll get

658
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,639
to another email I'm gonna give a huge

659
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,990
shout-out to my friend Jade

660
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,590
also a shout out to my friend Tyler

661
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,150
Maddie E and Dustin s you guys let's

662
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,909
find another quick email on this pile of

663
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,310
emails that I have got here is one from

664
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,650
our friend let's see he signed it ROG

665
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,049
and we'll read it like this hey Rasta

666
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,850
Jeff I have a mail space bomber plant I

667
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,339
cloned it once to keep it alive through

668
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:15,889
winter the clone is an 8 inch tall Bush

669
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:17,689
with balls under 18 hours of light will

670
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,490
it still be viable when I go to flower

671
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:25,070
in the spring technically yes if you can

672
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,870
keep that plant under 18 hours of light

673
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:28,549
that is the way to keep that plant in a

674
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:32,359
vegetative state which will prevent it

675
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:34,819
from flowering however it's an 8 inch

676
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,099
tall Bush with balls it's starting to

677
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:40,220
flower if it's got balls it is already

678
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:43,779
starting to flower it is probably

679
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,890
flowering because it is root bound or

680
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,990
because it's not getting fed right or

681
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,060
simply because the light cycle is off if

682
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,740
you're giving it 18 hours of light and

683
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,099
it's flowering I would recommend giving

684
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,019
it 20 or 24 hours of light something's

685
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,959
wrong if it's got balls already and

686
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,730
you're giving it 18 hours my question is

687
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,380
you've got a male plant unless you plan

688
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,990
on breeding why are you keeping a male

689
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,610
plant alive through the winter that

690
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,349
seems weird unless you plan on breeding

691
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:11,629
and then you wouldn't want to flower

692
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:13,219
that in the spring unless that male

693
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,950
plant is gonna make pollen not buds dude

694
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,380
so if it's a male I would just get rid

695
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,259
of it now and it's an 8 inch tall Bush

696
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,760
with balls it's already flowering that's

697
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,470
a problematic plant I would just toss

698
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,359
that and get yourself some fresh seeds

699
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,110
bro if you're trying to grow it in the

700
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,729
spring that's now

701
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,199
depending on where you are I would just

702
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,360
get some seeds just order some fresh

703
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,110
seeds from the hella dank seed bank at

704
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:39,579
dank seed dot store hey ROG if I

705
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,839
confused you or if you'd like to tell me

706

right podcast world how long has it been

711
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,339
since you've been on a vacation that's

712
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,230
right as a grower

713
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:58,119
I know it's nearly impossible to take a

714
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,069
vacation I like to go away for the

715
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:02,319
weekends I like to go see fish like to

716
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:04,119
sneak away and go have a good time most

717
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,250
of the time I'm gone I'm just freaking

718
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:07,719
out wondering what's going on in my

719
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,579
garden but you know what I don't freak

720
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,589
out anymore because my friends at Piell

721
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,329
grow systems have sent me the most

722
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,399
amazing device you guys I've got a

723
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:17,349
device called the minder and with the

724
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,120
minder I hung it in the grow room I put

725
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:21,339
a few things in the right spot I went to

726
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,669
a website I created an account I logged

727
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:27,129
in and now wherever I am I can open my

728
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,080
phone and I can go to pl grow dot

729
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,150
systems and I can look at what's going

730
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,949
on in my grow room from anywhere on the

731
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,810
planet as long as I've got a Wi-Fi

732
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,360
connection and I've got my phone in my

733
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:39,819
hand I can see my temps and my humidity

734
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,469
in my grow and I can make sure nothing's

735
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,089
going wrong and I can stop freaking out

736
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,279
and I can actually enjoy the Phish

737
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,769
concert so ladies and gentlemen I highly

738
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,960
recommend the minder from my friends at

739
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,119

753
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,269
to give everybody a big thank you

754
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,190
because I've been working toward a new

755
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,750
MacBook and with the help of my patreon

756
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,880
contributors and a few other things I

757
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,380
was able to order the new MacBook it's

758
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,790
not here yet it should be here by

759
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,340
Thursday so the next couple of episodes

760
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:33,220
will be recorded on the new MacBook if

761
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:35,109
things go my way thank you guys for the

762
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,640
help it's a huge deal because the

763
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,619
MacBook I'm currently recording on is

764
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,990
kind of taking a poop and it has me

765
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,489
worried it's frustrating it's not as

766
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,970
much fun recording as it could be so I'm

767
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,548
sure the new

768
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,500
is going to make this a breeze thank you

769
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:49,029
guys for the help with the new MacBook I

770
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,700
appreciate it that means a lot to me

771
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:53,678
um patreon.com slash bro from your heart

772
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,690
we've almost covered the cost of the

773
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,730
MacBook we got close I just did it

774
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,200
because it's time the things that the

775
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,150
patreon contributions will cover are

776
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,058
things like the new MacBook the website

777
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,919
these microphone covers the headphones

778
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:08,139
all these little pieces of equipment

779
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,179
they kind of crap out at random times so

780
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,038
the patreon contributions are what I use

781
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,659
to keep the equipment going to keep the

782
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,730
website alive and to keep the computer

783
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,710
up and running so thank you for the

784
