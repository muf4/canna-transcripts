00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome to the show cannabis community

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,689
it is time for episode 389 of the Grove

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,219
from your heart podcast if you've been

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,130
following along you know I've been doing

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,540
a long series of grow lessons also you

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,700
may know that I've been out of town and

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,559
I've been reposting old episodes that

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,839
fall right in line with those grow

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,698
lessons this episode is going to be a

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,859
repost but it is a good lesson on

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,289
harvesting our ripe cannabis plants I

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,090
cut out a long intro and I cut out all

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,340
of the advertising so let's jump right

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,410
into a lesson on harvesting our ripe

15
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,259
cannabis plants all right guys let's do

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,619
a podcast all about harvesting your

17
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,210
cannabis we've done an episode about

18
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,828
determining when your plants are ripe

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,200
we've done an episode about flushing

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,259
your plants before harvest now it is

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,460
harvest time in the garden there are a

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,099
couple of things we need to think about

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,929
before we go in and cut down the plants

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
first of all I should mention if this is

25
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,219
your first time cutting down cannabis

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,349
plants you thought they smelled strongly

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,448
when they were growing as soon as you

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,160
cut those [ __ ] down it's gonna double

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,808
and smell I know that sounds like I may

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,469
be making it up it sounds like I'm

31
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,950
joking

32
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:11,250
no it is going to stink it's going to be

33
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,159
ridiculous if I grow one plant in a

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,900
small house we'll say in the attic or

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,210
the basement and then I chopped that

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,180
plant down and hang it up in that attic

37
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,739
or basement the stink of that plant so

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,450
normally you can smell it to the living

39
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,670
room right to the to the living room of

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,100
the house as soon as you harvest you can

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,540
smell that [ __ ] to the driveway I don't

42
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,548
know the science behind that I don't

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,840
know if it's paranoia I don't know if

44
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,460
it's because we're moving in and out of

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,020
the grow room or I don't know exactly

46
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,688
what it is but as soon as you cut down

47
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,429
that crop it's gonna stink more than you

48
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,228
were expecting so try to be prepared for

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,350
that some things you can do to be

50
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,810
prepared are maybe getting some ona gels

51
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,269
if you know what ona gels are ona gels

52
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,579
are jars filled with this gelatinous

53
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,530
substance that just eats up odor it

54
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,078
doesn't put out an odor but it eats up

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,329
the odors in the room so you open the

56
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,978
jar I used to just set a jar of it

57
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,179
behind a house plant or behind a picture

58
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,709
you know you got a picture your daughter

59
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,240
up on the coffee table or up on the end

60
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,159
table you just stick one of these ona

61
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,689
jars opened right behind it and that

62
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,729
just starts sucking up all the odor out

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,259
of the room so put those by the doors in

64
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,068
the entryways of your house where people

65
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,688
may come in

66
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:18,780
and that way there you're sucking up

67
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:21,900
that odor and then also if you can't do

68
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,669
the ona gels maybe do something stronger

69
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,739
to cover the smell it's gonna be hard

70
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,089
like if you're you're spraying lilac air

71
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,099
freshener you're gonna smell while ACK

72
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,750
and weed the onna gels are gonna be your

73
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,598
best bet something to neutralize the

74
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,158
owner odor would be your best bet

75
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,649
another good idea if you can afford it

76
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:39,810
would be a carbon scrubber most of us

77
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,879
have a carbon filter that blows air out

78
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,378
of the grow room keep that running

79
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,348
because that's gonna keep filtering the

80
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:48,780
air and make it smell good but also get

81
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,878
a carbon filter with a blower on top of

82
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,378
it and just plug it in and let that air

83
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,000
run through the carbon filter and now

84
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,250
you're just sucking stink out of the air

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,959
cleaning up that environment so be

86
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,459
prepared it's gonna stink that is

87
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,340
something we need to start with it will

88
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,959
be stinky now before we even start

89
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,180
chopping down there's a few more things

90
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,979
to talk about where are all of these

91
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,290
plants going to go once you cut them

92
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,358
down let's plan this before we even get

93
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,340
to harvest time are you going to use

94
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,170
those circular racks that they sell at

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,908
the Gro store the multi-tiered circle

96
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,738
racks are you gonna be able to make a

97
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:22,378
line some more with string and hang them

98
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,909
that's what I prefer do you have a space

99
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:25,918
that you're going to be able to control

100
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,318
the temperature and the humidity and

101
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,939
hopefully keep the aroma under control

102
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,458
and hopefully keep light out and also

103
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,969
keep people away start thinking about

104
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,769
that around week six or seven guys let's

105
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,120
not wait until week nine to start

106
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,370
figuring out where these plants are

107
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,289
going start thinking about that early so

108
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,030
you need a place for them to hang that

109
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,219
you can control the temperature a place

110
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,079
you can control the humidity and a place

111
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,389
you can keep people out of there and

112
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,719
also you're gonna have to control that

113
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,579
aroma so have a place prepared and keep

114
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,030
in mind that if you're gonna dry your

115
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,159
buds

116
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,318
if these buds hang in your dingy funky

117
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,078
basement they're going to taste like

118
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,369
funky dingy basement you've tasted that

119
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,319
smell on buds before and you probably

120
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,000
didn't realize why does this taste like

121
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,250
the damn basement you know why because

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,769
it was dried and cured and hung for

123
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,930
seven days and somebody's funky damp

124
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,750
dirty [ __ ] basement that's exactly

125
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,489
why so have some air exchange have some

126
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,139
temperature control and have a good

127
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,339
environment you guys create a good

128
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,098
environment for your plants you've

129
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,948
gotten them this far let's not ruin them

130
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,718
if you're growing in a grow hunt

131
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,060
and you don't have another crop coming

132
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:33,949
up right behind it why not just use that

133
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,689
grow Hut as you're drying space that

134
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,098
would not be a bad idea you're

135
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,669
controlling that environment already

136
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,069
anyway

137
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:41,959
so that is always an option create a

138
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,789
good environment you guys will talk more

139
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,348
about the space in a minute you can just

140
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,788
use the grow room if you need to if you

141
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,348
don't have another crop coming up just

142
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,938
use your flower room or remove the

143
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:51,438
plants into flower use the veg room

144
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,060
that's always an option but we'll get

145
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,560
back to that don't worry you guys let's

146
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,829
talk more about the things we need to

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,718
prepare for before harvest time comes

148
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:03,318
you're going to need a few tools I

149
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:05,689
highly recommend gloves the black or the

150
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,949
blue and nitrile gloves they don't have

151
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,840
to be super thick you're just trying to

152
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,699
not get sticky you guys when you're

153
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,128
trimming weed and when you're harvesting

154
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,810
and handling this amount of weed you're

155
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,550
gonna get sticky you might want to wear

156
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,079
long sleeves you might want to wear just

157
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,788
a long sleeve over shirt that you could

158
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,829
take off when you're done you're going

159
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:25,250
to get sticky you are going to stink

160
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:27,228
some people have an allergy to cannabis

161
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,879
I've got a friend if she rubs up against

162
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:31,098
a blue dream plant she's gonna break out

163
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,710
into a giant rash so maybe cover

164
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:37,310
yourself up certainly wear gloves also

165
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:41,508
if your eye itches do never rub your eye

166
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,218
with a trichome Laden finger if your eye

167
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,229
itches and you're trim and weed take off

168
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,959
your gloves and then it's your eye with

169
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:49,399
a clean hand or if you've been trimming

170
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,109
and not wearing gloves go wash your

171
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,300
hands before you hit your eye or scratch

172
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,460
your eye because if you get resin in

173
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,759
your eye it is one of the most painful

174
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:00,799
experiences you will ever endure it

175
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,020
hurts and it won't stop I don't know

176
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,939
what makes it stop it just burns and

177
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:06,528
burns and burns and it's sticky and when

178
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,588
you blink you expect it to feel better

179
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:10,158
but it's just stickier it's so [ __ ]

180
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:14,389
miserable

181
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:16,370
so gloves a long-sleeve shirt you're

182
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,310
also gonna need some scissors

183
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,778
I recommend quality scissors you can buy

184
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,060
some cheap shitty scissors but they're

185
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:24,379
gonna break I also recommend using a

186
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,360
different pair of scissors for cutting

187
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,129
down the plants than you use for

188
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,149
trimming the plants when you're trimming

189
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,860
you're getting in there and getting the

190
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:32,418
fine details when you're cutting them

191
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,460
down you're using brute force and

192
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:37,639
cutting down tough plants you may need

193
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:39,948
some some thicker pruners you may need

194
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,410
some choppers to cut down a big plant I

195
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,819
don't know how big your stocking

196
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,320
but you want to be able to get in there

197
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,370
and cut it down easily without hurting

198
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,920
your wrist without breaking your

199
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,920
scissors so I like something that has

200
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,689
got a metal solid piece to it for

201
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,580
cutting them down not the plastic

202
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,379
scissors for cutting them down metal to

203
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:59,169
solid pieces of metal from the handle to

204
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,639
the blade then also for trimming that's

205
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,920
when I like the little Fiskars the

206
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,050
diamond tips or something similar to

207
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,900
that so something to cut down the plants

208
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,970
with scissors shears whatever you're

209
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:12,129
gonna use be prepared and if you're

210
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,530
gonna have more than one person doing

211
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:16,360
the chopping down get more than one

212
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,709
[ __ ] pair of shears there's nothing

213
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,360
more frustrating than watching people

214
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,889
stand around and not able to do work

215
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,810
because you don't have enough scissors

216
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,680
or you don't have the right tools if

217
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,899
you're gonna have a group of people

218
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,400
doing it get a group of shears I know

219
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,899
most you guys probably have a small

220
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,609
garden it's probably one or two of you

221
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,279
and you don't need giant bolt cutter

222
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,600
style shears or giant Fisker shears or

223
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,549
anything but I've been in that situation

224
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,710
before where I'm watching five guys wait

225
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,720
for work because it's just me with a set

226
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,819
of shears chopping down every plant so

227
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,070
have enough shears have enough gloves

228
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,509
maybe get a few different sizes of

229
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,579
gloves if you're gonna go buy a box of

230
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,589
gloves buy two maybe three get small

231
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,120
medium and large 'iz or maybe small

232
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,349
large and extra-large it depends on

233
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,550
who's coming over to help you out but if

234
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,020
you're gonna have people helping if

235
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,449
they're gonna be harvesting and trimming

236
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,669
with you maybe you want a few different

237
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,289
size gloves and here's something I

238
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,120
should mention if you have applied any

239
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,500
pesticides to your cannabis plants and

240
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,209
you're gonna cut them down and have

241
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,740
other people work with them maybe you

242
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,329
should politely let those people know

243
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,069
what pesticides were applied to your

244
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,629
plants so that they can wear long

245
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,009
sleeves they can wear a mask they can

246
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,439
dress appropriately based on their

247
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,329
decisions based on what pesticides you

248
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,399
have applied some things don't bother me

249
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,870
some things I would want to put on some

250
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,870
long sleeves for I'd not get that on my

251
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,569
arms just personal preferences safety

252
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,430
it's always polite anyway so the next

253
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,950
thing we should talk about is how are we

254
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,299
gonna hang these plants because the next

255
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,400
thing you gotta buy is something to hang

256
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,959
them on are you going to use so the

257
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,360
gross store sells this really nice

258
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,250
hanger it's about three feet around and

259
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,840
it hangs in the middle and then it's got

260
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,389
four or five shelves on it that you can

261
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,680
just fill with buds that's acceptable if

262
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,210
you want to cut your buds into small

263
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,609
pieces or your branches into small

264
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,230
pieces and hang it on there that's just

265
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,690
fine but that's not the way I would

266
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,399
prefer to do it

267
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,290
I prefer to hang the branches so that

268
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,089
the buds aren't touching anything so

269
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,679
that they don't get a flat spot so that

270
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,589
there's not a spot where air can't flow

271
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,179
around it I just prefer to hang them so

272
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,829
in Colorado were allowed to grow six

273
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,138
plants let's say we've got a six plant

274
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:11,789
harvest I would get six coat hangers or

275
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,409
clothes hangers and then I would get

276
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:15,929
some fishing line or some thick hemp

277
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:17,519
twine and I would anchor that to two

278
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,318
opposite ends of the room so I've just

279
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,188
got a nice piece of string hanging

280
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:22,078
across the room

281
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:23,549
now you can hitting the plants on that

282
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:26,250
string if you want to but if you're

283
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,929
using multiple strains maybe you've got

284
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,688
six different plants maybe you've got

285
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:32,789
giant plants that's when you can cut the

286
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:34,500
plant into smaller pieces and put it on

287
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,838
the coat hanger and you can label the

288
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,610
coat hanger this is all sour tangi this

289
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,230
one is all black cherry now we don't

290
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,438
have one long line of buds that get

291
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,430
confused also it makes more space

292
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:46,860
another thing you're gonna need is some

293
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:48,419
sort of labels you might want to get

294
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,100
just some white duct tape you can always

295
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,049
just peel off a piece of duct tape right

296
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,759
on that stick it wherever you want it or

297
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,769
you can get some real labels or you can

298
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,659
improvise however you need to but you're

299
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,370
going to want labels if you've got more

300
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,019
than one strain there's nothing worse

301
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,159
than getting [ __ ] confused right at the

302
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,139
end that's really frustrating so you've

303
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,870
got some way to control the odor you've

304
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,669
got a place thought of and prepared

305
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,179
where you can control the temperature

306
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,099
the humidity the lights the air flow the

307
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:18,870
aroma and the security you've got that

308
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,670
all prepared and you've got the proper

309
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,470
tools you've got gloves you've got

310
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,688
something to cut it down with you've got

311
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,180
something to hang it on now let's talk

312
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:29,539
about the room just a little bit you're

313
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:33,000
going to need I would recommend a

314
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,889
humidifier and a dehumidifier and also

315
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,509
some sort of exhaust fan to get the

316
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:38,339
stale air out of the room if it's a

317
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,839
small space you probably just crack the

318
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,949
door open but if you've got a lot of

319
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,930
plants and then you're gonna need to

320
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:44,938
exchange some air gonna need to get that

321
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,708
humid air out of there or the plants

322
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:49,679
will never dry they'll just get stagnant

323
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:52,378
and funky also I may recommend a small

324
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,088
fan you don't want air blowing directly

325
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,709
on to the buds but you want to move that

326
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,720
air around you just don't want it

327
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,859
stagnant and funky in there you really

328
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,500
want to be able to control the climate

329
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,879
also you're gonna need something to tell

330
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,409
you what's going on in there a

331
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,649
thermometer a hygrometer

332
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:10,299
perhaps a PL gros unit you want

333
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,458
something in there so you know what the

334
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:15,128
temperature is what the humidity is so

335
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,508
you can adjust accordingly now it feels

336
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:19,089
like we've talked a lot about what to

337
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,709
buy and how to prepare so let's talk a

338
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,029
little bit about the settings in the

339
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,458
room since we're talking about all this

340
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:26,409
equipment I like to put a humidifier and

341
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:29,289
a dehumidifier in the room and I set

342
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:32,019
them both at 50% that way I know that

343
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,240
that room is staying right around 50% if

344
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,759
you can set them up to something like a

345
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,259
PL bro unit or if you can set them up to

346
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,110
something that'll trigger them to go off

347
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,839
and on based on certain parameters put

348
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,810
them both at 50% have the dehumidifier

349
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,689
work to 50% have that humidifier work to

350
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:53,438
50% and keep that room at 50% humidity

351
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:55,149
as consistently as possible now it may

352
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:57,159
be a good idea to have some sort of

353
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,198
exhaust fan in the room nothing major

354
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,120
just maybe a little 4-inch exhauster if

355
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:03,128
you can do it if you can just suck the

356
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,360
air out of that room occasionally that

357
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,399
would help you out that would get that

358
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,930
old stagnant funky air out of there if

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,929
that is not an option

360
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,159
open the door put a fan by the door just

361
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,109
make sure that air exchanges

362
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
occasionally so you don't get old air in

363
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,789
there now inside this room where you've

364
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,699
got your dehumidifier your humidifier

365
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:24,269
and some air exhaust try to keep it

366
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:27,429
somewhere around 70 degrees in that room

367
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:29,139
65 to 75 degrees will be ideal any

368
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,789
hotter you're gonna speed up the drying

369
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,399
it's also gonna get funky it's gonna

370
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:35,019
increase humidity any cooler the room

371
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,198
will start getting too dry and your buds

372
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,459
will get crispy too quickly so you've

373
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,899
got your temperature you've got your

374
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,239
humidity under control you've got some

375
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:45,730
air exchange let's put a small fan in

376
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,948
the room perhaps on the floor just to

377
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,269
keep the air moving around or up high in

378
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:51,429
the room you don't want it right in the

379
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,409
middle blowing on the plants too much

380
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,239
that's gonna create a dry spot and just

381
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:57,188
dry out some of those buds too quickly

382
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,139
we just want to move the air around so

383
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:00,458
it doesn't get stale I usually get one

384
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,318
of those fans that would sit on your

385
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,808
computer desk just a desk fan it's a

386
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:06,068
little tiny like a 12 or 14 inch fan put

387
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:07,539
that in the corner on the floor if

388
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:10,149
you've got a small room that is plenty

389
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:12,068
just move the air around alright so that

390
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,139
sounds like we've got a pretty good idea

391
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:17,409
of a dry and cure space basically a

392
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,970
small room or a grow tent that you can

393
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,708
control the environment in and

394
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,170
you can hang those plants in safely

395
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:25,299
securely and in the dark if you need to

396
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,309
use a small closet you can do that just

397
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:29,889
make sure that door gets opened and

398
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:31,599
those buds don't get stale in there also

399
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,310
like I mentioned earlier if you don't

400
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,750
have sufficient drying space go ahead

401
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,878
and use the flowering room that you

402
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,559
flowered the bugs in or maybe move your

403
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,659
next round of plants from the bedroom

404
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,778
into that flower and use your bedroom

405
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:45,370
grow tents always make nice dry and cure

406
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,059
areas if you're growing in a five by

407
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,980
five tent

408
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,948
you could easily dry your whole harvest

409
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,509
and maybe a three by three tent that

410
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:55,539
wouldn't be a problem at all you don't

411
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,339
need that much room to dry your harvest

412
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:59,139
well hopefully you do [ __ ] hopefully you

413
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,240
need a ten-by-ten but that's not gonna

414
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,560
be logical alright now we know what to

415
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,870
buy we know what supplies we're gonna

416
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,758
need we've got a safe space set up for

417
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,709
our plants hopefully you've been

418
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,899
flushing your plants for ten to fourteen

419
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,669
days there's one more thing we should do

420
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,620
before we get to chopping these plants

421
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:16,328
while they are still standing up we

422
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,220
should go and take off all of the big

423
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:20,109
leaves any leaf that you can break off

424
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,759
with your hand now just go ahead and

425
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,889
take it off the plants don't need leaves

426
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,199
you're about to harvest them you can do

427
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:27,669
this seven five three days before

428
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,469
harvest you could do it right up before

429
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,568
the moment you harvest just start taking

430
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,970
off all those big leaves those leaves

431
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:35,318
are unnecessary I like to just go in and

432
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,670
throw them right on the floor to start

433
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:37,750
tearing leaves off thrown right on the

434
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,128
floor and sweep up when you're done

435
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,169
because there's gonna be a lot of them

436
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,240
just tear off all of the leaves you can

437
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,299
get you don't need those this is gonna

438
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,589
save you time when it comes harvest time

439
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,139
we're gonna cut these plants down and

440
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,759
let them dry all those long leaves are

441
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,948
just gonna dry on there and be in the

442
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,419
way and smell funky and there are stinky

443
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:57,578
[ __ ] to work through once they dry

444
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,469
they're much easier to get off now so

445
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:01,299
just snap them right off of there do you

446
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,389
leaf this [ __ ] out of the entire room

447
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,698
before you cut down any of the plants

448
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:08,308
once they are all Preedy foliated that's

449
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:11,198
what I call the pre harvest defoliation

450
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:14,019
then it is time to start chopping down

451
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,208
these plants I don't know how big your

452
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,289
plants are but this is basically how I

453
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,179
chop down a plant

454
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,828
I kneel down or if it's on a table

455
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,688
whatever I walk to it I usually kneel

456
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:24,399
down to one knee and I grab the plant

457
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,318
right above where I'm gonna cut so I've

458
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,389
got the stalk just a couple inches above

459
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:29,799
the dirt I get my loppers or whatever

460
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,870
you want to call them your pruners your

461
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,209
shears and get in there and cut right up

462
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,649
the dirt right below my hand chopped and

463
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,050
now it's gonna fall over it's gonna

464
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,028
timber on me if I got a little plant no

465
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,588
problem if I'm in a 3 or 5 gallon pot I

466
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:42,159
got this by myself if I've got a bigger

467
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,140
plant

468
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,519
I will ask somebody to help me Hey Dude

469
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,259
hold the top of this because when I cut

470
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,500
it it's gonna [ __ ] timber down on us

471
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:52,778
so I would get in there and cut it right

472
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,700
at the base if you have got maybe a

473
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:57,519
tomato cage or some trellising or

474
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,170
something like that maybe figure out how

475
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,000
to get the plant out of there by cutting

476
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,979
from the top down I like to cut the

477
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,019
whole plan out in one piece and hang the

478
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,778
whole thing upside down and let it all

479
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,819
dry in one piece that's the way I like

480
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:12,519
to do it if you put the plant in a

481
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,440
screen of green or a tomato cage you may

482
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,049
have to start at the top and cut out

483
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,720
individual branches that is just fine

484
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:22,088
make sure you get you keep each branch

485
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,620
of each strain together so that you

486
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,210
don't mix anything up I mentioned

487
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,269
earlier how frustrating that [ __ ] is

488
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,769
don't make stuff up so separate your

489
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,809
plant free your plant from its tomato

490
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,899
cage free the plant from the trellis

491
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,949
however you need to then chop it down

492
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,049
now if you've got the whole plant

493
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,390
chopped down in one piece just get a I

494
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:42,039
get a fuzzy stick is what they're called

495
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,500
they saw them at Hobby Lobby or you can

496
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,879
use the twisty ties that come with your

497
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,289
trash bags because I never use the

498
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,240
twisty ties on the trash bags anyway

499
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,219
they always end up for this purpose wrap

500
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,990
the twisty tie around the base of the

501
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,820
plant do it kind of do it securely put

502
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,500
another put a branch in there because it

503
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,810
may slide off and then tie that to

504
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,610
either your coat hanger or the line that

505
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,649
you're gonna hang it from if you've got

506
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,509
the line hanging across the room attach

507
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,369
it to that securely hang it on there in

508
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:08,318
a way that you know it's not gonna fall

509
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,649
if you've got to cut it down into

510
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,808
branches try to cut to where you create

511
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,610
little v-shape intersections and if you

512
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:17,410
hang the plant upside down you'll see

513
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,568
the little wishbone shape intersections

514
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,610
that you can use perfectly to hang your

515
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:24,369
branches on your coat hanger or on your

516
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,649
line so cut the plant flip it upside

517
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,599
down and just hang it in the size of

518
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,400
sections that you need to here's some

519
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,049
advice if you have to cut your plant

520
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,860
down into smaller sections to make it

521
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:38,319
fit make the sections similar sizes that

522
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:40,149
way they dry at similar speeds if you've

523
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,619
got one big piece and one little piece

524
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,970
that big piece is going to take longer

525
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,500
to dry than the little piece it's gonna

526
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,640
cause unevenness and you're going to be

527
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,529
confused on what to do

528
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,390
so chop everything if you're gonna chop

529
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:50,589
it let it all hang in one big piece if

530
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,320
you're gonna let it hang in one big

531
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:55,449
piece so cut the plant at the base or

532
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,279
pull out the branches hang them on the

533
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,110
coat hanger either by using the twisty

534
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,359
ties and securing it to the coat hanger

535
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:03,399
there or just by using the v-shaped

536
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,229
intersections and hanging it like a

537
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,360
little hook on the v-shaped intersection

538
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,670
and just get everything hanging safely

539
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,649
in your drying cure room chop everything

540
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,320
down and just go hang it all up you're

541
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,850
gonna be super excited now you're gonna

542
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,558
want to go post all your social media

543
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,500
about how you just took down your first

544
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,660
harvest but do not do that here is some

545
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,369
old-school advice don't post any

546
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,690
pictures or talk about your harvest

547
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,689
until it's gone

548
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,308
if it's going out for retail if it's

549
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,950
going into your jar and you're safe

550
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:34,599
that's when you talk about it don't talk

551
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,370
about it while that [ __ ] is hanging in a

552
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,009
room don't talk about it while you're

553
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:42,009
trimming it don't talk about it yet just

554
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:44,289
wait okay just wait because right now

555
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:47,140
it's hanging in a room and when you go

556
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,970
to Walmart and you post it back to

557
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,320
facebook also someone's going on your

558
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,759
back [ __ ] door and getting all your

559
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,829
weed and they're gonna trim it for you

560
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,940
and you're never gonna see any of it so

561
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:57,639
don't post yet

562
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,519
hold off just wait now if you're

563
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,380
chopping down multiple strains carefully

564
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,599
carefully carefully label these plants

565
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,650
you're gonna so I'll go back recap a

566
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,750
little bit cuz I feel like it went fast

567
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,419
grab it right above the dirt chop it

568
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,220
down it's gonna flip upside down and

569
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,600
hold it upside down either put one

570
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,130
branch over your line that you're gonna

571
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,798
hang it on and let it hang right there

572
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,510
put a label on it or put it on a coat

573
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,859
hanger just slide the one branch through

574
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,329
the coat hangers where it's got one arm

575
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,619
through and then it's just hanging put

576
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,269
it on the coat hanger or cut it into

577
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,639
smaller pieces and do it that way

578
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:30,700
label the coat hanger what strain you've

579
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,340
got so cut it down hang it up

580
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,669
label it it's gonna hang there for

581
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,199
somewhere between five and 14 maybe a

582
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,600
couple more days I haven't seen them

583
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,009
gone go more than 14 days in Colorado

584
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,959
but if you're on the coast where you've

585
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,700
got humidity you may get some more time

586
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,259
so you've chopped him down they're

587
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,179
hanging upside down you've got them

588
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,220
labeled you've got the lights

589
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,200
temperature humidity and air flow all

590
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,730
controlled in your room now you're just

591
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,340
gonna have to wait somewhere between

592
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,519
five and 14 days for those sticks to

593
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:00,019
start snapping

594
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,680
when you bend him you just want him to

595
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:05,480
go crunch you don't want him to explode

596
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,400
you don't want him to just crumble up

597
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,930
like an old bag of Doritos you just want

598
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,759
him to snap you don't want a bunch of

599
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,680
moisture in there and check a few of

600
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,319
them before you get excited but when

601
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,049
they start snapping consistently that is

602
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:21,679
when the dry phases ended and it is time

603
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:23,359
to work yourself into the cure phase all

604
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,830
right now I did skip the part about

605
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,029
putting them onto dry racks that I

606
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,980
talked about you could get from the

607
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,139
gross store the gross store sells these

608
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,490
dry racks they look like a 22 inch kick

609
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,460
drum head I think they're about 24

610
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,170
inches around they're messy and they're

611
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,870
kind of cheap but they work really well

612
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,420
you just hang it up and for this I would

613
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:45,049
probably take the buds off of the sticks

614
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,650
and just put just the buds into those

615
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,359
racks

616
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,070
I wouldn't put the sticks in there I

617
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,659
feel like the sticks are gonna take up a

618
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:52,220
lot of space in there and they also get

619
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,019
stuck in the [ __ ] netting a whole lot

620
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,480
and they're a pain in the ass I would

621
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,490
cut every single bud off of the stick if

622
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,019
it were me and I would lay the buds in

623
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,910
there and I would spread them out kind

624
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,259
of far and then every morning when I

625
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,910
wake up I would go in there and just

626
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,650
move those buds around and kind of

627
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,540
shuffle them around a little bit that's

628
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,130
not the ideal way to do it but I

629
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:12,049
understand that some of us are limited

630
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,540
on space if that's what you've got to do

631
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,309
that's what you have got to do I would

632
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,319
rather see you hang them until they dry

633
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,299
and get a little drier and as soon as

634
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,599
the stick snaps then get it off the

635
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,460
stick but I understand that sometimes

636
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,929
you've got to improvise that's part of

637
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,630
being a good grower being able to adjust

638
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,590
adapt and improvise with what you've got

639
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,050
when you've got it

640
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,939
people are so [ __ ] spoiled now we've

641
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,940
got these giant facilities with parking

642
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,640
lots and security cameras and loading

643
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,019
bays and friends when I first started

644
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,370
doing this you couldn't talk about it

645
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,809
you couldn't have your friends help you

646
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,399
carry your groceries into the house

647
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,839
because now they know you're growing and

648
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,910
they're gonna want something or they're

649
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,589
gonna [ __ ] steal it if you need more

650
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,880
space you just call a contractor and you

651
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:54,409
get a building permit and you just build

652
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,030
out another room and you've got a dry

653
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,740
and cure area back in the day we

654
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:58,879
couldn't do that you would catch people

655
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,529
drying their [ __ ] weed in the

656
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,060
bathroom hey man I got a piss well at

657
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,619
your house no bro you can't pee here

658
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,629
what man I just got a Pete no bro you

659
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,979
can't pee then you catch on later that

660
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,990
he was drying and curing his [ __ ]

661
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,849
weed in the bathroom anyway I got

662
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,319
rambley there those dry racks are cool

663
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:14,298
if that's what you got to do

664
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,250
I would prefer to hang it I'd prefer to

665
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:18,470
hang it whole plant I'd prefer to hang

666
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,500
it until it starts snapping like I said

667
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,579
that's when we enter the cure phase now

668
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,259
if you didn't have time or the

669
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:26,298
forethought to start defoliating your

670
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,589
plants before you harvested don't be

671
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:29,359
afraid to go in there and take off all

672
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:31,189
the excess leaves while they're hanging

673
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,109
upside down it is never too late to do

674
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,480
that all right you guys I feel like I

675
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:37,490
can reek rap wreak rap let's recap what

676
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,169
I said probably a recap would be better

677
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,970
for a podcast let's recap a little bit

678
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,320
you need the appropriate tools you need

679
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,240
the appropriate equipment you need a

680
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,250
good room you need to be able to control

681
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,808
the temperature and humidity you don't

682
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,028
want people getting in there you need to

683
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,319
control the aroma you're gonna need some

684
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:53,210
gloves you're gonna need something to

685
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,278
hang your plants on and you're going to

686
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,159
need some sort of labels if you're

687
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:00,558
drawing more than one strain it's a good

688
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,149
idea to start pre D foliated get in

689
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,190
there and take off the leaves before the

690
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:06,018
chopped down process is fairly simple

691
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,429
grab it chop it hanging that

692
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:09,319
[ __ ] upside down and let it

693
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,120
start drying we know what temperature

694
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,210
and humidity we need to keep the dry and

695
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,489
cure room we want about 50% about 70

696
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,990
degrees let those plants hang for four

697
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,839
or five days and start snapping the

698
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,909
stems and see if they pop it'll be 5 7

699
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,740
10 maybe 14 days before they're ready to

700
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,028
go into containers that's when we're

701
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,589
gonna jar them up that's where we're

702
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:29,690
gonna put them into containers that's

703
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:32,418
when the cure process is gonna start so

704
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,000
I think we've got a good grasp on how to

705
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,590
harvest our plants the next step in

706
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,259
harvesting you guys is to get in there

707
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:41,750
and clean and reset the grow room that's

708
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,860
right it may be time to buy new bulbs it

709
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,990
may be time to change your air

710
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:47,298
conditioner filters it is certainly time

711
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,700
to clean the cover on your carbon filter

712
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:52,308
also maybe get in there and scrub the

713
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,929
lenses if you've got glass lenses on

714
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:55,788
your ducted hoods it's a good time to

715
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,110
get in there and scrub that [ __ ] out

716
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:59,450
make sure that everything is nice and

717
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:01,308
clean clean the room with a cleaning

718
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,500
product maybe some bleach maybe some

719
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:05,298
flies in whatever you've got get in

720
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,028
there and clean the [ __ ] out of the grow

721
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:10,009
room but get in the corners get in all

722
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:11,569
the spots you've been missing if you

723
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,970
plan on using your grow room or your

724
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:15,230
grow Hut as your drawing space that's a

725
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,759
good excuse but you're gonna have to

726
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,528
clean it as soon as you're done with

727
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,849
that as soon as those plants come out of

728
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:21,769
there and you're trimming you should

729
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:23,750
take a break and go clean the [ __ ] out

730
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,309
of your grow space before you put more

731
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,470
plan

732
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:29,379
there that is the completion of your

733
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,450
harvest that is also the completion of

734
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,010
your harvest lesson ladies and gentlemen

735
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,759

736
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:37,509

737
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,519

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,240
cutting clones and getting a grouse

746
